## 1 Introduction

Studio Pro [9.18](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.18/) and above integrates with Mendix Business Events module functionality. With the [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/modules/business-events/) module, applications can signal when something important happens, and can independently subscribe to these events if they want to be informed. Business events are like a mailing list to share event notifications between apps.

You must have the [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/modules/business-events/) module installed for it to work properly. If it is not installed, you will be prompted to download it and add it to your app.

### 2 Published Business Event Service

A **Published Business Event Service** is the contract defining various events, like a REST API spec. To add a published business event service, right-click on a module in your app and go to **Add other** > **Published Business Event Service**.

See the [Publishing Business Events](/appstore/modules/business-events/#publish-be) section of *Mendix Business Events* for more extensive documentation.

### 3 Consumed Business Event Service

In order to start consuming a business event contract, you first need to create a **Consumed Business Event Service**. Right-click on a module in your app and go to **Add other** > **Consumed Business Event Service**.

See the [Consuming Business Events](/appstore/modules/business-events/#consume-be) section of *Mendix Business Events* for more extensive documentation.
