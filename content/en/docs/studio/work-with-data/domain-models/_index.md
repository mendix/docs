## 1 Introduction

The Mendix app consists of *modules*. A module is a unit that divides functionality of your app into separate parts. By default, you have one module in Studio called MyFirstModule. 

Each module has its own *domain model*. The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. It is central to the architecture of your application. 

The domain model in Studio consists of the following:

* [Entities](#entity-types)
* [Associations](/studio/domain-models-association-properties/) 

Let us say you have a collection of CDs like the one in the table below:

| Title                           | Artist                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb | U2                       |
| Exodus                          | Bob Marley & The Wailers |

The rows in the table are CDs. So, a *CD* is an *entity*. A specific CD like "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" of the band U2 is an *object* of the *CD* entity. That means that an *object* is a single instance of an entity. Characteristics like the "Title" and "Artist" are *attributes*.

To view the **Domain Models** of your app in Studio, click the **Domain Models** icon in the left menu bar of Studio.

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/domain-model.png" >}}

After opening a domain model, you will see an overview of all entities, attributes, and associations. The complexity of your domain model depends on the complexity of your app.

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/domain-overview.png" >}}

The **Auto Arrange** option in the upper-left corner groups and aligns entities by associations. Entities with no associations will be vertically aligned. 

## 2 Components 

The domain model can contain the following components:

* [Entity](#entity-types) – represents a class of real-world objects; entities can have attributes
    * [Attribute](#attributes) – describes and/or identify the entity
* [Association](#associations) – describes a relation between entities

### 2.1 Entities and Their Types {#entity-types}

An entity represents a class of real-world objects, such as customers, invoices, work items, etc. If we draw a parallel with databases, the entity is a table.

You can add different type of entities to your domain model:

* **Entity** – an entity that can have attributes, associations, and represents a class of real-world objects.
* **Image Entity** – a special type of entity that allows you to store an image. For example, on pages, users will be able  to view and upload images with the help of an image entity.
* **File Entity** – a special type of entity that allows you to store a file. For example, on pages, users will be able to upload and download files (such as, a text document, a pdf, a spreadsheet) with the help of a file entity.
* **Workflow Entity** – a special type of entity that is used as a context for a [workflow](/studio/workflows/). 
* **External Entity** – only available if you have the Data Hub functionality enabled for your organization. For more information on external entities, see [Data Hub in Studio](/studio/data-hub-in-studio/).

### 2.2 Entity Properties

Entities have the following properties:

* **General** properties define the name of the entity and its [persistability](/refguide/persistability/):

    * **Name** – defines the name of the entity

    * **Persistable** – defines whether objects of the entity are stored in the database (for more information on persistability, see [Persistability](/refguide/persistability/) in the *Studio Pro Guide*)

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/entity-general-properties.png" alt="General Properties of an Entity" >}}

* **Stored Information** properties define whether the information about the entity is stored in the database. If the information is stored, it can be retrieved afterwards and can be used in [page filters](/studio/data-filters/). For example, you can add a filter and show only objects that were created by the current user. 

    You can toggle the following properties: 

    * **Store 'Created by'** – when enabled, the user who created the entity is stored in the database

    * **Store 'Creation Date'** – when enabled, the date and time when the entity was created is stored in the database

    * **Store 'Last Changed by'**– when enabled, the user who was the last to make changes to the entity is stored in the database

    * **Store 'Last Changed Date'** – when enabled, the date and time when the entity was last changed is stored in the database

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/entity-stored-info.png" alt="Stored Information Properties of an Entity" >}}

        {{% alert color="info" %}}You cannot toggle **Stored Information** properties for Image, File, and Workflow entities.{{% /alert %}}

### 2.3 Attributes {#attributes}

Attributes are characteristics that describe and/or identify the entity. For example, a *Customer* entity typically has attributes for the name of the customer, an e-mail address, and other personal information. If we draw a parallel with databases, the attribute is a column. 

For more information on attribute types and their properties, see [Attributes](/studio/domain-models-attributes/). 

### 2.4 Associations {#associations}

An association describes a relation between entities. In the domain model, an association is represented by a line between two entities. If we draw a parallel with databases, the association is a foreign key. 

For more information on association types and their properties, see [Associations](/studio/domain-models-association-properties/).  

## 3 Adding New Entities {#adding-new-entities}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This section describes how to create an entity in the domain model editor, but you can also create entities from a page. For more information, see the [Creating an Entity from a Page](/studio/page-editor/#create-entity) section in *Pages*. 

{{% /alert %}}

You can add new entities in the **Toolbox**. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/toolbox-entity.png"   width="300"  >}}

To add an entity, do the following:

1. Open the **Toolbox** tab of the domain model.

2. Choose the entity type you would like to add, and drag and drop it the working area.

3.  Fill out the name for the entity and click **Create**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/create-new-entity-dialog.png" >}}

The new entity is added to the domain model.

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/new-entity.png"   width="250"  >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

You can also create entities from a page. For more information, see the [Creating an Entity from a Page](/studio/page-editor/#create-entity) section in *Pages*. 

{{% /alert %}}

### 3.1 Adding New Image or File Entities {#adding-image-or-file-entities}

While adding new entities from the **Toolbox** works for all types of entities, you can use a specific way of adding image and file entities to your domain model.

For example, you have an entity named *Laptop* and you want to be able to show users a specific image depending on the laptop model. In this case, you need to create an image entity (for example, named *Product_Image*). However, to get data and dynamically show the right image per laptop model, the *Product_Image* entity should also have a specific connection (an association) to the *Laptop* entity. For more information on associations and their types, see [Associations](/studio/domain-models-association-properties/). 

To create a new image/file entity with an association automatically, follow the process described below:

1. Select an entity of the *Entity* type that will have a connection to the new image or file entity. 

2. Click **New attribute** button.

3.  In the **Create New Attribute** dialog box, click **Add image or file** in the lower-right corner:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/add-image-or-file.png" alt="Add Image or File" >}}

4. In the **Image and Files** dialog box, select the type or entity (image or file).

5. In the **Create New Image/File Entity** dialog box, specify the name of the special entity and click **Create**. 

The new image or file entity is created with default *Name* and *Size* attributes and the association to the entity that you selected in the first step:
{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/image-entity-example.png" alt="Image Entity Example" >}}

## 4 Adding New Attributes {#adding-new-attributes}

To add attributes in the domain mode, do the following: 

1.  Select a block with entity you want to add an attribute to. The **New attribute** option appears:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/adding-attribute.png"   width="250"  >}}

2.  Click **New attribute** and specify its **Name** and **Type**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/create-new-attribute-dialog.png" >}}

3. Click **Create**.

A new attribute is added to the entity. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/new-attribute.png"   width="250"  >}}

## 5 Adding New Associations

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This section describes how to create an association in the domain model editor, but you can also create associations from a page. For more information, see the [Creating an Association from a Page](/studio/page-editor/#create-association) section in *Pages*. 

{{% /alert %}}

There are several ways to add an association in the domain model. You can do one of the following:

1. Click the dot icon that appears and do one the following:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/adding-association-dot-icon.png" >}}

    1. To create an association with an existing entity, drag the dot to the second entity. 

    2.  To create an association with a new entity, drag the dot icon and hold it for a couple of seconds until it turns into a plus icon. By dropping the plus icon, you can create a new entity with an association from the first entity:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/plus-icon.png" >}}

4. Select a block with an entity you want to add an association to do the following:

    1.  Click the arrow icon:
    
        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/adding-association.png"   width="250"  >}}

    2.  Select a second entity for the new association from the list of existing entities and click **Select**. You can also create a new entity for the association from the dialog box. 

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/new-association.png" >}}

        A module name is indicated next to the entity name in brackets. 
    
        {{% alert color="info" %}} If you select the entity from another module, you will create a cross-module association. For more information, see the [Cross-Module Associations](/studio/domain-models-association-properties/#cross-module-associations) section in *Associations*. The entities of the current module are listed first.     
        {{% /alert %}}
        
        

## 6 Specifying Properties

In the domain model, you can manage the properties of entities, attributes, and associations on the **Properties** tab.

At the bottom of the tab you can see the **Delete** button.

### 6.1 Specifying Entity Properties

You can manage the following properties of an entity:

* The **Name** of the entity

* [Persistability](/refguide/persistability/) of the entity

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/entity-properties.png" >}}

To change the entity properties, click the entity in the domain model. The **Properties** tab for the selected entity is displayed automatically. 

### 6.2 Specifying Attribute Properties

You can manage the following properties of an attribute:

* The **Name** of the attribute
* The [Type](/studio/domain-models-attributes/)  of the attribute

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/attribute-properties.png" >}}

To change the attribute properties, click the attribute in the domain model. The **Properties** tab for the selected attribute is displayed automatically. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/selecting-attribute.png" >}}


{{% alert color="info" %}}

Fields that are displayed in **Properties** may vary depending on the type of the attribute.

{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Properties of *Name* and *Size* attributes of image and file entities are read-only, as in, you cannot edit them. 

{{% /alert %}}

### 6.3 Specifying Association Properties

You can manage the following properties of an association:

*   The **Name** of the association
*   **Multiplicity** of the association
*   The delete behavior of the objects

For more information, see [Associations](/studio/domain-models-association-properties/). 

To change the association, click the line in the domain model. The **Properties** tab for the selected entity is displayed automatically. 

If the association type is one-to-many or many-to-many, you can swap direction of it clicking the corresponding icon. For more information, see section [3 Multiplicity](/studio/domain-models-association-properties/#multiplicity) in *Associations*. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/managing-associations.png"   width="350"  >}}

## 7 Deleting Entities, Attributes, or Associations

To delete an entity, attribute, or association, do the following:

1. Select the entity, attribute or association you want to delete.

2.  Press **Delete** or click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the **Properties** tab.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/work-with-data/domain-models/deletion.png"   width="300"  >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

You cannot delete *Name* and *Size* attributes of image and file entities.
