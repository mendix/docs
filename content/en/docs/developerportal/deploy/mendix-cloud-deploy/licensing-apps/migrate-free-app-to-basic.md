    Before your environment is deleted, you may be asked to **authenticate** with two-factor authentication.

### 3.4 Link your app to the new node

2. Click **Use this node** for the node that you just licensed.

    You may have to **confirm** and **authenticate** this with **two-factor authentication** again.

### 3.5 Configure Your Environment

Before your app can be deployed live, You might need to configure your environment details. This is only required if you have some special configurations or you have to specify settings in order for your functionality to work. For example, if your app makes use of scheduled events or application constants, you can configure them here. See [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) for more information about configuring your environment.

### 3.6 Deploy your app

Now you need to deploy your app! In order to do so, you will need a deployment package.

1. Create a deployment package using Environments methods described on the [deployment package documentation page](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#package-from-team-server).
2. Select the deployment package you just created and click **Deploy** to publish your app to production.

### 3.7 Upload and Restore the Backup

The final step is to restore your data. This must be done after you've deployed your app as this ensures that a database has been provisioned ready to accept your data.

1. Go back to the **Backups** page.

2. Click **Upload Backup**.

3. Select the backup file you downloaded earlier. The file will be uploaded.

    Once done, a backup file is uploaded to your app using the data from your old Free App environment.

4. Select the backup you just uploaded and click **Restore**.

5. Click **Restore Backup**.

Make sure your app is not running before you restore a backup. You can stop your running app on the Environments page.
