### 3.4 Viewing Elements On a Page

## 4 Breadcrumb Trail

When you select an item on your page, there appears a breadcrumb trail in the left bottom corner of the Web Modeler.

The breadcrumb trail serves two functions:

* Shows a bottom-up layering of a selected item on a page
* Allows the user to select an element on the page and view its properties 

For example, when you select a button on a page, you will see that it is placed in a container, which is in a column.  Whereas, the column is in a row, and this row is placed in a layout grid on the page.

To view information on the element click this element in the breadcrumb trail and its properties are displayed automatically.

### 4.1 Viewing Navigation Layout Information with Breadcrumb Trail

You can also view the information on Navigation layout by clicking it in the breadcrumb trail.

The following options will be displayed in the **Properties** tab:

## 5 Toolbox Tab

The **Toolbox** shows the tools that can be used in the Page editor. 

This tab consists of the following:

* [Building Blocks](#building-blocks)
* [Widgets](#widgets)

### 5.1 Building Blocks {#building-blocks}

Building blocks consist of pre-set widgets that allow you to build a page faster: you only need to drag-and-drop them to the page.  

![](attachments/page-editor-wm/wm-buildingblocks.png)

Building blocks of the Web Modeler are divided into the following categories:

| Building Block | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Headers        | A header combines the functionality of a page title and a control bar for your page. Due to its compact design and versatility it is often used in mobile pages. |
| Lists          | Use these blocks when you need to display a list of data.    |
| Cards          | Cards contain diverse building blocks for different purposes. |
| Charts         | Use these building blocks if you want to present your data as a chart. |
| Forms          | Use these building blocks for a form to be filled out by users in your app. |
| List Controls  | Represent data as a control list and help you to sort and search items in the list. |
| Master Detail  | Use these building blocks to display the list of many items, but to show the details only for the selected element. |
| Breadcrumbs    | Use these building blocks when you want to show the current page location in your application. |
| Timeline       | Contains building blocks that show a list of events.         |
| Wizards        | Use these building blocks for inputting information step by step. |
| Notifications  | Contain building blocks used for different notifications.    |
| Alignments     | Use these building blocks to align elements.                 |

To insert a building block, drag and drop the selected building block on the page.

If you want to read documentation on a particular building block and to know more about how and when to use it, click the small icon in the top right corner of the building block.
