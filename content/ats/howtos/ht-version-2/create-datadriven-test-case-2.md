## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains data-driven testing, a functionality of ATS. With data-driven testing, you can run the same test case with different data sheets without manually entering the new information in the case. ATS executes a test case for each record in the master data set.

**This how-to will teach you  how to do the following**

* Create a master data set with different datasheets in ATS
* Create an Excel file to upload in ATS
* Create a master data set using an Excel file
* Use the master data set in a test case
* Understand the result log of a data-driven test case

This how-to uses the Company Expenses app as an example. In the how-to, you will create data for the following fields in the Company Expenses app:

* Amount
* Date
* Type
* Description

An example test case is used to illustrate how to connect the data set to a test case.

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* Read [How to Create a Test Case](create-a-test-case-2)

## 3 Creating a Master Data Set within ATS

The following steps explain how to create a master data set within ATS. If you want to create a master data set from an Excel file, please see chapter four.

1. Open your app in ATS and go to the **Test Cases** menu item.
2. Click the **Test Data** tab.
3.  Click **New Data Set**

   ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/test-cases-data-sets-new-data-set.png)

   When you click the **New Data Set**, the **New Data Set** dialog box opens.

   ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/new-data-set-dialog.png)

4. Enter a name for your data set in the **Name** field. Remember that you must find the data set later, so give it a unique and corresponding name.
5. Enter a description for your data set in the **Description** field. Providing a clear description of what data is found inside is advisable.
6.  Click **Save**.

### 3.1 Creating Data Set Fields

The following steps explain how to add data set fields to your master data set.

1. Click the name of the data set.
2.  Click **New Field**.

    ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/add-new-field-data-set.png)

3. When you click **New Field**, the **New Field** dialog box opens. Enter **Amount** in the name field. This field represents the expense amount in the Company Expenses app. By using the exact label from the Mendix app, it becomes easier to connect the fields from your data set to the right action.
4. The amount in the Company Expenses app can only be a number. Select **Number** as the datatype.
5.  Click **Save**

   ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/new-data-set-field-amount.png)

Repeat steps 1 to 5 for these fields in the Company Expenses app:

* Date
* Type
* Description

The result will look comparable to the image below:

![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/all-fields-new-expense-data-set.png)

 Next, you create a record for the data set fields.

### 3.2 Creating Records

To create a record for your data set fields, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Records** tab.
2.  Click **New Record**:

    ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/click-new-record.png)

    The **New Record** dialog box opens:

    ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/new-record-dialog.png)

3.  Enter the desired values for each field and click **Save**:

    ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/entered-new-record.png)

Repeat step 2 and step 3 as many times as you want. In our example, we create a record for each expense type:

* Accommodation
* Meal
* Other
* Supplies
* Transport

The records look like this:

![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/all-records-new-expense.png)

You can also update your records from Excel.  For details on how to do this, see [5 Creating a Master Data Set with Excel](#create).

## 4 Creating the Excel File<a name="excel"></a>

The following steps explain how to create the right Excel file and how it should look. You will need this file in [5 Creating a Master Data Set with Excel](#create).

1.  Open Excel and create a new file. ATS implements the values in the first row as data set fields and all the rows beyond the first row as records. This is an example:

    ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/excel-sheet-example-ats.png)

2.  Create the data set fields you need:

    * Amount
    * Date
    * Type
    * Description

   ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/excel-sheet-data-set-fields.png)

3.  Now you must add records. Create a record for each expense type available, five in total:

    * Accommodation
    * Meal
    * Other
    * Supplies
    * Transport

    ![](attachments/create-datadriven-test-case-2/excel-sheet-add-records-new-expense.png)

4. Save the Excel file so that you can use it in the next section.

## 5 Creating a Master Data Set with Excel<a name="create"></a>
