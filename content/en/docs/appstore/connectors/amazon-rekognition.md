## 1 Introduction

[Amazon Rekognition](#needs-url) offers pre-trained and customizable computer vision (CV) capabilities to extract information and insights from your images.

### 1.1 Features

This connector can be used when you need to extract information from images and photos, such as where faces are located within an image. This module also supports features like the following:

- Identify if a person in an image is wearing protective equipment
- Where labels are located within an image
- Comparing faces from two different images
- Identify custom labels like your logo in images

### 1.2 Prerequisite

This module requires the [Amazon Authentication V2](#needs-url) Connector from the Marketplace.

## 2 Configuration

### 2.1 Entities

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BoundingBoxCompareFace` | `AmazonRekognitionConnector.BoundingBox`    | This entity contains the bounding box results for the `CompareFaces` action. It includes the left (x) coordinates, top (y) coordinates, and the image's width and height. It is a specialization of the `BoundingBox` generalization entity. |
| `PolygonTextDetect` | `AmazonRekognitionConnector.Polygon`          | This entity contains the polygon results for the `DetectText` action. It includes x and y coordinates. It is a specialization of the `Polygon` generalization entity. An array of Point objects, Polygon, is returned by `DetectText` and `DetectCustomLabels` or used to define regions of interest in Amazon Rekognition Video operations such as `CreateStreamProcessor`. Polygon represents a fine-grained polygon around a detected item. |
| `CompareFaces` |                                             | This entity is the root object for the Amazon's `CompareFaces` service. |
| `FaceToBeCompared` | `AmazonRekognitionConnector.Face`             | This entity contains the face results for the `CompareFace` action. It includes a confidence. Additionally it is used to hold information over associations regarding the face properties such as the bounding box, face ID, image ID of the input image, and external image ID that you assigned. It is a specialization of the `Face` generalization entity. |
| `MatchedFace` |                                             | This entity holds the information on the level of similarity of the matched face with the face to be compared. The similarity is the level of confidence that the source image and target image are a match. |
| `DetectFaces` |                                             | This entity is the root object for the Amazon's `DetectFaces` service. It includes the orientation correction. |
| `AgeRange` |                                             | This entity contains the estimated age range, in years, for a detected face. This includes the high and low, where the high represents the ceiling of the range and low represents the floor of the range. Amazon Rekognition estimates an age range for faces detected in the input image. Estimated age ranges can overlap. A face of a 5-year-old might have an estimated range of 4-6, while the face of a 6-year-old might have an estimated range of 4-8. |
| `Beard` | `AmazonRekognitionConnector.PhysicalProperty` | This entity contains the beard results for the `DetectFaces` action. It includes a confidence and value. It is a specialization of the `PhysicalProperty` generalization entity. |
| `Eyeglasses` | `AmazonRekognitionConnector.PhysicalProperty` | This entity contains the eyeglasses results for the `DetectFaces` action. It includes a confidence and value. It is a specialization of the `PhysicalProperty` generalization entity. |
| `EyesOpen` | AmazonRekognitionConnector.PhysicalProperty | This entity contains the eyes open results for the `DetectFaces` action. It includes a confidence and value. It is a specialization of the `PhysicalProperty` generalization entity. |
| `Gender` |                                             | This entity holds the prediction of the gender of a detected face. The entity includes a confidence and value, the confidence is level of confidence of the prediction and the value is the predicted gender of the face. Amazon Rekognition makes gender binary (male/female) predictions based on the physical appearance of a face in a particular image. This kind of prediction is not designed to categorize a person’s gender identity, and you shouldn't use Amazon Rekognition to make such a determination. For example, a male actor wearing a long-haired wig and earrings for a role might be predicted as female. Using Amazon Rekognition to make gender binary predictions is best suited for use cases where aggregate gender distribution statistics need to be analyzed without identifying specific users. For example, the percentage of female users compared to male users on a social media platform. We do not recommend using gender binary predictions to make decisions that impact an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services. |
