### 1.1 App Team {#app-team}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
To view the App Team, you must have the **App Settings** permission or a default **Scrum Master** role.
{{% /alert %}}

The **App Team** tab lets you view and delete the team members that are currently working on the app. Each member has a **Role**. You can change the role of each team member to the following:

* Application Operator
* Business Engineer
* Guest
* Performance Engineer
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master

For more information, see [App Roles](../collaborate/app-roles).

### 1.2 Node Permissions

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Node permissions are only available for Licensed Apps.
{{% /alert %}}

The **Node Permissions** tab lets you view the team members that have the App Team permission to view, deploy, and monitor the node.  A **Technical Contact** can grant those team members certain permissions.

For more information, see [Node Permissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions).
