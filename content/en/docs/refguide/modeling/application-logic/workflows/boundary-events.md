Non-interrupting boundary events were in public beta in Studio Pro 10.15 and released in GA in Studio Pro 10.16.

## Introduction

Based on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0, boundary events are a type of event that is attached to the boundary of an activity (such as a task or a sub-process) to handle exceptional situations or are triggered by certain behaviors. 

There are two main types of boundary events:

* Non-interrupting boundary events: These events do not interrupt the ongoing activity. When triggered, they allow the activity to continue while simultaneously starting a new path from the boundary event. As per BPMN 2.0 specification, non-interrupting boundary events are visualized as two dashed circles with an icon in the center.
* Interrupting boundary events: When these events are triggered, they interrupt the normal path of the activity they are attached to. The activity stops and the process flow is redirected to the boundary event's outgoing sequence path. As per BPMN 2.0 specification, interrupting boundary events are visualized as two solid circles. 
    {{% alert color="info" %}}Interrupting boundary events are not available yet in the current release.{{% /alert %}}

Boundary Events are always displayed by 2 circles (either solid or dashed) and are linked by a dotted line to the parent activity. The icon inside the event indicates the type of event. For example, a clock indicates that it is a timer boundary event.

Below is an example of how a timer boundary event looks like:

Studio Pro now supports the following boundary event:

* [Timer](/refguide/timer/)

## Getting started

<a id="supported-activities"></a>You can add boundary events to the following activities:

* [Wait for notification](/refguide/wait-for-notification/)
* [User task](/refguide/user-task/) 
* [Multi-user task](/refguide/multi-user-task/)
* [Call microflow](/refguide/call-microflow/)
* [Call workflow](/refguide/call-workflow/)

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When a boundary event is added to an activity, this activity is also referred to as the parent activity of the boundary event.

### Adding Boundary Events

To add a boundary event to the [above-listed activities](#supported-activities), choose one of the following ways:

* Select an event from the **Events** section in the workflow **Toolbox** and drag it onto one of the activities listed above.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/boundary-events/drag-drop.png" alt="Adding boundary events through drag and drop" width="200" >}}

* Right-click one of the above-listed activities to open its context menu, and click **Add boundary event**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/boundary-events/context-menu.png" alt="Adding boundary events through context menu" width="200" >}}

* Double-click one of the above-listed activities to open its properties dialog box, go to the **Events** tab, and in the > **Boundary events** section, click **New** to add a new boundary event.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/boundary-events/edit-dialog.png" alt="Adding boundary events through edit dialog" width="450" >}}

To configure the properties of a boundary event, double-click the event to open its properties dialog box. For more information on how to configure the properties of a timer boundary event, see the [Properties](/refguide/timer/#properties) section in *Timer*.

### Rearranging Boundary Events

You can rearrange boundary events in the following ways:

* Right-click a boundary event to open its context menu and click **Move boundary event left** or **Move boundary event right**, or use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Command</kbd> + Left arrow or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Command</kbd> + Right arrow shortcut keys.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/boundary-events/arrange-in-editor.png" width="400px" alt="Timer Event arrange in editor" >}}

* Double-click the parent activity to open its properties dialog box and click **Move up** or **Move down**  to change the order of the boundary events' paths.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/boundary-events/arrange-in-dialog.png" width="400px" alt="Arrange non-interrupting boundary event in dialog" >}}

    {{% alert color="info" %}}This does not change the order execution of the paths, as this is dependent on the expiration of the timer.{{% /alert %}}

## Execution

Boundary events are initiated when their parent activity is initiated. For example, for a timer with a fixed duration, it will start its count down when the parent activity is initiated. When the parent activity is completed before any of the boundary events are triggered, none of the activities in the boundary event path will be executed and all timers will be cancelled.

With non-interrupting boundary events, the parent activity remains active/in progress when a boundary event is triggered (which means that the parent activity is not interrupted). For example, when a timer boundary event on a user task is triggered after 2 days, this task will remain in progress and the path defined below the timer boundary event is executed. When the boundary event's path reaches the **End of boundary path**, the workflow will await the completion of the parent activity. 

## Boundary Event Variables

Boundary events have dedicated variables that can be used to get direct access to the values of the parent activity if it is either a user ask or Call workflow activity. For example, you can get information such as the parent activity's `DueDate`, which can be used in the boundary event flow and its expressions.

The list of variables is described below: 

* `$ParentTask` – the parent user task of the attached boundary event
* `$CalledWorkflowInstance` – the parent Call workflow activity of the attached boundary event

## Current Limitation

The current release of boundary events has the following limitation which is actively being developed:

* Non-interrupting timer boundary events currently have no recurrence. They are only executed once and will not repeat.
