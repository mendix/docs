The Offline Device profile allows users to continue using their Mendix application, even without a working internet connection. The Offline Device profile can be reached (when enabled) by accessing the application with an offline enabled PhoneGap hybrid application. A number of restrictions apply to pages available to the Offline Device profile, whic you can find [here](offline).

In Mendix 6.10.4 the Offline Device profile is replaced by the [Hybrid Phone profile](hybrid-phone-profile). All settings from the Offline device profile are automatically copied to the Hybrid Phone profile.
