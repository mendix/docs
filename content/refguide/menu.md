A menu document defines a navigation menu that can be used by a [menu widget](menu-widgets). Typically the main menus for your application are defined in [device types](desktop-profile), while you use menu documents for auxiliary menus, e.g. a side bar.

A menu consists of a list of menu items, which optionally contain sub-items. Depending on the widget a number of levels are allowed.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

If [security](project-security) is enabled, the menu will only show items that the user has access to.

{{% /alert %}}
