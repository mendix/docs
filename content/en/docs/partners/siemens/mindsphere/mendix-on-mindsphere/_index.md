## 1 Introduction

If you want to have full integration with MindSphere, incorporating your application into the MindSphere Launchpad, managing the user access via the MindSphere Settings app, supporting OEM based use cases via [subtenancy](https://developer.mindsphere.io/howto/howto-subtenant-management.html), or offering your Mendix application within the MindSphere ecosystem to other MindSphere customers (multitenancy), then **Mendix on MindSphere** is the right choice.

## 2 Mendix on MindSphere {#mendix-on-mindsphere}

With Mendix on MindSphere, a Mendix app can be fully integrated into Siemens MindSphere's application lifecycle. This includes the capability to provide your app to third parties in the MindSphere eco system. To find out how to develop and deploy your app to Siemens MindSphere, see [Siemens MindSphere – Deployment](/developerportal/deploy/deploying-to-mindsphere/) or have a look at the Mendix Academy Learning paths:

* [Build a MindSphere app with Mendix](https://academy.mendix.com/link/path/80/Build-a-MindSphere-app-with-Mendix) - this Learning Path will teach you how to develop an app for MindSphere with Mendix
* [Build a MindSphere App - Continued](https://academy.mendix.com/link/path/93/Build-a-MindSphere-App---Continued) - this Learning Path is for everyone who wants to dive more deeply into how to build a MindSphere App with the Mendix Platform

Once your app is registered in MindSphere, there are a number of things you need to consider as you develop your Mendix app. These are covered in the following two documents:

* [MindSphere Development Considerations](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-development-considerations/) – covers things which you should address when developing for MindSphere, including the following:

    * [Cloud Foundry environment variables](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-development-considerations/#cfenvvars)
    * [Local testing](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-development-considerations/#localtesting)
    * [Multi-tenancy](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-development-considerations/#multitenancy)
    * [Validation<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;">](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-development-considerations/#validation)

* [MindSphere Module Details](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-module-details/) – describes more technical details about the MindSphere modules that you need to include in your Mendix app to enable it to run on MindSphere

If you want to work with an example application, look at the following document:

* [How to  Use the Siemens MindSphere Operations Insight Example App](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-example-app/) – this contains documentation and assistance in using the Operations Insight Example App available in the Marketplace
