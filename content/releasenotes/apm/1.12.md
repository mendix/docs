## 1.12.0

This release is identical to the [1.11.0](1.11) release, but it is for Mendix 7.0.2 and above.

### Other Fixes

* For version 7, Mendix changed the client API for `keepalive` not to include parameters. This has been handled now.
* Refreshing data in Mendix 7 where only calculated attributes were changed did not always refresh the screen. By committing the settings records as a workaround, the APM tools now function as expected.
