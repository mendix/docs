For details on how this works in Mendix versions 7.2 and 7.3, see [Navigation in 7.2 and 7.3](navigation-in-72-and-73). For Mendix version 7.4 and higher, see [Navigation](navigation).

When enabled, all users accessing the Mendix application from a smart phone will automatically be redirected to this profile. If disabled, smart phone users will be redirected to the [tablet profile](tablet-profile). Lacking that, the user will be redirected to the [desktop profile](desktop-profile).
