## 1 Introduction {#studio-overview}

Mendix Studio is the place where you can create, view and edit your Mendix applications without going into technical details. For this purpose you can use the [Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling) and [develop apps together with Studio Pro users](general-collaborative-development) anytime. 

With Studio you can create and edit applications in your browser without installing software on your PC.   

The picture below shows the components of Studio's interface:

## 2 Opening Studio

The app opens in Studio.

## 3 Upgrading Studio

After clicking **Edit in Studio** you may need to upgrade your app to the latest version.

{{% /image_container %}}

You may also see an orange top bar suggesting an upgrade to the next Mendix version. For more information on Studio upgrades and Mendix versions, see [Studio Ranges & Mendix Versions](general-versions).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
When you upgrade your app in Studio to the latest  Mendix version, you will need to upgrade your app in the Studio Pro to the same version as well. 

If you are working in a team with others, it is wise to check with your team members if everyone is OK to upgrade the app to the latest Mendix version. The reason for this is that once you update Studio, you need to update Studio Pro as well.

## 8 Cut/Copy/Paste Function 

You can copy and paste pages and microflows. You can also cut, copy, and paste separate elements such as widgets or microflow activities. 

### 8.1 Copy/Paste Pages, Microflows, and Enumerations {#copy-paste-documents}

Pages, microflows, and enumerations can be copied to clipboard and then pasted to a different Studio app. You can also copy and paste pages, microflows, and enumerations to the same app, however, there is the **Duplicate** option you can use for this purpose. For more information on how to copy, paste, or duplicate pages, microflows, and enumerations, see [Pages](page-editor), [Microflows](microflows), and [Enumerations](domain-models-enumeration) respectively.  

Mind the following when copying and pasting pages, microflows, and enumerations:

* You can copy/paste pages, microflows, and enumerations only to Studio apps that have the same Mendix version 
* You can copy/paste pages, microflows, and enumerations only between instances of the same browser
* You *cannot* copy/paste from Studio to Studio Pro or vice versa

### 8.2 Cut/Copy/Paste Separate Elements

Cut/copy/paste function is available in all editors of Studio: pages, microflows, domain models, and navigation document. To cut/copy/paste you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> /  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> or  <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> /  <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. 

Mind the following characteristics when using cut/copy/paste:

* You can cut/copy/paste elements within one editor; that means that you can cut/copy/paste elements within one page or to other pages in Studio, and copy microflow activities within one microflow or to other microflows
* You can cut/copy/paste elements to different apps in Studio if they have the same Mendix version
* You cannot copy/paste pages or microflows, only elements of a page or a microflow 
* You cannot cut/copy/paste from Studio to Studio Pro or vice versa
