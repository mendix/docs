## 1 Introduction

Restoring a backup locally can be useful if you want to test your cloud environment's data without interrupting your live cloud environment. In this way you can see locally how your app behaves when using data in your cloud environment. By using your Mendix Modeler and a Postgres database, you can debug your app using backups of your cloud test/acceptance/production data.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Download a backup from your cloud environment
* Create a new database
* Configure the project settings of the app
* Download and restore FileDocument (binary) objects in your Domain Model

## 2 Prerequisites

**Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:**

* [Download a backup](how-to-download-a-backup) that you want to restore locally
* Install Postgresql on your local machine by downloading and running the [Postgresql Installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/); use the program defaults and choose a password:

    {{% alert type="info" %}}You will need this password later to allow your Mendix app to access the restored data. 
    {{% /alert %}}

* When restoring a database hosted in Mendix Cloud v4, or downloading a full backup, you will need a utility such as [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) on your local machine which can extract files from **.gz** and **.tar** archives.

NOTE: This how-to has been made with Postgresql version Version 9.6.5.

## 3 Restoring the Backup to Postgres

Once Postgresql is installed and you have downloaded a backup file, you need to create a local database in Postgresql. The backup database will be restored into this local Postgresql database.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
If your backup came from Mendix Cloud v4, it will have been compressed as a .gz file. You will first have to extract the file(s) from this archive using a tool such as 7zip.

If you have downloaded a full backup, this will also have been archived as a .tar file which you need to extract to get your .backup file containing the database backup. The .backup file is in the **db** folder of the archive.
{{% /alert %}}

1. Start **pgAdmin 4** from the Windows start menu.
2. Click the **+** in the Browser pane to open the **Servers > PostgreSQL 9.6** menu.
3. Right-click **Databases** and **Create** a new database.

4. Fill in the **Database** name.
5. Select the correct owner (the default is **postgres**) and click **Save**.
6. Right-click on the newly created database and click **Restore...**.

7. Select the **.backup** file you downloaded from the Team Server.
8. Click on the **Restore options** tab.
9. Under **Do not save** set **Owner** to **Yes**.

10. Click **Restore**.
11.	Wait until you see that the backup is **Successfully completed.** in the right corner of the screen.

## 4 Linking the Database to the App in Desktop Modeler

After the backup has been restored as a local Postgres database, you have to link the database to the Desktop Modeler. This tells the Desktop Modeler to use the database that you have just created in Postgresql, rather than the database that was originally created with the app.

1. Open your app in the **Desktop Modeler**.
2. Open **Project... > Settings** from the **Project Explorer**.

3. Under the tab **Configurations** click **New**.

4. Fill in the database information:
    * **Name**: *{a unique name}*
    * **Type**: *PostreSQL*
    * **URL**: *localhost:5432*
    * **Database name**: *{database name} (the name of the database you created in pgAdmin)*
    * **User name**: *{database owner} (set when you created the database in pgAdmin; the default is postgres)*
    * **Password**: *{password for database owner} (by default the password you provided for postgres when first setting up postgressql)*

5. Click **OK**.
6. Run the app by clicking **Run Locally**.

## 5 Restoring Files

The steps above restore the database, but do not restore any **FileDocuments** (binary files, such as images).

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
You are restoring the FileDocuments to the same directory as your original local test files. Please remember to backup the files directory before adding your restored FileDocuments.
{{% /alert %}}

If you also want to restore the **FileDocuments**, you need to follow the following steps:

1. Download a **Full Snapshot**.

2. Select **Project > Show Project Directory in Explorer** from the Desktop Modeler menu

3. Navigate to the **deployment/data/files** folder within your project.
4. Extract the **{backup name}.tar** file from the .gz archive using a program like **7-zip**.
5. Extract the entire **tree** folder from the backup archive to the  **deployment/data/files** folder within your project.
6. Run the app by clicking **Run Locally**.
