## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how you can find your way in an app project in Studio Pro. At many places in Studio Pro, you can access a handy menu by clicking the right mouse button. Two options are commonly used to find your way through a project and they are called "Go to" and "Find usages." The "Go to," for example, allows you to navigate to the target of a button or to the source of data grid. The "Find Usages" option, for example, allows you to find all buttons that are opening a certain page.

## 2 "Go To" Options

1.  Select **Project** > **Navigation**.
2.  Right-click a menu item and select **Go to target**. Studio Pro now opens the corresponding target of the menu item, in this case a page.

3.  Now right-click any of the buttons in the data grid and select **Go to microflow**. Mendix Studio Pro opens the corresponding microflow.
4.  Right click any of the activities in the Microflow and select 'Go to entity'. Mendix Studio Pro now opens the corresponding domain model.

## 3 Finding Usages

1.  In the domain-model, right-click any of the entities and select **Find usages**. Mendix Studio Pro shows all the usages of this entity in the 'Find Results' pane.

3.  Now click **Lock results** in the **Find Results** pane. From this moment on, if you click 'Find Usages', the results will be shown in a second 'Find Results' pane. This allows you to continue navigating while keeping your initial search results open in the first 'Find Results' pane.
