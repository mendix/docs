**Release date: March 9th, 2017**

## 8.1

### Improvements

* We improved the performance of sprint completion. This should now take significantly less time.
* The App Store now shares the same navigation top bar, and it will therefore now be opened in the same tab.
* We made various small styling improvements.

### Fixes

* We fixed the issue in which completing a sprint from the **Stories** page wouldn't properly update the UI.
* The **getAccounts** call in the **UserManagementAPI** will now sort results consistently on **EmailAddress** when using limit/offset.
