This page has three tabs, which are described below.

On this tab, there is a Kanban overview of the [stories](../collaborate/stories) in the current sprint. 

There is also a percentage bar of the stories that are done and the deadline date of the current sprint:

You can click **Mark current sprint as completed** only when all stories have the **Done** status.

When you click **Details** for a story, you will be taken to the [Story Details](../collaborate/stories#accessing-details) page.
