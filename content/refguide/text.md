## 1 Introduction

The text widget displays a text which can contain attributes if necessary. Every attribute is replaced with the value of this attribute. For example, you can show a greeting message to a user by placing a text widget in a [data view](data-view).

If you start typing in any empty container, Studio Pro will automatically generate a text widget to display your text.

#### 2.2.1 Text Template

Text template defines the text that will be shown. The template can contain attributes that are written as a number between braces, e.g. {1}. The first attribute has number 1, the second â€“ 2, etc. To use attributes the widget must be placed in a context of an entity, e.g. inside a [data view](data-view) or a [list view](list-view).

#### 2.2.2 Parameters

For each parameter in the template you define an attribute of the context entity or a referred entity of which the value will be inserted at the position of the parameter.

#### 2.2.3 Render Mode

The render mode determines how the text will be shown in the web browser.

| --------- | ----------- |
| Text      | The text will be rendered inline with the previous/next texts on a page (`<span>` tag in HTML) |
