{{% alert color="info" %}}
MendixChat is powered by Generative AI and is currently a beta feature, introduced in Studio Pro 10.6. Surprises and mistakes are possible. For more information on beta features, see [Beta and Experimental Releases](/releasenotes/beta-features/). We would like to hear you experience with MendixChat. Please share feedback to help us improve.

MendixChat is a built-in chat interface powered by Generative AI in Studio Pro. Developers can ask questions about app development in Mendix, including how to apply concepts, best practices, and development patterns. 

MendixChat is built based on large language models (LLMs), using data from [Mendix Docs](https://docs.mendix.com/), [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/index3.html#/community), and [Mendix Academy](https://academy.mendix.com/link/home).

### 2.1 An Example of Interacting with MendixChat

You can start using MendixChat by clicking one of the demo questions. You can also start by asking your own question in the chatbox. 

The following steps present an example of how you can interact with MendixChat by asking your own question:

1. Type the following question in the chatbox: `When should I use a calculated attribute?`.
2. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the **Ask** button to send the question.

    {{% alert color="info" %}} Optionally, you can use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to add a new line to your question. {{% /alert %}}

    {{% alert color="info" %}} In Studio Pro 10.6, <kbd>Enter</kbd> can only be used to add a new line, not to send the question. You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the **Ask** button to send the question. {{% /alert %}}
    
    You will then see the following:
    * An answer generated by MendixChat
    * A copy icon ({{% icon name="copy" %}}) which allows you to copy the given answer to a clipboard (this option was added in 10.7.0)
    * Feedback icons
    * Top relevant references from various resources like Mendix documentation, Mendix Forum, and Academy learning paths

        {{% alert color="info" %}}In Studio Pro 10.7.0 and above, you can also see the Mendix version of the references, the level required if the reference comes from Mendix Academy, and the date and answer status if the reference comes from Mendix Forum.{{% /alert %}}

3. To give your feedback on the given answer, click the thumbs up icon ({{% icon name="thumbs-up" %}}) or the thumbs down icon ({{% icon name="thumbs-down" %}}). 

4. To provide a more detailed feedback, click the add feedback icon ({{% icon name="notes-paper-edit" %}}). A detailed **Feedback** section shows below the given answer:

    * You can rate the **correctness**, **completeness**, and **readability** of the provided answer.
    * You can add additional explanation text in the **Additional feedback** text box if you want to. 

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/mx-assist-studio-pro/mendix-chat/feedback-section.png" width="300px" >}} 

5. Click the **Submit feedback** button to send your feedback. Afterwards, you will be brought back to the main chat interface where you can continue asking new questions.

6. If you want to clear the messages to start a new conversation in a clean state, navigate to the top bar of MendixChat, and click the **New chat** button (this option was added in 10.7.0).

It is easy and intuitive to interact with MendixChat. Let's get started!

## 3 Limitation

You can ask questions that are related to the Mendix domain knowledge. However, only limited questions can be answered at this moment. If your question cannot be answered, you will get a default reply that asks you to provide another question. Currently, MendixChat does not support follow-up questions based on your previous ones, so please keep asking new questions.
