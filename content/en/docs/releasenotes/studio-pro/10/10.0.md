## {{PATCH_VERSION}}

### New Features

* We added a new way to convert between nanoflows and microflows by right-clicking on the microflow or nanoflow in the app explorer.

[//]: # (Include links/references to Idea Forum ideas when available.)

#### {Major new feature specifically named in heading}

### Improvements

* We have improved the export size of the model. It should now about half the size in a lot of cases. (Ticket 174121)
* We improved the naming generation in Json Structure.

* We have included support to dark-mode in the sign in dialog.

* We have updated the style for controls residing in a 'ToolBar'.
* We have updated the style for 'Button' controls.
* We have updated the image for the 'Sign-In' screens in Studio Pro.
* We have updated the style for the following UI components: 'Breadcrumb', 'Loading Bar', 'ScrollBar' and 'Tooltip'.
* We have updated the colors of the Microflow editor.

[//]: # (Include links/references to Idea Forum ideas when available.)

* We added a button to the toolbar of the workflow editor allowing the export of a workflow to an image.
* We added support to sign in using macOS external browser, it requires configuration to be done that can be found in our documentation 'Configuring Parallels -> Configuring Your Windows Virtual Machine for Mendix Studio Pro'
* We added a button to filter Performance Bot Best Practices to documents that are not yet committed to version control.
* We added default values for the `ProcessedTasksCleanupAge` and `ScheduledEventsCleanupAge` runtime settings. The default value is now 365 days for existing projects with data and 7 days for new projects or projects with empty database. Previously the default values were empty and required an explicit runtime setting configuration in order to perform cleanup.

* We updated Logic Bot when user selects a boolean Decision (at top level or in a loop) then both the True and False flows are created.
* We added F1 help support to the MLKit document, and fixed an issue with the properties pane.
* We updated Best Practice MXP011 'Avoid Deeply Nested List/Data View' to group recommendations together. There is one group for each 'stack' of deeply nested views.

* We added highlighting of the tree control rows, which are hovered over with the mouse.

#### Performance Improvements
* We improved the performance of editing published web service operations in Studio Pro. Operations that expose large data structures could cause Studio Pro to become irresponsive upon opening the edit dialog. (Ticket 179950)

#### {Major improvement specifically named in heading}

#### Other Improvements

* A single XPath query can result in multiple SQL queries to the database. If an XPath query was run outside of a transaction (so not in a microflow, but for example in a data grid), these SQL queries were executed concurrently. This is no longer the case. This simplifies debugging, logging and tracing.

* For pluggable widgets with a system property Label, **Show label** is now set to **Yes** by default.

### Fixes
* We fixed an issue in published web services where editing an operation that has a parameter and / or return type which had been removed would cause an error.
 * We fixed an issue when Studio Pro would not scroll to the element outside of the boundaries of current view in Domain Model editor when navigated via Go To actions. (Ticket 178829)
* When a database transaction for a microflow does not perform any database operation for 10 minutes, it is automatically aborted. When the same microflow then does another database operation, this used to silently start a new database transaction, losing the earlier updates. Instead, the microflow now results in an error. (Ticket 174408)
* The XPath function weekday-from-dateTime and the OQL function DATEPART(WEEKDAY, ...) now return the documented values (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday) for all supported databases. (Ticket 130641)
* We fixed the issue where for PostgreSQL and Oracle databases `DATEDIFF` function in OQL would calculate difference in calendar weeks, which was inconsistent with other databases that calculate the difference in full weeks.
* We fixed an issue where the domain-level validation message could not be translated. You can now use the `mendix.lib.Validations.field_issue` system text to translate and change it. (Tickets 180448, 181175)
* We fixed a runtime error if a microflow was no longer being used in an app after doing a hot-reload in Studio Pro.
* We fixed the issue where OQL `DATEDIFF` function in Oracle would sometimes throw an exception when calculating difference in seconds.
* We fixed an issue where the status of `ScheduledEventInformation` was `Completed` when the associated scheduled event failed.
* We adjusted Consumed OData to use query options in the request body when given service is configured to do so and pagination with @nextLink takes place. (Ticket 176976)

* The return type of the round() function with the second parameter now always returns a Decimal, even if the precision is 0.
* The ceil(), floor() and round() function with a single argument will throw an exception if the result cannot be represented as an Integer/Long (for instance due to overflow).
* We fixed an issue where the outcome selector dialog for the complete workflow user task activity would sometimes show duplicate outcomes

* We fixed an issue where it was possible to add a path after a non-object variable, which could lead to issues in the running app. (Tickets 171893, 172495)

* We fixed an issue where an application with excluded jars would fail to deploy in Studio Pro. (Ticket 181931)
* Find usages results now also include enumeration values which are used for conditional visibility. (Ticket 180727)
* We fixed an issue where creating a non-persistable entity could lead to errors when attributes were read-only.
* We fixed an issue where exporting recommendations from Performance Bot was including suppressed recommendations.
* We fixed CVE-2023-29017

### Limitations

### Deprecations
* We increased the default BCrypt cost factor from 10 to 12. A BCrypt cost factor below 12 is deprecated and will be forbidden in a future release. Use a BCrypt cost factor of at least 12.
* We removed the deprecated com.mendix.core.UseMimeDecoderForBase64 runtime setting. Base64 decoding is now always strict, as specified by RFC 4648.
* We removed the deprecated method `rollbackTransAction()` from the public `IContext` interface. Use `rollbackTransaction` instead.

### Breaking Changes
* We are more strict in the URL formats we accept at the Runtime server. We don't allow anymore empty path segments ('//' like in http://your.app//); ambiguous path segments (http://your.app/%2e%2e/path); UTF-16 encoding (http://your.app/path%u2192).

* The parseDateTime\[UTC\] microflow functions now use [strict parsing](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/DateFormat.html#setLenient(boolean)) by default. To revert to lenient parsing, set the runtime custom setting `com.mendix.core.LenientDateTimeParsing` to `true`. (Ticket 169612)
* It is no longer possible to call clear() on the list returned by the IDataTable.getRows() API function. The list returned by subList() is no longer modifiable.
* Instances of IDataTable, IDataTableSchema and IDataColumnSchame no longer provide equality; as of now equals() and hashCode() are based on object identity.
* In Mendix 9.0 we removed support for runtime uniqueness validation in preference of database uniqueness validation. There was still a custom setting to use the old behavior, this setting has now been removed.

* An XPath constraint of the form `[$objectVariable/BooleanAttribute]` where the microflow variable is not set used to be ignored and is now treated as `[false()]`.
* Duplicate column names in an OQL query are no longer allowed.
* In OQL, using a path with an association in the `ON` clause of an `OUTER JOIN` is no longer allowed.
* In OQL, comparing an attribute to a collection parameter can only be done with the `IN` or `=` operators, as in `Attribute IN $param`.
* In OQL, clauses like `Attribute = $RangeParameter`, `Attribute > RANGEBEGIN($RangeParameter)` or `Attribute < RANGEEND($RangeParameter)` with an infinite range (from `null` to `null`) used to be ignored, but are now treated as `true`.
  This makes a difference when the clause is `OR`ed with another one.  Similarly, `Attribute < RANGEBEGIN($RangeParameter)` with a range starting with `null` or `Attribute > RANGEEND($RangeParameter)`  with a range ending with `null` are no longer ignored, but treated as `false`.
* Legacy scheduled events, those that are non-repeating or have a start time, are no longer supported.
* We changed mimetype returned for js files from legacy `application/javascript` to `text/javascript`.
* We removed deprecated error constants from `AdminException`, `IMxRuntime`.
* We removed deprecated method `IActionRegistrator#bundleComponentLoaded`.
