The sort bar contains a number of sort items. Each sort item specifies what attribute to sort on and in what direction (ascending or descending). First the contents of the grid will be sorted on the first item; if two rows are the same with respect to this sort item the second item will be used etcetera. For example, if you have sort items for name and age and two people have the same name they will be sorted on their age.
