## 1 Introduction

The [Fieldset](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/113922/Mendix/Fieldset) widget is a container which groups widgets within a form. Structuring a form helps end-users fill it out, especially when they rely on accessibility tools like a screen reader. For example, you could use this widget to group input widgets that belong to the same address when a form requires multiple addresses.
