## Introduction

The [SCIM](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/229630) module facilitates integration with your IdP to create (pre-provision) selected users in your application as soon as they are created in the IdP, and deactivates them when they are removed or deactivated in the IdP.

SCIM is an abbreviation for System for Cross-domain Identity Management; a protocol that is supported by most major IdP technologies, such as Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD), Okta, Auth0, etc. For more information, see the [SCIM protocol](https://scim.cloud/).

The SCIM module allows you to integrate your app with the Joiner, Mover, Leaver (JML) process in your organization. It enables the assignment of tasks to users before their first login to the app. Additionally, based on the information in your IdP (for example, user groups), the SCIM module automatically creates and deactivates users in your app. This functionality helps you to control Mendix user licensing cost.

Before you include the SCIM module in your app, you need to check if your IdP supports SCIM protocol. If you want to integrate with an on-premises AD or similar, you may need to use the [LDAP module](/appstore/modules/ldap/) instead.
{{% /alert %}}

### Typical Use Cases

* **Seamless integration into the JML process:** Organizations need to handle employee access rights efficiently, when employees join, switch roles, or leave the organization. The Joiner, Mover, Leaver (JML) process is crucial for this, and the SCIM module helps your app integrate smoothly into these processes.

* **User onboarding before first login:** The SCIM module can be used when you want to create users in your Mendix app before their first login. For example, if your app has workflow logic, you can assign tasks to users even before their first login.

* **Use user groups to control access to your app:** Entra ID helps you organize various groups based on their jobs and roles. To manage apps access based on these groups, you can use the SCIM module. If someone changes their job or role and is no longer part of a group that allows access to the app, the SCIM module automatically deactivates the user in the app. Even if the user still has an active Entra ID account, it becomes inactive in your app. This way, you can also save on licensing costs.

* **Update local user profile:** Changes in personal details of your employees, such as email address or username modifications due to life events like marriage, are synchronized between the local user profile and Entra ID through the SCIM module.

* **B2E vs. B2C apps:** Many organizations use a common Identity Provider, such as Entra ID in Microsoft’s office 365 suit, to centralize employee accounts. If you are building apps for employees (Business-to-Employee or B2E), connecting them with Entra ID is a common and easy choice. As an app developer, you can use OIDC SSO or SAML for Single Sign-On and the SCIM module for managing users. For apps designed for customers (Business-to-Customer or B2C), the use of the SCIM module may not be as obvious. If your organization uses a third-party solution, such as Entra ID to handle customer accounts, you can also use the SCIM module for that.

### Features {#features}

Your IdP can perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations on the users in your app when it includes the SCIM module. It has the following features:

* Create users: users who are in Entra ID and assigned to the Mendix SCIM application in Azure are automatically created in the Mendix application.

* Remove users: deactivates users in the Mendix app when they are deleted from Entra ID or removed from the group of users assigned to use your app.

* The following user attributes are supported during the creation or updating of users: first name, last name, and email address.

* Update users: synchronizes changes in the user's profile in your IdP with your Mendix app, such as a change in the user’s information.

* Disable (Deactivate) / Enable (activate) users: deactivates or activates users in your Mendix app when you disable or enable them in the Entra ID.

The SCIM module also has the following features:

* It has been tested with Entra ID and Okta.
* It has been tested in combination with SAML and OIDC SSO module using Entra ID and Okta as an IdP.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}
If you are using the SCIM module in combination with Entra ID and OIDC SSO, you need to choose the correct attribute mapping. For more information, see the [Guidance on User Identifier](/appstore/modules/oidc/#guidance-user-identifier) section of the *OIDC SSO* and [Attribute Mapping](#attribute-mapping) section below.
    {{% /alert %}}

* Your IdP allows the selection of users that sync with your Mendix app, meaning your IdP controls which users are created and active in your app.
* Each application within your organization using the SCIM module must undergo separate configuration. This allows the selection of the right target group of users for each app.
* Users can be synchronized from multiple SCIM clients.

### Limitations

The SCIM module has the following limitations:

* The SCIM module does not sync groups (or group memberships) to your app. This means you cannot use the SCIM module to assign user roles to your app’s users. Instead, you can assign user roles using the features offered by [SAML SSO](/appstore/modules/saml/) or [OIDC SSO](/appstore/modules/oidc/) modules.

* If you want to do **Provision on demand** from Entra ID to test the SCIM integration of your app you cannot trigger a partial sync based on a group. This will trigger Entra ID to invoke a `/groups` endpoint, which is not yet supported.

* The module does not support the development of a SCIM client application.

### SCIM Protocol Adherence

This section provides clarity on the extent to which the SCIM module supports the SCIM protocol. It is targeted at readers who are familiar with the SCIM protocol.

* The SCIM module is based on version 2.0 of the SCIM protocol, as specified in [RFC 7642](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642), [7643](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643), and [7644](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644).

* The SCIM module is a server-side implementation of the SCIM protocol; external systems act as a SCIM clients when interacting with your app.

* The supported features align with the requirements for integration with Entra ID.

Currently, the SCIM module does not support the following features of the SCIM protocol:

* Sync password

* Enhanced group push

* Import groups

* User attributes other than a basic user profile. Mendix currently supports a limited set of user attributes from the SCIM user schema, including UserName, Email, FamilyName, GivenName, and Active status

* Multi-valued attributes

* User schema extensions

* /Me endpoint

* Bulk operations

* Multi-tenancy

### Prerequisites

1. An IdP such as Microsoft Entra ID

2. A user account in the IdP with permissions to configure provisioning (for example, application administrator, cloud application administrator, application owner, or global administrator)

### Dependencies

It is necessary to include the following Marketplace modules in your app:

* [Encryption](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1011) module – this is required to encrypt the **API key** (Token)

* [Community Commons](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/170) – see [Community Commons](/appstore/modules/community-commons-function-library/) documentation

* [User Commons](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/223053) module - Install and configure the User Commons module to support user provisioning and deactivation of user

* [Mx Model Reflection](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/69) module - Install and configure the [Mx Model Reflection](/appstore/modules/model-reflection/) module

## Configuration

### Design-time / Development Time Configuration

Import the SCIM module from the marketplace and do the following configuration:

#### Configuring Roles

Configure the **Administrator** module role to create/delete and read/write the app configuration.

The following is a typical example of how you may want to include the SCIM module’s **Module Roles** to the **User roles** of your app.

| **User Role** | **SCIM Module Role** |
| --- | --- |
| Administrator | SCIM.Administrator |

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/scim/user_roles.png" class="no-border" >}}

#### After Startup Microflow

In the **Runtime** tab, add the microflow **SCIM.ASU_StartUp** as the **After startup** microflow.

#### Navigation

The SCIM module has some configuration pages targeted at the users with local administrator app rights.
Add these pages to the **Navigation** tab and assign the **Administrator** user role.
Open [Navigation](/refguide/navigation/) tab and do the following:

* Add the **Menu** item **IdPConfiguration** to the app **Navigation**. Link this item to the **Call_IdPConfOverview** nanoflow and assign it to the **Administrator** user role.
* Add the **Menu** item **MxObjects** to the app **Navigation**. Link this item to the **MxModelReflection.MxObjects_Overview** page and assign it to the **Administrator** user role.

#### Setting Encryption Key

Set up the required configuration of the [Encryption](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1011) module as described in the [Encryption](/appstore/modules/encryption/) document. The encryption module is used to encrypt the API key (token) that a SCIM client needs to interact with the SCIM endpoint in your app.

#### Default User Provisioning

When using SCIM, Mendix recommends disabling Just-In-Time (JIT) user provisioning in your SSO module. This ensures that SCIM remains in control of user provisioning and to prevent the creation of duplicate users.

The SCIM module includes a default user provisioning microflow that maps user attributes from the SCIM payload to attributes in the common user objects within your Mendix app. For more details, see the [Attribute Mapping](#attribute-mapping) section below.

Ideally, both SCIM and SSO modules should utilize the same immutable user identifier for user identification.  This approach enables the SCIM module to modify any attribute except the principal attribute without creating a new user. However in practice, this may require attention depending on your identity provider (IdP). When you are using Entra ID, OIDC SSO, and SCIM, (see the table mentioned in the [Features](#features) section above) the default user provisioning flows may not work for you. You may need to create custom user provisioning microflows for either module.

#### Attribute Mapping {#attribute-mapping}

This section provides reference information about the attribute mapping applied by the default user provisioning flow in the SCIM module. User-identifying attributes in SCIM are compared with those in SSO modules.

If you wish to deviate from this default attribute mapping, you can create your own mapping. To do this, select an **IdP Attribute** (claim) and specify the **Configured Entity Attribute**. Ensure that the same configured entity attribute should not be mapped with another IdP attributes.

For reference, the table below gives an overview of attribute mapping when using the defaults in both Entra ID and the default microflow in the SCIM module. This information may be helpful to see where a custom user provisioning flow differs from the defaults.

| **SCIM payload** (IdP Attribute) | **Configured Entity Attribute** | **Typical value with Okta** (IdP Attribute) | **Typical value with EntraID** (IdP Attribute) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| externalID | Name | 00ctc4pufr85d7 | ObjectID (configured, non default) For example, `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` |
| familyName| lastname | Doe | Doe John |
| givenName| firstname | John |  |
| emails| Email | `john.doe@companyA.com` | `johndoe@companyA.com` |
| userName| FullName | `johndoe@companyA.com` | `johndoe@companyA.com` |
| active| Active | true | true |

{{% alert color="info" %}}
 In the SCIM protocol, you can configure the `object ID` to identify a user for Microsoft. It is used as the value for the `externalID` claim in SCIM payloads by default. That means, use the `oid` claim as user identifier to introduce SCIM. For more information, see the [Guidance on User Identifier](/appstore/modules/oidc/#guidance-user-identifier) section of the *OIDC SSO*.
{{% /alert %}}

You can configure the `objectId` in SCIM using the steps below:

1. In the Azure portal, select the application which is integrated with the SCIM module.
2. Edit the attribute mapping.
3. For `externalId`, change the **Source attribute** to `objectId`.

The table below compares the primary user-identifying attribute used by SCIM (i.e., the External ID) with the identifying claims used by SSO modules.

| **IdP** | **SSO Module** | **Remark** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Okta | OIDC SSO | SCIM.externalID and OIDC.sub contains same value. |
| EntraID | OIDC SSO | SCIM.externalID and OIDC.oid contains same value. |
| Okta | SAML | SCIM.externalID and SAML.Use Name ID contains same value. <br> Note: Configure Application username to Custom with user.getInternalProperty("id"). |
| EntraID | SAML | SCIM.externalID and SAML.Use Name ID contains same value. <br> Note: Map Unique User Identifier as user.objectid in SSO Configuration. |

### Runtime Configuration

#### API Security {#api_security}

Ensure that only legitimate SCIM clients can interact with your app via the SCIM module. You need to enable your SCIM client to authenticate itself with your app. The SCIM module currently supports usage of an **API Key** (token) for the authentication. You can either generate an API Key to download or upload one into your SCIM client during [Deploy Time Configuration](#deploy-time). This can be done by below two options:

1. Using SCIM module to generate API-key

    To generate and download an API-key, click **New** in the **IdPConfiguration** page and configure below fields:

    * **Alias**: This is an alias name for your configuration. For Example, *Azure*.

    * **API Key**: Used as a token for header-based authentication. IdP will send this as the authorization header parameter in the request.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/scim/alias.png" class="no-border" >}}

2. Configuring API-Key via Pipeline

Another option is to generate an API key yourself and submit it to the SCIM module via a SCIM constant. To do this, set the constant `SCIM.Default_APIKey_Value` in the **Acceptance Environment Details** of the Mendix application environment. This approach enables you to manage API security without requiring a local administrator to log in to your application. It provides the flexibility to use the same API key for multiple applications using the SCIM module.

#### User Provisioning

In the **Provisioning** tab of the SCIM server configuration, you need to configure the following fields:

* **Custom user Entity (extension of System.User)**: the entity in which you will store and look up the user account. If you are using the Administration module this would be `Administration.Account`.
* **The attribute where the user principal is stored** (primary attribute): unique identifier associated with an authenticated user.
* **Allow the module to create users**: this enables the module to create users based on user provisioning and attribute mapping configurations.
    * By default, the value is set to ***Yes***.
* **Default Userrole**: the role which will be assigned to newly created users by default.
* **User Type**: this allows you to configure end-users of your application as internal or external.
    * By default, the value is set to ***Internal***.
* **Attribute Mapping**: under **Attribute Mapping**, select an **IdP Attribute** (claim) for each piece of information you want to add to your custom user entity. Specify the **Configured Entity Attribute** where you want to store the information.

Note the following:

* You cannot use the IdP claim which is the primary attribute identifying the user and you cannot use the attribute you set in **The attribute where the user principal is stored**.
* You can map only one IdP claim to a **Custom user Entity** attribute.
* The **IdP Attribute** is one of the fixed claims supported by the SCIM module.
* **IdP attribute** (Claim) cannot be of type enum, autonumber, or an association.
* Use custom logic in the **User Provisioning** (Optional) – In **Custom UserProvisioning**, select a microflow you want to run for custom user provisioning.

The custom microflow name must begin with the string `UC_CustomProvisioning` and requires the following parameters:

1. **UserInfoParameter(UserCommons.UserInfoParam)**: A Mendix object containing user claims information through its associated objects. You can use this  parameter to retrieve user provisioning configuration information.
2. **User(System.User)**: A Mendix object representing the user to be provisioned. Ensure that the selected microflow matches this parameter signature.

 It will be executed after user creation or update of user. If you have added a new microflow, you need to refresh the module containing your microflow as described in the [Mx Model Reflection](/appstore/modules/model-reflection/).

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/scim/user_commons.png" class="no-border" >}}

This selection can be blank if you do not want to add custom logic. Save this configuration. Double click on **Alias** name and you will be able to copy the generated **API Key**.

### Deploy-time Configuration {#deploy-time}

Setting up connectivity with an IdP varies depending on the vendor. The following subsection shows the configuration for the Microsoft Entra ID.

#### Configuration with Entra ID

1. On the Microsoft Entra ID tenant, select **Enterprise Application** and create SCIM client in it.
2. Change the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/scim/provisioning_revised.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Configure the SCIM server (Mendix SCIM Application) with the following details:

    * **Tenant URL**: `https://{host name}/scim/v2`. Replace `{host name}` with your intranet domain. For example, `https://intranet.acme.com/scim/v2`.
    * **Secret Token**: copy the **API Key** (token) from the **IdPConfiguration** page of User Commons, as described in the [API Security](#api_security) section above.
    * Click **Test Connection**.

4. Configure **Mappings** and **Settings**.

    * **Mappings** allow you to define how data should be mapped between Entra ID and Mendix application.
    * Click **Settings** and you can change the scope to **Sync only assigned user and groups**.
    * **Save** the configuration.

5. Click **Users and groups** to add and assign the required individual users or group (or groups) of users to the SCIM Client. The scheduled provisioning will sync these users.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/scim/users_and_groups.png" class="no-border" >}}

6. On the SCIM client app, click **Provisioning** to do the user provisioning.

## Testing and Troubleshooting

Once you have your SCIM module configured, you can test it by creating, updating, and deleting the user.

### Testing with Entra ID

The test case below is defined for the scope of **Sync only assigned user and groups** and validation of provisioning status in the SCIM server.

* Create a user with default `userPrincipalName`. Optionally, you may choose to change the user Mappings in the Microsoft Entra ID. You can change Entra ID attribute from `userPrincipalName` to another attribute. For example, `mailNickName`.
* Update a user in the Microsoft Entra ID. For Example, add/update work email, last name etc.
* Delete a user in the Microsoft Entra ID.

You may want to use **Provision on demand** while testing SCIM module integration for immediate provisioning. You can either select individual users or users in a group (or groups).
Below options provide you the choice of user selection during on demand provisioning.

* **View members only**: select users from the group
* **View all users**: select users from the Entra ID

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Your app may have multiple tenants in the Entra ID. Users created from any of the Entra ID tenant will have same domain in their `user_principle_name`. This results in an active user in your app which you have not assigned in your application in Entra ID.
