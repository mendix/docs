## Introduction

With the introduction of the [Mendix Projects API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/projects-api/), you need a valid personal access token (PAT) to use the Application Test Suite (ATS).

This document guides you through the process of configuring your Mendix PAT in ATS.


## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed the following:

* Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) by following the instructions in [Generating a PAT](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pipelines-api/#generate).

## Setting Up Your PAT key in ATS

1. Log in to ATS.

2. Click your profile on the upper-right corner:

3. From the drop-down menu, select **Account Settings**.

   In the **Account Settings** page, you can see a section for your PAT. If you have not set up a PAT yet, the dialog box shows **Personal access token is not configured yet.**

You have successfully set up your Personal Access Token in ATS. This allows you to access and use the full functionality of ATS.
