## 1 Introduction

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow.

There are different types of activity, and they are grouped together in the Studio Pro **Toolbox**. All the activities are listed below. Click on each activity for more details.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most activities can be used in both microflows and nanoflows. However, some can only be used in one of these types of flow, or the behavior may differ between in microflows and in nanoflows.

## 2 Object Activities

Object activities can be used to create and manipulate objects. The [domain model](/refguide/domain-model/) defines the object types ([entities](/refguide/entities/)) that can be used.
