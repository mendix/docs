## 1 Introduction

This how-to is helping you to build a to-do app based on the new sample Mobile Quick Starter App. This new sample app was introduced in Mendix 7.2 and helps you to quickly and easily build rich mobile apps with a native look and feel, and include best practices.

The sample app is equiped with new widgets, preconfigured modules, best practices, and an example inspection module to kickstart your mobile development by default.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a project that will speed up and simplify your mobile app development
* Build a to-do app
* Configure several widgets to realize a rich mobile app with a native look and feel

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Switching the security level to *Off* is done for fast development. Make sure you change it back to *Production* and configure the security of your app when you are going to use the app in a production environment.
</div>

## 4 Create a New Module
The to-do app will use a separate module, so you can keep all the to-do app documents in one location. Follow these steps to create a new module:

1. Right-click your **ProjectName** in the Project Explorer.
2. Click **Add module** and give it the name **ToDo**.

## 5 Create the Domain Model
The domain for the to-do app is pretty simple. It contains one entity with some attributes. Follow these steps to create the entity and attributes:

1. Open the **Domain Model** in the **ToDo** module.
2. Add a new **Entity** to the Domain Model.
2. Rename the entity to **ToDo***.
3. Add the following three attributes:
  * *Description* (String)
  * *DueDate* (Date and time)
  * *Completed* (Boolean with default value *False*)

## 6 Create the Pages
In this chapter you will create the Homepage and NewEdit pages to create and adjust to-do's.

### 6.1 Create the Home Page
The app will use the home page as the landing page when users open the to-do app. It contains a list of their to-do's. Follow these steps to create the home page:

1. Right click your newly created ToDo module and select **Add > Page**.
2. Go to the **Phone Specific** tab and click **Yes** when you're asked to create a new Phone Profile.
3. Name the page **Home_Phone_Default**.
4. Select *Phone_HeaderOnly* as **Navigation layout**.
5. Click **Blank** on the left side and select the *Blank* page template.
6. Click **OK** to create the page.
7. Open your project's **Navigation** and set the **Home_Phone_Default page** in the ToDo module as default home page.

### 6.2 Configure the Home Page
Let's add some content to the home page so it can show a list of to-do's. Follow these steps to add a list view to the home page:

1. Change the page title to **My to-do's** in the **Properties** pane on the right side of the Modeler.
2. Remove the **Layout grid** from the page.
3. Add a **List view** to the page.
4. Right-click the **List view** and select **Select data soure**.
5. Click **Select** and select the **ToDo** entity for the **Entity (path)**.
6. Click **OK** and then **Yes** to automatically fill the content of the list view.
7. Remove the **Completed** attribute.
8. Double-click the **Sort order: (default)** and add the **DueDate** attribute with the **Ascending** sort direction.

You can now see a list of to-do's on your home page. Let's configure a page to create to-do's.

### 6.4 Create and Configure the New and Edit Page
Users also need to be able to add new to-do's to the list, that's why you're going to add a page that lets them do this. Follow these steps to create a new and edit page:

1. Add a **Create button** to the **HeaderRight** placeholder on the page.
2. Select the **ToDo** entity in the pop-up.
3. Right-click the **New** button and select **Generate page**.
4. Select **Form default** and click **OK**.
5. Right-click the **New** button and select **Go to page**.
6. Delete the **Completed** attribute.

## 7 Improve the Mobile Look and Feel
The following steps improve the mobile look and feel by adding and configuring widgets in your project.

### 7.1 Enhance the Home Page
Follow these steps to improve the look and feel of the home page:

1. Go back to the **Modeler**.
2. Open the **Home_Phone_Default** of the *ToDo* module.
3. Open the properties of the **Description** attribute and change the following settings:
  * On the **General** tab, set **Show label** to **No**
  * On the **Common** tab, add the **text-bold** class.
4. Open the properties of the **DueDate** attribute and change the following settings:
  * Select **Custom** for **Date format**, and set the custom format to **dd-MMM-yyyy**.
  * Set **Show label** to **No**

9. Open the properties of **New** button in the top-right corner of the page.
10. Change the following properties:
  * Check **Override page title** and change the title to **Create to do**
  * Use the **plus** icon for the **Icon** option
  * Select **Link** for the **Render mode**

The containers in the snippet have the same name as the text in it. You can add your own containers with different text, but make sure you set the correct names of the containers in the widget.
4. Add a **Container** below the **ListViewSwipe_MarkAsCompleted** snippet and within the **Todo list view**.
5. Change the name of the container to **Buttons**.

## 8 Adding Logic to the Microflows
The **List view swipe** widget has been configured, but you added two microflows that do not have any logic yet. Follow these steps to add some logic and make them execute the behavior we want when they are triggered:

1. Open the **ACT_ToDo_Delete** microflow.
2. Add an **Activity** that deletes the **ToDo** object and refreshes the client.

3. Open the **ACT_ToDo_MarkAsCompleted** microlfow.
4. Add an **Activity** that changes the **Completed** attributed of the **ToDo** object to *true* and set **Commit** to *Yes*.

<div class="alert alert-info">
There is no need to refresh in the client due to the *Move out, hide* behavior of the List view swipe widget.
</div>
