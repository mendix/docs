## 1 Introduction

Your Mendix Profile is your main point of contact with members of the Mendix community. It displays your activities on the Mendix Platform and details about your background. 
To get more involved in the Mendix community, your profile is the best way to start. 

You can access your Mendix profile by clicking your picture in the upper-right corner of the Developer Portal and then selecting **See Your Profile**.

## 2 Header {#header}

Your profile header displays a quick overview of information about you. Your Mendix experience in level and points, your number of [credits](#challenges), and your number of [connections](#connections) are all found here. You can also select up to four featured [badges](#badges) to display your progress on the Mendix Platform. If you have a certificate from the Mendix [Academy](https://academy.mendix.com), this will also be displayed. The **Personal Info** card presents other information.

You can change these details in the [Settings](#settings).

## 3 Overview & Stats

Your profile opens to the **Overview** tab, which shows you at a quick glance how you are doing on the platform. You can see the following:

* Stats 
* Badges in progress and the next badges to work towards
* Assigned challenge
* Personal information
* Invitations
* Position on the leaderboard
* Portfolio

The first profile card below the header presents your **Stats**, which are your points divided between Mendix products and activities:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/stats.png"   width="350"  >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Don't get bummed out about a low number of points, because everyone in the Mendix community started like that, even our Expert developers! There are plenty of opportunities to gain more points and climb the [Leaderboard](#leaderboard).
{{% /alert %}}

## 4 Badges {#badges}

In addition to the **Stats** chart, on the **Overview** tab you gain an overview of your **Badges**. These badges represent your achievements and progress on the Mendix Platform. You can see your **Badges in Progress** as well as **Next Badges**. The badges are color-coded based from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare).

To see all your badges as well as the badges you can work towards, click **View all** to go to the **Badges** tab of your profile. On that tab, you can select up to four badges from the **Earned badges** section to make visible in your profile [header](#header) by clicking **Select as featured**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the **Earned badges** section, you find the badges you have completed. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown.
{{% /alert %}}

The percentage on the card of the **Badges in progress** shows how far you have come to earn that particular badge. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown, so don't get distracted while earning it!

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/badges.png"   width="350"  >}}

## 5 Challenges {#challenges}

The **Challenge** card presents a featured challenge you can complete to gain credits. You can use the credits in the [Mendix Shop](https://shop.mendix.com) to order low-code t-shirts or other Mendix swag. Some challenges are going to be easy for you, whilst others might be harder to complete!

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/challenges.png"   width="350"  >}}

Click **View All** to go to the **Challenges** tab of your profile. This tab presents more details on the challenge steps, the time left, and how many credits you can earn with them. You can complete these activities in any order you like.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/credits.png"   width="350"  >}}

When you complete a challenge, click **Claim Credits** to claim the Mendix credits. You can then spend your credits on cool items in the Mendix Shop.

## 6 Connections {#connections}

One of the greatest strengths of Mendix is our awesome developers community, and the **Connections** card is the perfect place to start connecting to other Mendix developers. When you get an invitation to connect, you can check out their profile and decide whether to accept or ignore it. 

You can also see a list of people you may know so that you can add further connections to your profile. To connect with someone, click the plus icon to send an invitation.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/connections.png"   width="350"  >}}

Clicking **View All** on the card will bring you to the **Connections** tab of your profile. On this tab, you can invite friends and colleagues to Mendix in two ways:

* **Share URL** – copy the personalized invite link and share it directly
* **Send Invite** – send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/referral.png"   width="500"  >}}

## 7 Leaderboard {#leaderboard}

This card on your profile presents your points and ranking for the last 30 days:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/leaderboard.png" >}}

Clicking **View All** takes you to the **Leaderboards** page, where you can view leaders per category, for the whole Mendix Platform, or for your company only.

You can climb the leaderboard by earning points through various activities on the Mendix Platform. For example, let's say you have some time to spare while your app is deploying. You get a cup of coffee and check out the [Mendix Forum]. One questions pops out because you came across a similar problem a few weeks back.

You can edit the information on your Mendix Profile by clicking the **Settings** cog icon. The settings page has a sidebar menu that allows you to edit the sections described below.

### 10.1 General Information

In this section, you can upload your profile image and fill in your personal details

You can change your password in this section. By default, you are requested to change your password every 90 days. Only a [Mendix Admin](/developerportal/control-center/#security) can change this.

### 10.5 API Keys {#api-key}

In this section, you can create and view the API keys that external applications can use to connect via the [Mendix Platform APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/) on behalf of your user account. An API key created here allow apps using it to act on behalf of the user who created the key, which means the apps will have the same privileges as the user who created the key. An API key allows you to execute operations that need authentication without a password.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Some platform APIs use *Personal Access Tokens (PATs)* rather than *API Keys*. For more information on PATs, and how to generate and manage them, see [Create a Personal Access Token with Warden](/developerportal/community-tools/warden/).
{{% /alert %}}

For example, you can use an API key to perform scripted operations on your application model with the SDK. 

To get a Mendix API key, click **Create New API Key** and follow the instructions.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Make a note of the API key, as it will only be shown once. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/api-key.png" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
We may cache your API key. This means that when you revoke an API key, it may take some time before the change takes effect.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information, see the following:

* [Authentication](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/authentication/)
* [APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/)
* [Mendix Platform SDK](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/)

#### 10.7.1 Merging Your Accounts {#merging}

With use of the Mendix Profile, you can merge your old Mendix account(s) into your current Mendix account. This action combines all your points, certifications, and achievements to support you as you clim the leaderboards or on your way to the Expert certification.

Before merging, make sure your profile is public and that you logged in with the right email address. Enter the email address you want to have merged into the logged-in account, then send the merge request.

We’ll take things from there!

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Once the old account has been merged into the new account, you no longer have access to the apps of your old account. With your new account, you will need a new invitation to those apps to gain access. Adding your new account to the relevant apps before the merge is recommended.{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
With the merge, the accounts are only combined. The old account is not deactivated from the Mendix Platform. That should be done by a [Mendix Admin](/developerportal/control-center/#members).
{{% /alert %}}
