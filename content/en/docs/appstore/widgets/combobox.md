## 1 Introduction

The [Combo Box](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/219304) widget displays a list of options that users can select from. This is useful in scenarios where end-users need to filter their data through choices, such as being able to select or de-select different countries from a list.

A typical combo box can look like this:
