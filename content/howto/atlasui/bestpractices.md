## 1.1 Preparing a Mendix Project with Atlas UI

### Sprinting with Atlas UI

Atlas UI lets you optimize the User Experience of your applications while accelerating your development workflow. For the best results, it’s important to embed Atlas UI in your development process. To make things easy, we’ve mapped out how to tackle your ﬁrst project with Atlas UI, from the preparation phase, all the way to that ﬁnal sprint.


### Save Time by Preparing

The Project Preparation stage is the time to explore Atlas UI and save yourself time down the road. In following the preparation steps, the impact of Atlas UI on your workflow is minimal, yet you still get the User Experience quality peak.

1. Figure out the type of pages you will need

*Learn from others*
Look at similar applications for inspiration - what solutions do they use to solve the same problems? Look at the Mendix showcase applications and see what can be created Browse through example pages and page templates

*Look for shortcuts*
There’s no need to reinvent the wheel when you’re making your app. In fact, using patterns that users are familiar with will make it easier for them to interact with your app. Browse through the example pages and page templates in search of pages that most resemble design assets.

2. Choose your building blocks

Sometimes, page templates by themselves aren’t enough to realize that beautiful app you’re trying to create. Fortunately, with Atlas UI you don’t have to create pages from scratch. Just drag and drop large blocks of UI functionality into your pages. Browse through the building blocks to find which ones will enhance your app.

3. Consolidate your findings

Now that you’ve selected a collection of both page templates and building blocks, it’s time to consolidate them into a useful list for the rest of your team.

### Your First Sprint

The ﬁrst sprint is a great opportunity to ‘get your hands dirty’ with Atlas UI, saving a lot of time and eﬀort further down the road.

If you’ve joined your project in the ﬁrst sprint, it might be good to check if there already is a consolidated list of page templates and building blocks. If not, creating one would be the ﬁrst step in your project.

1. Create a new web modeler-enabled project in the web modeler.

2. Create your ﬁrst pages in the modeler, making sure that you create as many of the diﬀerent types as possible.

3. If needed: create a folder or module that contains all the page templates and building blocks.

4. Don’t forget to inspect all the default pages that have been created or added via modules. Aligning those with the existing pages will drastically improve the the applications consistency.
As both the web modeler and Atlas UI are in Beta, not everything from the pages and building blocks is available in the desktop version. Hence it might be a good idea to create a folder or module that has all the page templates and building blocks used in the project. That way, team members that are working in the desktop modeler can still ‘copy paste’ and use page templates and building blocks.

#### Tip

*Be minimalistic:* use as few different types of page templates and building blocks as possible.

*Be consistent:* always use the same kind of solution for the same kind of problem.

*Be transparent:* hang a list of your page templates and building blocks on the wall of your war-room, or include it in your project. Adding screenshots to your user stories is a great way to do this.

### Progressing Through Sprints

In an agile setting, everything you do is subject to change. This is true with Atlas UI as well. To help you on your way we’ve listed the most common occurrences and added an approach on how to deal with them.

#### The functionality of that new page you’re creating is too complex for your chosen set of page templates.

Search for an better suited template and if present, add it to the app.
*if not*
Pick a page template that is almost what you need, and enrich it with building blocks.
*or*
Build a page from scratch using building blocks. Make sure to keep the structure of that page easily accessible for other new pages with the same template.

#### One of your chosen page templates needs to be changed to another.

Keep your existing pages and alter them to look and behave like the new pages would.
*or*
Create a new page and copy and paste the needed component from your existing pages.

#### A new functionality “block” is needed that is not present in your chosen set of building blocks.

Search for a new suitable building block and if present, add it to the app.
*if not*
Pick a building block that is “halfway” to what you need and alter it with widgets.
*or*
Create your own building block from scratch.

#### One of the used building blocks needs to be changed to another building block.

Add the new building block to the page.
*and either*
Copy and paste the needed components from the original building block to the new one.
*or*
Manually alter the new building block.
*after which*
The original building block can be removed.

#### Adding the cherry on top: Customizing the branding of your application.

Open up the theme creator section in the web modeler. Adjust some of the main settings such as logo, brand colors and typography.

## 1.2 Using the Atlas UI App While You Work
The Atlas UI mobile app enables you to browse through all the page templates, building blocks and widgets on your mobile phone. Explore Atlas UI solutions wherever you are. You can even use it while modeling so you don’t have to keep navigating back to your browser.
