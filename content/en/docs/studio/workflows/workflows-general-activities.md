## 1 Introduction

**General** activities allow you to manage paths in your workflow. A **Decision** allows you to add a condition and the workflow will follow one of the paths depending on this condition. With the help of the **Jump** activity you can jump to another activity in the workflow. **Parallel Split** adds several parallel paths (processes) to the workflow, and the **End** event ends a path.

## 2 Decision {#decision}

A decision is an element that makes a choice based on a condition and follows one and only one of the outgoing paths. For example, you can use it to follow different processes when a new hire works remotely or when they work from the office:

### 2.1 Decision Properties

An example of decision properties is represented in the image below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/workflows/workflows-general-activities/decision-properties.jpg" alt="Decision Properties" >}}

Decision properties consist of the following sections:

* [General](#general)
* [Outcome](#outcome)

#### 2.1.1 General Section {#general}

The **General** section provides the caption for the element and its condition.

The **General** section properties are described in the table below:

| Property  | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Caption   | Describes what happens in this element. It is displayed in the workflow editor to make the workflow easier to read and understand. |
| Condition | **Condition** is configured based on an [expression](/refguide/expressions/). The expression should result in a Boolean or an enumeration.<br />For the expression resulting in a Boolean, two paths are possible: **true** and **false**. For example, you can use the expression resulting in a Boolean to follow different processes whether a new employee is working from home or from the office (and either send their devices to the home address or set up a workstation in the office).<br /> |

#### 2.1.2 Outcomes Section {#outcome}

**Outcomes** depends on the condition of the decision. For example, for the Boolean, you have **true** and **false** outcomes, and for the enumeration: an outcome per each enumeration value and an empty one when the value is unassigned.  

To change the order of outcomes, click the **Outcome** property and drag it. 

## 3 Jump Activity {#jump}

The **Jump** activity allows you to jump to other activities in the workflow. This is useful when, for example, you are approving a request and need more details that are provided in one of the previous user tasks:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/workflows/workflows-general-activities/jump-example.jpg" alt="Jump Activity Example" >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
You cannot use the **Jump** activity in a Parallel split or in a path where it would end the workflow without any other path continuing it. 
{{% /alert %}}

### 3.1 Jump Activity Properties

An example of Jump activity properties is represented in the image below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/workflows/workflows-general-activities/jump-properties.jpg" >}}

The Jump activity properties consist of the **General** section and are described in the table below:

| Property | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name     | The internal name of the element. When referring to the element in the  you will use this name. It must be unique. |
| Caption  | Describes what happens in this element. It is displayed in the workflow editor to make the workflow easier to read and understand. |
| Target   | **Target** is the activity the **Jump** goes to. You can select the activity you would like to go to from the drop-down menu. |

## 4 Parallel Split {#parallel-split}

The parallel split is used to have parallel processes in your workflow. For example, when onboarding a new employee, you can have several processes running in parallel: the HR department preparing necessary documents, the IT department preparing a workstation, and the Administration department scheduling a training for the employee:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/workflows/workflows-general-activities/parallel-split-example.jpg" alt="Parallel Split Example" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

The workflow will only continue to the next activity when all paths of the parallel split have been completed.

{{% /alert %}}

### 4.1 Parallel Split Properties

An example of parallel split properties is represented in the image below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/workflows/workflows-general-activities/parallel-split-properties.jpg" alt="Parallel Split Properties" >}}

Parallel split properties consist of the following sections:

* [General](#general)
* [Paths](#paths)

#### 4.1.1 General Section {#general}

The **Caption** describes what happens in this element. It is displayed in the workflow element to make the workflow easier to read and understand.

#### 4.1.2 Paths Section {#paths}

The **Paths** property allows you to add as many paths as there are parallel processes. 

To change the order of paths, click the **Paths** property and drag it.

## 5 End Event {#end}

The **End** event ends the path of the workflow. 

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
You cannot use the **End** event in a Parallel split or in a path where it would end the workflow without any other path continuing it. 
{{% /alert %}}
