## 1 Introduction

This document describes the role of the Technical Contact within the Mendix Cloud.

The Technical Contact is responsible for license renewal and is the first point of contact for the Mendix Support department. A Mendix application will always be set up and delivered with a Technical Contact assigned to it. The Technical Contact needs an MxID before Mendix can activate a license for an application.

It is currently not possible to select more than one Technical Contact in the Mendix Cloud. However, for on-premises installations, it is possible to select more than one Technical Contact. Contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com) with your request.

## 2 Technical Contact Responsibilities

The responsibilities depend on whether you are hosting your app in the Mendix Cloud or on premises.

### 2.1 Mendix Cloud

For apps in the Mendix Cloud, the Technical Contact is the first point of contact for the app. In this scenario, the Technical Contact does the following:

* Receives notifications for upcoming maintenance operations on the application
* Can receive alerts from the Mendix app when problems arise (for example, CPU load is high, running out of disk space)
* Can configure the alert settings in the **Monitoring** tab of the cloud node

As a Technical Contact, you can perform all the regular operations on the Mendix Cloud node in the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com). Additionally, you can manage the access rights of your team members so that they can deploy, stop and start the app, and perform other actions. For more information, see [Security & Node Permissions](/developerportal/settings/node-permissions).

These are some details about managing licenses (renewals, activation, and upgrades):

* Mendix is responsible for Mendix Cloud app renewals
* Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) if you want to expand the license

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes, and incidents.

### 2.2 On-Premises

When a Mendix app is on premises, it is running on the customer's own infrastructure.

These are some details about managing licenses (renewals, activation, and upgrades):

* Mendix sends license renewal notifications to the Technical Contact via email
* As a Technical Contact, if you want to expand the license (for example, for more users), you need to contact your Account Executive

You can submit requests in the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes, and incidents.
