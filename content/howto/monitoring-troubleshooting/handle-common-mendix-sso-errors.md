## 2 "404 Not Found" Errors When Navigating to `/openid/login`

A frequent cause of "404 not found" errors when navigating to `/openid/login` is that the OpenID request handler is not enabled. It should be enabled on startup.

To fix this, make sure the **AppCloudServices.StartAppCloudServices** microflow is executed during the startup of your application. You can do this by setting it as the app's after-startup microflow or by having the application's existing after-startup microflow trigger it.

## 3 Realm Verification Errors

These are commonly caused by compatibility issues with JAR files in the `<projectpath>/userlib` directory of your project. For details on the most common compatibility issues, refer to [Troubleshooting](/refguide7/troubleshooting) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
