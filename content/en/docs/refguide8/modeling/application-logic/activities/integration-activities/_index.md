When working with external services there are several microflow activities which enable you to call the service and perform mapping operations.

The activities described in this document are in the **Integration Activities** section of the **Toolbox**:

The following are the list activities you can use in your microflow:

* [Call REST Service](/refguide8/call-rest-action/) – calls a REST endpoint
* [Call Web Service](/refguide8/call-web-service-action/) – calls an imported web service operation
* [Import Mapping](/refguide8/import-mapping-action/) – imports data from an XML or JSON document into objects
* [Export Mapping](/refguide8/export-mapping-action/) – exports data from objects into XML or JSON documents, or a string variable
