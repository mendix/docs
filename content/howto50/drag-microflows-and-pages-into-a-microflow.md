Coming home with sore hands from using the mouse too much during the day is very uncomfortable. Therefore this how-to will teach you how to use the mouse more efficiently while modeling a Mendix app.Â 

## 1\. Generating a sub microflow from selected actions

If it is possible, re-using logic is an important procedure while developing apps. The actions that form the reusable logic can be selected and turned into a sub microflow. This just takes two clicks as the following animation shows:
