A menu document defines a navigation menu that can be used by a [menu widget](menu-widgets). Typically the main menus for your application are defined in [device types](desktop-profile), while you use menu documents for auxiliary menus, e.g. a side bar.

A menu consists of a list of menu items, which optionally contain sub-items. Depending on the widget a number of levels are allowed.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

If [security](project-security) is enabled, the menu will only show items that the user has access to.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>
