## 1 Introduction

The [Progress Bar](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/48910/) widget displays a progress bar.

### 1.1 Features

* Show percentage of progress based on value
* Render bar types: plain, striped, or animated stripes
* Use bar Bootstrap colors: success, info, warning, or danger

### 1.2 Demo App Project

For a demo app project that has been deployed with this widget, see [here](https://progressbar-demo.mxapps.io/).

## 2 Usage

Place the widget in the context of an object that has attributes for **Progress attribute** and **Maximum value attribute**:
* If **Progress attribute** is not set, **Value static** will be used to calculate the progress
* If **Maximum value attribute** is not set, the maximum value defaults to **Maximum value static**

Progress percentage is calculated via `(value / maximumValue) * 100`.

Depending on the specified Bootstrap style (primary, success, info, warning, danger), the progress bar can appear in the associated colors.

For negative progress values, the bar is drawn from right to left.

## 3 Developing This App Store Component
