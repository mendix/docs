## 1 Introduction

At Mendix World on September 8th, 2021, the keynote from Mendix CTO Johan den Haan announced a number of features which Mendix is releasing. Many of these are available immediately, but some are planned for future release in the months following Mendix World 2021. This document contains the calendar of expected release dates for these features.

Johan divided the new features into these major announcements, which are described in the sections below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/releasenotes/mx-world-2021/innovations.png" alt="Announcements are solutions platform, app services framework, end-user services and studio, control center, next-level front-end, page bot and machine learning toolkit, studio pro experience, data hub 2.0, intelligent automation, and hybrid cloud automation." >}}

"GA" means General Availability for all users. A GA release is different than a Beta release. For more information on Private Beta and Public Beta releases, see [Beta Releases](/releasenotes/beta-features/).
