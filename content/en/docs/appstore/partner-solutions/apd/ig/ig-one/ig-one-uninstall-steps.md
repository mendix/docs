## 1 Introduction

This chapter describes the uninstallation of the APM tool. The optional in this chapter means you need to verify if this option was chosen during the install before undoing it.

## 2 Backup

Did you commit your work to the team server? And did you make a database backup?

At this step, either make a local copy of the widgets folder in your app or have a third party version control client installed such as TortoiseGit. You can use this to revert accidental changes in the next step.

## 3 Delete Module APMAgent

Import the module APMAgent in the modeler.

* ManTooltip.mpk
* StringFormatter.mpk
* CssSelectorHelperBoolean.mpk
* StyleSheetSwap.mpk

## 7 Optional: Revert After Startup and Before Shutdown

Remove the microflow call action to APMAgent\USE_ME\AfterStartup from an after startup microflow. This feature is runtime configurable and by default none of the tools are started.
Remove the microflow call action to APMAgent\USE_ME\BeforeShutdown from a before shutdown microflow.
You can find the AfterStartup and BeforeShutdown microflows in the project settings.

* apm

* com.mendix.postgresql.jdbc4.jar
