### 2.1 Leave the App with team members

You can only leave the app when you are NOT the **Technical Contact**. 
After leaving, the app will still exist in the company and it will be available for other team members.
If you want to return to the app team, other team members can add you again by inviting you to the app.

### 2.2 Leave the App without team members

You can leave the app if you are the only team member of the app and still keep the app in the company. This way the app will be deactivated.
Because the app will still exist within the company, only the **Company Admin** can activate the app and invite members to it.

To leave and deactivate the app, click **Continue**

To leave and delete the app, click **Continue and delete app**.
