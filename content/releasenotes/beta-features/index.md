---

## 1 Beta Features Overview

Some Mendix Platform releases contain beta features. We release these beta features to collect feedback on their implementation so that we can improve them. We value any feedback on these beta features, as it enables us to provide you with the best possible product.

The availability of beta features will be documented in the release notes for every specific release. Other documentation will be available through the Mendix documentation website. Please consult the release notes and the documentation on how to enable and use these beta features.

Beta features are part of regular Mendix releases. By default they are disabled. Please consult the documentation to learn how to enable and use beta features.

## 2 Limitations of Beta Features

Please take note of the following limitations regarding beta features:

* Beta features may be incomplete; future releases may include more functionality to complete the feature
* Beta features may change in future releases, depending on the feedback
    * Even though we aim for backwards compatibility, Mendix can not guarantee backwards compatibility between monthly releases for beta features.
* Beta features are not covered by any SLA
    * We value feedback, including tickets describing problems with beta features, but these tickets will not be handled according to your SLA
    * We cannot guarantee timely fixes for any problems you encounter with beta features
* Beta features should not be used for production applications
    * We do not offer production support on beta features
    * Beta features may contain bugs, which could potentially lead to data corruption
