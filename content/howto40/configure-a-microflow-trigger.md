 **By right-clicking on the microflow trigger and choosing 'Edit microflow settings...' or clicking on '...' next to 'On click settings' in the Properties window, you can bring up a menu in which you can configure which objects should be passed to the microflow when the microflow trigger is clicked. Using this menu it is also possible to configure behavior in the case of validation errors, whether or not to show a progress bar for the microflow, and if the client should wait for the microflow to finish. Additionally you can use the Properties window to change the appearance and caption of the microflow trigger.**
