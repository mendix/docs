Images can be used to brighten up your application. Navigation items and the various kinds of buttons have small images (icons) to left of their captions. Images can also be used in the image viewer widgets in [Pages](pages) and [Document Templates](document-templates). Finally, [enumeration values](enumeration-values) can have images that can then be shown in data grid columns.

The System module contains some images that are used by the standard components. If you place a data view on a form, the Save and Cancel buttons will have images from the System module on them. You can always use different images if you like. The same holds for images on the control bar buttons of the data grid.

## Supported Formats

The following image formats are supported: png, gif, jpeg, bmp. PNG is recommended; it is compressed without losing any information and supports transparancy very well.
