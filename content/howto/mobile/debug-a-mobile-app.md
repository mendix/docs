## 1 Introduction

Mendix has great tools for debugging web applications, including the offline and online debugger, but a lot of people don’t know that these tools can also be used to debug and test mobile applications.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Build and run a Mendix mobile app that connects to your local development machine
* Debug the mobile app using Mendix debugging tools, Chrome DevTools and the Safari Web Inspector

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Ensure that you have a network utilities tool on your mobiledevice (I use [PingTools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ua.com.streamsoft.pingtools) on Android, and [NetworkPing Lite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/network-ping-lite/id289967115?mt=8) on iOS) in order to ensure connectivity between your device andyour computer
* Ensure that you have an Adobe ID that you can use to sign in to PhoneGap Build ([https://build.phonegap.com/apps](https://build.phonegap.com/apps))
* You need a paid Apple Developer Membership - see [Apple Membership](https://developer.apple.com/support/membership/) for more details

## 3 Mendix and PhoneGap <a name="MendixAndPhonegap"></a>

Before we begin, it’s important to understand how Mendix Hybrid Mobile apps work, and the relationship between the Mendix application and the PhoneGap service. [Adobe PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/) provides a way for users to create mobile applications using web technologies, like Mendix. PhoneGap (PG) essentially creates a wrapper for a Mendix application that is recognized and treated like a native application by mobile platforms. All your application’s logic, appearance, and functionality are controlled by Mendix. PhoneGap then, in a way, *translates* these aspects of your application into a language that can be understood by Android and iOS. That being said, there are some facets of your application’s configuration that need to be configured in the PhoneGap application and not in Mendix. We’ll return to this a little later.

The basic function of the PhoneGap app is to ensure that all the necessary libraries (called PhoneGap Plugins) are loaded and available to the application, and then initialize the Mendix application from a target URL. As soon as the Mendix app has been initialized, the app’s Mendix logic then takes over. There are a couple of benefits that we, as Mendix developers, gain from the fact that the PhoneGap app initializes based on a URL: One, changes that we make to the application logic do not require a full rebuild of both the Mendix app and the PhoneGap app (just the Mendix one); and two, that we can instruct the PhoneGap app to initialize based on an IP address (rather than the production URL) and debug a mobile application running locally on our laptop, in order to further increase the speed of our iterations.

## 4 Android and macOS <a name="AndroidMac"></a>

This is perhaps the easiest combination of mobile target platform and development environment to get to work. 

### 4.1 macOS Configuration

Since the Mendix Modeler only runs on Mendix, we need to make sure that your virtual (windows) machine can be accessed by the outsideworld. To do that, the network setting much be shared between the virtual machine and your Mac, and the appropriate ports forwarded. Follow these steps to configure your development environment with Parallels:

1. Open the Parallels **Configure** dialog.

      ![mac-1](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/mac-1.png)
      
2. Go to the **Hardware** tab.

      ![mac-1b](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/mac-1b.png)

3. Make sure that the **Source** for **Network 1** is set to **Shared Network**. Click the lock to make changes.

4. Open the Parallels **Preferences** dialog.
      
      ![mac-3](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/mac-3-1163108.png)

5. Go to the **Network** tab.
6. Make sure that the **Connect Mac to this network** option is checked.

      ![mac-3b](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/mac-3b-1163119.png) |

7. Click **+** button at the bottom of the page to add a new Port Forwarding Rule with the following settings:
      * Protocol: *TCP*
      * Source Port: *8080*
      * Forward to: *Win10*
      * Destination Port: *8080*
      
      ![mac-4](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/mac-4-1163092.png)
      
8. Add another rule, this time forwarding port *8090*.

9. Start the Mendix app locally, and verify that your mobile device can ping your development machine.

10. Find the local IP of your development machine on your network by going to **settings > network**.

      ![mac-6](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/mac-6-1163082.png)

11. Verify that your device can ping this address:

      ![win-2](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/win-2.png)

### 4.2 PhoneGap Configuration

You can use PhoneGap Build to build the native application and tell it to intialize based on this new URL, rather than the default. Follow these steps to download a package, update it, and upload it to PhoneGap Build: 

1. Go to home.mendix.com and open your app.
2. Go to the **Mobile App** page.
2. Configure this page as you normally would and then click **Publish for Mobile App Stores**.
      
      ![phonegap-1](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/phonegap-1.png)

3. Select **Do it Yourself** and then click **Download Customizable Package**.
      
      ![phonegap-3](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/phonegap-3.png)

4. Extract the downloaded package and then navigate to the `/dist/` folder.
      
      ![phonegap-4](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/phonegap-4.png)

5. Extract the contents of the **phonegap.zip** file and open the `www/settings.json` file.
      
      ![phonegap-5](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/phonegap-5.png)

6. Change the `url` property to the IP address of your local machine, with the port 8080.

   ```javascript
   {
     "url": "http://10.140.149.92:8080",
     "hybridTabletProfile": "",
     "hybridPhoneProfile":  "",
     "enableOffline": false,
     "requirePin": false
   }
   ```

7. Save your changes and zip the unzipped phonegap.zip files you just extracted.
   
      ![phonegap-7](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/phonegap-7.png)

8. Upload the new zip file to a new app on PhoneGap Build.
   
      ![phonegap-8](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/phonegap-8.png)

9. When your app has finished building in the cloud, download it and run it to connect to your Mendix app running on your local machine.

### 4.3 Android Configuration

1. Enable the developer options on your Android device. See [Configure On-Device Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html#enable) for more information.
2. Connect your device to your development machine and when the popup appears on your mobile device to allow USB debugging, choose **Allow**.
      
      ![android-2](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/android-2.png)
  
3. Open the **Chrome** browser.
4. Open the **Chrome Developer Tools (F12)**.
5. Click the options icon (vertical ellipsis) and select **More tools** > **Remote devices**.

   ![android-3](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/android-3.png)
   
4. Select your device from the list.

   ![android-4](./attachments/debug-a-mobile-app/android-4.png)
   
5. Inspect the tab from your mobile device to preview the view from your device on-screen and to gain access to the Chrome web inspector and the rest of the Developer Tools.

You can now take advantage of all the debugging tools you know and love with Mendix, including offline breakpoints, quick updates/refreshes, and the Chrome Developer Tools.

## 5 iOS and macOS <a name="iosAndMac"></a>
