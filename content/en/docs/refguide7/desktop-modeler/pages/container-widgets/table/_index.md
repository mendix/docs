Tables can be used to lend structure to a page. They contain a number of [rows](/refguide7/table-row/) and columns, the intersection of which is called a [cell](/refguide7/table-cell/). Each cell can contain widgets.

{{% /alert %}}

Cells can be merged horizontally and vertically to allow for asymmetric lay-outs. To merge cells the cell you wish to merge to must be empty. A merge can then be initiated either in a cell's context menu or by clicking the merge button that will automatically appear if you select an eligible cell.

Tables can be selected by clicking the white square in the upper-left corner.

Tables allow for a number of keyboard interactions. Examples include navigating between rows and columns with the cursor keys and copy(ctrl+c)/pasting(ctrl+v) rows and cells.
