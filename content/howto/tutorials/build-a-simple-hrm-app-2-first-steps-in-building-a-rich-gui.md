## 1 Introduction

This is the second how-to in a series of five on how to create a simple HRM application. In this how-to, you will learn how to build pages to manage the employees in your application.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a domain model
* Build pages

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Use the first how-to in this series: [Build a Simple HRM App Step 1: Create, Manage, and Deploy the App](build-a-simple-hrm-app-1-create-manage-and-deploy-the-app)

## 3 Creating a Domain Model

The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. It is central to the architecture of your application. The domain model consists of entities and their relations represented by associations.

To create a domain model, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Domain Model** of the **MyFirstModule** module:
2. Click **Entity** in the domain model editor to create a new entity:

    For more information about entities, see [Entities](/refguide7/entities) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
3. To edit the properties of this new entity, double-click the new entity to open the properties window.
4. In the **Name** field, enter *Employee*:

5. Click **New** to add a new attribute:

    For more information on attributes, see [Attributes](/refguide7/attributes) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
6. In the **Name** field, enter *Name*:

8. Click **OK**.
9. Repeat steps 4–7 above for the following attributes:<br>

   Name | Type
   --- | ---
   Address | String
   City | String
   State | String
   Phone | String
   Email | String
   DateOfBirth | Date and time

The entity will look like this:

### 4.1 Adding a Page

To add a page, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the **MyFirstModule** module and select **Add** > **Page**:
