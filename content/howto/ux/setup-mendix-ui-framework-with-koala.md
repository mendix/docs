## 3 Creating a New App in the Mendix Desktop Modeler

4.  You can now deploy your app or just head over to section 3 to configure Koala.

## 4 Configuring Koala

The Mendix UI Framework uses **Sass**, which relies on Ruby. However, you can install [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) to run Sass in a self-contained Ruby environment, letting you effortlessly manage all of your Sass projects with a handful of clicks. This way you don't have to worry about using the terminal. You can still do this if you are familiar with Sass and terminal.

1.  Open your **App Project Folder** in Koala by clicking on the plus button in the left sidebar at the top (or drag your folder in Koala).

2.  Select the **project directory** from your newly created App. Koala automatically detects the Sass and CSS files and you are ready. Koala automatically compiles the files you want to adjust.

## 5 Configuring Your Text Editor

1.  Open the **Project Directory** from your App in your desired text editor.

2.  The **theme** folder is where you can find the theme that was selected when creating the New App. The folder theme\styles\sass\custom will be used to make our own changes. Let's change the background for our sidebar!
3.  Open up the file <u>**custom-variables.scss**</u> .

    Let's take a look at **Step 2** in the **custom-variables.scss** file. As the comments suggest we can adjust the background-color for the sidebar.
4.  Change the color from white (#FFF) to red (#FF0000) and save the file.

5.  Deploy (or redeploy) your app and see the change you made to the sidebar!

    As you can see our sidebar is now red, not the best look and feel but it works!
