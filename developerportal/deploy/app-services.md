## 1 Introduction

The **App Services** page provides an overview of possible resources that can be published to the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/):

*   App Service
*   Application
*   Widget

## 2 App Service

App Services are aimed to share a functionality between your Mendix Apps. You can create the App Services in your **Mendix Modeler** and publish the created App content and functionality within your company or to the entire Mendix Community. Users of your app service can directly drag and drop actions in the **Mendix Modeler** that you designed into their microflows and use your entities and data in their Apps. 

On the **App Service** page you can see an overview of the available app services, what the current status is and with who the App Service is shared with .
