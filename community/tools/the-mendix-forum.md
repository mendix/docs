## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com/index3.html) is where the Mendix Community comes together to help each other out with questions and answers and to propose ideas for improving the Mendix app platform.

The forum is closely integrated with the Community Profile so that Mendix Community members can see all the interesting and useful information about who is participating in the forum. If someone clicks your name anywhere on the forum your Community Profile will open, so make sure you set your Community Profile to public so everyone can see your avatar, details, and progress!

There are three tabs available in the forum: **Dashboard**, **Questions**, and **Ideas**. This reflects the fact that the forum is divided into two main sections: the question forum (located on the [Questions tab](#QuestionsTab)) and the idea forum (located on the [Ideas tab](#IdeasTab)).

## 2 Dashboard Tab

The **Dashboard** tab presents an up-to-date picture of forum activity in the **Questions** and **Ideas** sections as well as your total forum activity (if you are logged in).

### 2.1 Questions Section<a name="QuestionsSection"></a>

The **Questions** section presents a selection of questions from the question forum:
