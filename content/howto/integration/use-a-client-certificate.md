## 1 Introduction

Some services require you to authenticate using a client certificate. This how-to describes how to configure your app to do this.

Let's assume that you already have an app that calls a service. For details on how to configure this, have a look at [How to Consume a REST Service](consume-a-rest-service) or [How to Consume a Simple Web Service](consume-a-simple-web-service).

Client certificates for REST services were introduced in version 7.2.0.

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Configure to run locally
* Configure in the Mendix Cloud

## 2 Prerequisites

* A PKCS12 certificate file that contains a private key â€” these files typically have the _.pfx_ or _.p12_ file extension
* The password to open that file

## 3 Running Locally

To configure the custom settings that are only used when you run your app locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your app in the Modele and go to **Project** > **Settings**.
2. Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Configuration** dialog box, and select the **Custom** tab.
3. Add two custom settings to specify the paths to the certificates (ClientCertificates) and matching passwords (ClientCertificatePasswords). Also, add a third setting (ClientCertificateUsages) to specify which service should use which certificate if you use more than one certificate in your app.

    Name | Value | Notes
    --- | --- | ---
    ClientCertificates | The paths to the certificate files. | Separate with commas if you have more than one file. Backslashes in the paths should not be doubled.
    ClientCertificatePasswords | The password for each certificate file.  | In the same order as the **ClientCertificates**.
    ClientCertificateUsages **(Optional)** | The description of which files to use for which service, in the format `"ModuleName.WebserviceName": "path"` (for web services) or `"www.server-to-contact.com": "path"` (for REST services). | If you have more than one service to configure, you can separate them with commas. Enclose the whole setting value in braces (`{ }`). Backslashes in the paths must be doubled. In addition, the paths you specify here should all appear in **ClientCertificates**.

This is an example:

```
{ "Module.WebService1": "D:\\App\\Mx1.pfx", "www.server-to-contact.com": "D:\\App\\Mx2.pfx" }
```

A complete configuration may look like this:

You can use an empty path to specify that you do not want to use a client certificate, even when the server accepts one. The following sample uses client certificate `Mx1.pfx` for `WebService1` and no client certificate for `WebService2`:

```
{ "Module.WebService1": "D:\\App\\Mx1.pfx", "Module.WebService2": "" }
```

The possibility to use an empty path was introduced in Mendix version 7.18.0.

## 4 Running in the Cloud

You will only be able to follow the steps below if you have the correct access rights for the client certificates.

To configure client certificates in the Mendix Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://home.mendix.com/) and go to the **Environments** page for your app.
2. Each environment has its own configuration. Click **Details** next one of the environments.
3. Click **Network** and scroll down to **Certificates for outgoing connections**.
4. Click **Add client certificate**. Upload the certificate files.
5. Only follow these steps if you are using more than one client certificate in your app:<br>
    a. After the files have been uploaded, they appear in the list. Double-click an item in the list.<br>
    b. In the **Pin Client Certificate to Web Services** section of the **Details** screen, you can specify which client certificate belongs to which service:<br>
       * For web services, enter the name of the web service (for example, *ModuleName.WebServiceName*)<br>
       * For REST services, enter the host name of the endpoint (for example, *example.com*)<br>
    d. Close the **Details** screen.<br>
6. Click **Stop application** and then **Start application**.
