The second step allows you to select an existing app, or create a new app, in the Cloud Foundry organization. This is where your Mendix app will be deployed.

### 3.1 Organization

Select the **Organization** you want to use. If no organizations are available, you will need to configure one in your Cloud Foundry account; it is not possible to create a new one from within Mendix Studio Pro.

### 3.2 Space

Select the **Space** you want to use. Note that the space you want to use must already be configured in your Cloud Foundry account; it is not possible to create a new one from within Mendix Studio Pro.

### 3.3 App

Either **Select existing app** if you want to use an existing app environment, or **Create new app** if you want to create a new app environment.

#### 3.3.1 Select Existing App

If you **Select existing app** you will be able to choose the correct app from a drop-down list.

#### 3.3.2 Create New App

If you **Create new app** you will need to do the following:

1. Select the **Domain** in which the app will run from the drop-down.
2. Enter the **App name** for the app.

The URL for your app will be {App name}.(Domain).

### 3.4 Buildpack

Here you can enter the URL of the **Buildpack** you want to use in your Cloud Foundry app. Only change this if you don't want to use the default Mendix buildpack.
