## 1 Introduction

The Epics tool enables your team members to collaborate efficiently during the app development process. It supports the Scrum workflow and Kanban workflow. 

{{% alert color="warning" %}}As of the GA release on December 1st, 2022, Epics is the default project management tool for all new apps. </br>You can still use [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/) in addition to Epics. However, Mendix recommends only using one tool at a time in an app, as using both will make data migration more difficult later.{{% /alert %}}

### 1.1 Getting Your Team Access to an App in Epics

Only a Scrum Master can give the team access to an app in Epics. To do so, the Scrum Master must open the app in the [Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/myapps), go to the [Project Management](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#project-management) tab on the **General Settings** page, and click **Switch to Epics**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/project-management.png" width="600px" >}}

This gives everyone in the team access to this app in Epics. To give the team access to another app in Epics, the Scrum Master must repeat this procedure.

### 1.2 Opening an App in Epics

Once you have access to an app in Epics, open it in the [Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/myapps) and then go to the [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/) page. There is a notification at the top of the page where you can click **Check it Out** to open the app in Epics:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/epics-check-it-out.png" >}}

After you open the app in Epics, you can easily switch to other apps that you have access to. To do so, click the name of the current app on the upper-left corner, and then select a different app from the drop-down list.

### 1.3 Pages in Epics

Epics has the following pages: **Board**, **Planning**, **Epics**, and **Archive**. The **Board** page and **Planning** page look different, depending on if you are working in the Scrum workflow or Kanban workflow. All the pages are described in the sections below.

## 2 Board {#board}

The **Board** page gives an overview of all the stories that your team is currently working on.

On the upper-right corner of the page, you can find the following items:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/create-epic-story-search.png" >}}

* **Project Buzz**  – directs you to the [Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz/#app-buzz) page of the app

* **Create Epic** – opens a dialog box where you an create an epic

* **Create Story** – opens a dialog box where you can create a story

* Search box – enables searching stories based on story title, tags, epic name, assignee (and unassigned stories), and story ID.

### 2.1 Scrum Board vs Kanban Board {#different-boards}

Depending on your settings of [board type](#board-type): Scrum or Kanban, the main area of the board looks different.

#### 2.1.1 Scrum Board

If you work with the Scrum board, on the upper-left corner, you can find the name of the Sprint, when it ends, and how many stories and points it has. The area right below shows the goal of the current Sprint.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/sprint-goal.png" >}}

The main area gives an overview of your current Sprint. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}When you commit changes in Studio Pro, you can link your commit to stories of the current Sprint in Epics in the [Commit](/refguide/commit-dialog/) dialog box.{{% /alert %}}

You can edit or end the current Sprint on the [Scrum Planning](#scrum-planning) page.

#### 2.1.2 Kanban Board

If you work with the Kanban board, the upper-left corner of the page shows the number of stories and the total points. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/stories-story-points.png" >}}

The main area gives an overview of all the stories that your team is working on. 

### 2.2 Swimlanes

In the main area of the board, the stories are grouped into different swimlanes based on their status. 

The two default swimlanes are **To Do** and **Done**. 

You can add more custom swimlanes, such as **In Progress**, **In Review**, and **Testing**. To add a new swimlane, hover over the border of the swimlane where the new swimlane should be added, and click the vertical line when it appears. Then enter the name of the swimlane and click **✓** to save the changes.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/add-swimlane.png" width="500px" >}}

You can rename, [archive](#archive), or delete a swimlane as follows: click the **...** icon on the upper-right corner of the swimlane, and then select the corresponding option.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/rename-archive-delete-swimlane.png" >}}

However, it is not possible to do the following actions:

* Delete a swimlane if it still contains stories
* Archive a swimlane if it contains no stories
* Delete the default swimlanes:  **To Do** and **Done**

You can move a swimlane by dragging it to the new location.

### 2.3 Story Cards

Each card in a swimlane represents a story:

### 3.1 Scrum Planning vs Kanban Planning {#different-plannings}

Depending on your settings of [board type](#board-type): Scrum or Kanban, the **Planning** page looks different.

#### 3.1.1 Scrum Planning {#scrum-planning}

If there is an active Sprint, on the upper-left corner, you can find the name of the Sprint, when it ends, and how many stories and points it has. The area right below shows the goal of the current Sprint.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/scrum-planning.png" >}}

On the upper-right corner, you can find **End Sprint** and **Edit Sprint**, or **Start Sprint**:

If there is an active Sprint, you can find **End Sprint** and **Edit Sprint**. When you end a Sprint, the system shows you how many stories were completed in that Sprint. All the completed stories are [archived](#archive) automatically, and you can decide where the unfinished stories should go. 

If there is no active Sprint, you can find **Start Sprint**. Once a Sprint is created, all the items in the **Next Sprint** are moved to the **Active Sprint** automatically. 

In the main area of the page, stories are grouped in these categories: **Active Sprint** (if there is an active Sprint), **Next Sprint**, **Refinement**, and **Backlog**.

#### 3.1.2 Kanban Planning {#kanban-planning}

   {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/data-migration-info.png" width="400px" >}}

3. Select the content you want to migrate.

   {{% alert color="warning" %}}Stories will become read-only once ALL sections have been migrated successfully. There is no further synchronization available between Developer Portal and Epics (or vice versa). After the migration is completed, the option to migrate is removed from Epics.{{% /alert %}}

   {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/data-migration-content.png" width="400px" >}}

4. A notification is sent in the Developer Portal's [top bar](/developerportal/#navigation) informing you of the status of the migration. An email is also sent with this information. You can open the [migration report](#migration-report) by clicking the notification or the button provided in the email.

##### 3.4.4.2 What Is Migrated?

These are the new locations of migrated stories:

| From Stories                    | To Epics                                   | Additional Information                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Sprint**               | **Active Sprint** in [Planning](#planning) | All stories are migrated to **To Do** swimlane with tags. |
| Rest of the Sprints and backlog | **Refinement** in [Planning](#planning)    |                                                           |
| Archived stories                | [Archive](#archive)                        |                                                           |

These are the new details of migrated stories:

| From Stories     | To Epics                                                     | Example             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Sprint **Name**  | Tag with this format: **sprint:Sprint_Name**                 | **Sprint_Sprint 1** |
| Story **Status** | Tag with this format: **status:Status**                      | **status:To-do**    |
| **Assignee**     | Story is assigned unless the assignee is not a member of the app team. |                     |

For example, here is a Sprint with three stories from [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/):

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/data-migration-example-stories.png" >}}

Here is the outcome after migration:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/data-migration-example-epics.png" >}}

Beside the story details above, the remaining details for your stories are migrated according to their equivalents in [Epics](#epics).

{{% alert color="warning" %}}In [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/), files are associated with Comments, not with Stories. In Epics, files can only be associated with Stories, not with Comments. Therefore, files migrated from Stories will lose their Comment context.{{% /alert %}}

##### 3.4.4.3 Migration Report {#migration-report}

The migration report is available a few seconds after the migration completes (timing depends on the number of stories you have).

Click **View Migration Report**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/migration-report-buttons.png" width="400px" >}}

The migration report then opens:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/migration-report.png" width="600px" >}}

The **Migration Configuration** section presents what you have selected to migrate and the status of that migration. 

The **Not Finished** status means that you can use the **Continue Migration** button option (this button is only available if a migration has failed or there is still some stories data left to migrate).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you still have content with the **Error** status (for example, in the **Unmigrated Stories** section) after retrying the migration via the **Continue Migration** button, Mendix recommends manually migrating that data from [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/) to Epics. Furthermore, if a section has been successfully migrated but there is still data that has not been migrated, Mendix recommends manually migrating the data.
