## 2021

### January 15th, 2021

#### Improvements

* We made Customer IDP accessible from the control center app.
* We made some styling improvements for the landing pages in the control center app.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in custom list view for all overview pages where selecting all, then deselecting a few items and then exporting them to excel caused disapperance of the deselected items on the page and yet exported the deselected items to the excel which was undesirable.
