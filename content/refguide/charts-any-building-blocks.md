## 1 Introduction

Any Chart is a widget which is available in the Mendix App Store here: [Any Chart](/appstore/modules/any-chart) module. The Any Chart module enables you to build all the chart types that are possible with Plotly.js up to the version mentioned in the widget description in the App Store. More about Plotly.js is available here: https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/.

Any Chart building blocks are pre-configured page building blocks with the basic properties of a chart already defined. They can be placed on a Mendix page in the same way as any other widget or building block. They contain samples of the **data** and **Layout** objects which are required to create a chart. These objects are used for demo purposes at run time when there is no Source attribute selected or when rendering sample data in the Studio preview.

## Properties

The Any Chart building blocks contain the basic configuration essential for the widget. Some changes need to be made to customize the look of the chart. The properties below should, as a minimum, be configured when placing an Any Chart building block in your app.

Open the properties of an Any Chart widget by double-clicking on the widget.
