## 1 Description

This article describes how to configure the users of a SQL server to create a secure environment for a Mendix based application.
To create a secure environment it is important to make a clear distinction between an user with an administrator role and a regular user of the application.

## 2 Instructions

* **Create an administrator:** Create a user with the administrator role, for example 'MendixAdmin'.
* **Set the server roles for the administrator:** Depending on the tasks this user has to execute the administrator role should be connected to the following database roles:

    | | Create Databases | Create Users | Database Maintenance | Complete Maintenance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | `dbcreator` | **X** |  |  | |
    | `diskadmin` | **X** |  |  | |
    | `processadmin` |  |  |  | |
    | `securityadmin` | | **X** |  | |
    | `serveradmin` |  |  | **X** | |
    | `setupadmin` |  |  |  | |
    | `sysadmin` |  |  |  | **X** |

* **Define the user mapping for the administrator:** Associate all the databases related to Mendix with the administrator. The template for these databases should be `dbo` and the role of the administrator should be: `db_owner`.
* **Create (a) database user(s) for each Mendix application:** Each Mendix application should have its own database user(s).
* **Set the server role for each user:** Associate each user with the role `public`.
* **Define the user mapping for each user:** Associate all the databases related to Mendix with their respective user(s). The template for these databases should be: `dbo` and the roles for each corresponding user should be: `db_datareader` and `db_datawriter`. Additionally, the user should be granted the `view definition` permission.
