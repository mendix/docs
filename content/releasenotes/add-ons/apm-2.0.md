## 2.0.22 {#2022}

* We added a check on start-up to detect if the proper agent *.jar* file has been loaded.
* We fixed an issue with [Client API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/client-api) requests, as `retrieve_by_microflow` and `retrieve_by_path` were not specifying their target.

## 2.0.21

* We released the Mendix 7 version of the agent for release [2.0.22](#2022) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.20

* We released the Mendix 6 version of the agent for release [2.0.22](#2022) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.19 {#2019}

* We changed the behavior for the advanced setting `memoryagentstoplimit`. Instead of the agent instantly stopping upon reaching the set limit, the agent now stops processing log messages and recording for a set time frame. If the memory usage does not decrease below the set limit when the set time frame expires, the agent shuts down completely; otherwise; the agent will resume.

## 2.0.18

* We released the Mendix 7 version of the agent for release [2.0.19](#2019) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.17

* We released the Mendix 6 version of the agent for release [2.0.19](#2019) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.16 {#2016}

* We removed the CORS headers from the `apm` request handler.

## 2.0.15

* We released the Mendix 7 version of the agent for release [2.0.16](#2016) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.14

* We released the Mendix 6 version of the agent for release [2.0.16](#2016) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).
* 
## 2.0.13 {#2013}

We made the following improvements to the browser agent:

* We merged the statistics and recording collecting in order to reduce overhead and resource usage.
* We improved support for [Mendix 7.6](/releasenotes/studio-pro/7.6) and above.

We made the following improvements to the runtime agent:

* We improved the JSON logging set behind an advanced setting.

## 2.0.12

* We released the Mendix 7 version of the agent for release [2.0.13](#2013) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.11

* We released the Mendix 6 version of the agent for release [2.0.13](#2013) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.10 {#2010}

This is the first release for [Mendix 8](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.0).

We made the following improvements to the browser agent:

* We now prevent the browser agent from showing an error in the client in case a widget initialization fails.
* We fixed the browser agent usage in combination with a username with Chinese characters.

## 2.0.9

* We released the Mendix 7 version of the agent for release [2.0.10](#2010) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.8

* We released the Mendix 6 version of the agent for release [2.0.10](#2010) (which contains the Mendix 8 version).

## 2.0.7 {#207}

* We improved the memory so that by default 80% heap memory clears buffers, and 90% heap memory stops the APM agent. This is configurable in the advanced settings.
* We optimized the code.
* We improved performance so that they maximum depth for microflow statistics with a manually created loop is reduced.

## 2.0.6

* We released the Mendix 6 version of the agent for release [2.0.7](#207) (which contains the Mendix 7 version).

## 2.0.5 {#205}

* If logs and performance run as threads, there is a limit on the buffer between the Mendix log thread and the APM threads. If the Mendix Platform delivers too quickly, APM will now drop the messages.
* Advanced settings have been added to allow for the following functions:
	* **Use profiler**
	* **User recorder**
	* **Max trap collection**
	* **Max statistics collection**

	With this, the agent can be tuned, and the settings cannot be overruled from the manager (for example, for protecting a production environment or in the event of conflicts for not using the profiler).
* There is now the **NONE** option for statistics and trap collection, with which you effectively turn off the tools.
* There is now a hard-coded maximum of messages that the APM agent and APM Manager can accept from a Mendix log thread for both the message and stack trace.
* There is now  a maximum message length in `MendixMessage` via an advanced setting.
* `excludenodes=<node:level,node:level,...>` can now be used to not subscribe to certain nodes above the specified level. This feature can be used exclude log nodes (for example, as a workaround for a Mendix 6 web service and Mendix 7 bugs).
* There is now a load tool bug fix for recording and processing query IDs.
* The load tool loads XML pages on need, since the [create object](/refguide/create-object) button action has no `open_form` in the Client API.
* We fixed APM statistics that were counting some microflows multiple times depending on the amount of call sources.
* The performance recording of SQL statements is now functioning again.
* There is now an hourly purge of performance tool memory structures (together with statistic snapshot uploads) to prevent out-of-memory issues if, for example, many microflows end in error.
* Some extra clearing of memory structures has been added for a faster release memory and to give the Java garbage collector an easier job.

## 2.0.4

* We released the Mendix 6 version of the agent for release [2.0.5](#205) (which contains the Mendix 7 version).

## 2.0.3

* We fixed an issue that caused the agent not to detect a microflow had finished. As a result the microflow was always shown as a long-running microflow. This is no longer the case.
* We fixed an issue in which the agent logged a settings change, even though no changes were made.
* Captured actions of the **Retrieve by XPath** type now include the entity name.
* When a timeout occurs between the agent and the manager, the agent now logs it as **INFO**.
* When a connection is lost with the APM Manager, the agent now delays each subsequent call to the manager until a connection has successfully been made. The maximum delay is 5 minutes per interval.
* We added the capturing of SQL statements to the performance recorder.
* We added functionality to put a pause on the agent when the manager is down for maintenance.
* We made various performance optimizations.

## 2.0.2

The Mendix 6 version of the agent in release 2.0.3, which contains the Mendix 7 version.

## 2.0.1

* Added support for file uploads for Load Testing
* Reduced logging from the Agent
* In case of an error while transmitting data to the APM Manager, logging the full JSON messages now default disabled.
* In case the Browser Agent is disabled per configuration on the APM Manager, the agent no longer log an error when a user opens the application.

## 2.0.0

This major release of APM deals with cloud, end-user measurements, and simplicity.

### Cloud Multi-Tenant

APM 2 is a multi-tenant cloud-based app that is integrated with the Mendix Developer Portal for your project and SSO. 

To use APM, you only need to install the **APMAgent2** module.

These are the main advantages of this architecture:

* The agent does not have a UI in your app and does not need permissions and navigation
* The agent does not use your database to store traces
* The agent has even less of an impact on your app than it already had
* New features in the cloud manager app become quickly available and do not need a deployment of your app

### Simplified UI and functionality

APM 2 has a new UI that is in line with Mendix. The whole APM Manager App has been revised to simplify and ease the use.

* A tour guide has been added to help you use APM to perform specific jobs.
* Many settings that were never changed have got a proper default. 
* Some technical settings have been combined into an end-user understandable setting like memory-usage high, medium or low.
* The former log tool and trap tool are combined into the logs.
* The recorder stores immediately, so recording is just a start/stop function and no longer needs processing.

The statistics can now store action statistics as well. This will give detailed insights in microflows and actions without recording at all. So, when this option is selected, you just have to look at the statistics and start fixing!

Because the agent no longer needs security and navigation, the installation has been simplified as well.

You now have one place—the **APM 2 Manager** app—for managing the performance of all your apps.

### End-User Measurements

We added a browser agent that measures performance from the browser side. This agent collects statistics and can record individual traces. 

Measuring real end-user experiences allows you to grasp the actual end-user experience and not miss out on performance issues caused by a network, a slow browser, or apps that send too much data or are too chatty.

The browser agent works in desktop browsers, mobile device browsers, and Mendix-native PhoneGap apps.

The browser agent statistics now even show click-paths. This is an inital version of a feature that shows huge potential in seeing how your app is really used!

### Upgrade Notes

APM 2 can run side-by-side with APM 1. You can uninstall APM 1 in a later release if you want.

There is no data migration from APM 1 to APM 2.

Compared to APM 1, the following APM 1 features have been removed:

* APM 2 has no measurements tool (but it does measure CPU and memory)
* APM 2 has no JVM browser and does not give you the option to measure all JMX-exposed data (this feature had the most value in on-premises situations and was not used by a lot at customers; in addition, this feature is handled by any generic APM solution)
* APM 2 has no query tool to execute manual queries
* APM 2 has no SQL statements in performance traces and thus no explain-plan function
* APM 2 does not re-route Java console and Java until logging to the Mendix log

Due to these simplifications, a lot of minor features may have been simplified, combined, or totally removed.
