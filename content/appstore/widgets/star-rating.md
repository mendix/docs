## 1 Introduction

The [Star Rating](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/54611/) widget enables rating an object with stars or custom icons.

### 1.1 Features

* Rate an object with stars
* Display average rating
* Display rating in whole and half stars
* Execute a microflow when the rate is changed
* Configurable star colors
* Flexible number of stars
* Support for mobile touch events

## 2 Configuration

### 2.1 Customizing the Rating Icon

In order to overwrite the default star icon, add these classes to your project theme and replace the content with your preferred glyphicon:

```
 .rating-flag [class*="widget-star-rating-full"]:before {
  content: "\e034"; /* flag icon */ 
 }
.rating-flag .widget-star-rating-empty:before {
  content: "\e034"; /* flag icon */
 }
```
The `rating-flag` class should be added to the widget configuration on the **Common** tab.

### 2.2 Configuring the Security

Security is a mandatory feature for ratings. This is an example configuration:

For the **Campaign** entity access rules, a **User** should only be able to read the average attribute:

For the **Rate** entity access rules, the **User** should be able to only write their own rating:

When creating a new rating, its important to use the current user's previous rating as the initial rate value. Use a microflow like on the example below for the custom rate-me button:

To calculate the average rate, add a microflow like the one in the example below to the after-commit and after-delete event handlers in the domain model:
