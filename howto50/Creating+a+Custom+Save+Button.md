Mendix uses visual models to define the logic of your application, we call those models Microflows. A Microflow is a visual way of expressing what traditionally would be written in code. This how-to explains how you can create a custom save button on a detail page by utilizing Microflows.

## 1\. Preparation

Before you start with this how-to please complete the following prerequisites:

*   Create a basic domain model with [this how-to](Creating+a+basic+data+layer)
*   Create overview and detail pages for the Customer object using [this how-to](Creating+your+first+two+Overview+and+Detail+pages)
*   Create a menu item to access the customer overview page using [this how-to](Setting+Up+the+Navigation+Structure)

## 2\. Replacing the Default Save Button with a Custom one

1.  Open the **customer detail** page. It should look similar to this:

5.  Change the caption to _Save._
6.  Change the image to an image of your choice.
7.  Click **Select...** in the **Events** section to add a new microflow with the name _Customer_Save_.
8.  Save the new Microflow button by clicking **OK**.

## 3\. Re-creating the Default Save Behavior

1.  Right click the new Microflow button and select **Go to microflow** to open the new Microflow

    The Microflow should look like this:

3.  If you can't find the toolbox, you can re-open it from the view menu.

4.  Drag a **Commit object(s)** action from the toolbox to the line between the green start and red end event. This inserts a commit action activity.
5.  Double click the new activity to open its **properties.**
