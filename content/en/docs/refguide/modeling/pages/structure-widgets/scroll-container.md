## 1 Introduction

A scroll container is used to divide the layout in regions (for details on regions, see the [Scroll Container Region](#scroll-container-region) section) such as the header, sidebar, or footer. A scroll container must be the only top-level widget. Apart from that, a scroll container can only be placed directly in another scroll container.

Scroll containers may be placed on navigation layouts as well as on pages.

The scroll container example below divides the layout in three parts: a header containing an image, a part in the middle with a long piece of text, and a footer. You can scroll the long text inside the container, without scrolling the page.

A scroll container can consist of several scroll container regions. For more information on scroll container regions and their properties, see the [Scroll Container Region](#scroll-container-region) section. 

## 2 Properties

An example of scroll container properties is represented in the image below:

| Push content aside | The sidebar moves the rest of the content off-screen. |

| Shrink content (initially open) | The content is initially shrunk and the sidebar is displayed. The content expands when the sidebar is toggled. |
| Shrink content (initially closed) | The sidebar is initially hidden and the content shrinks to make space for it when it is toggled. |
