## 1 Introduction

In **Stories**, you are able to manage Sprints, stories, and labels for your app project. These components are often used in an Agile development environment, in which teams work in short development cycles (Sprints) of 2–4 weeks.

By adding your Sprints to Mendix, you will have a clear overview of your tasks and can easily view the status of the development of your app project. You can create, refine, and prioritize user stories collaboratively using the stories' conversation threads. User stories can be estimated and organized into Sprints which can be monitored using Scrum boards and burndown charts.

You can also manage the progress of tasks and Sprints from within Mendix Studio Pro via the [Stories Pane](/refguide/stories-pane).

## 2 Actions

You can perform the actions described below via the buttons on your app project's **Stories** page.

### 2.1 Creating a New Story {#new-story}

Every Sprint contains a number of stories that describe specific functionality to be implemented, built, or fixed. The size of each story can be indicated by allocating it a number of Story points.

To add a new story, click **New story** and fill in some details, including what your story is about and what type of story it is. The **Labels** you add in the new story can be reused in other stories (see [Using Labels](#label) for more details).

### 2.2 Creating a New Sprint {#sprint}

To add a new Sprint, click **New sprint** and fill in some details, including the name of the Sprint or release and where it should be located in the structure of your **Stories** page.

### 2.3 Moving a Story {#moving}

To move a story, select the story, click **Move to**, then select the Sprint to which the story should be moved:

![](attachments/stories/label.png)

You can also perform various actions to [manage labels](#manage-labels).

## 3 More Actions

Using the **More** button, you can perform the actions described below.

### 3.1 Delete Selection

![](attachments/stories/delete-selection.png)

### 3.2 Complete Current Sprint

Click **Complete current sprint** to complete a Sprint. Note that all stories have to be marked **Done** before you are able to complete a Sprint.

You will receive this confirmation message, so make sure you are able to confirm completion!

### 3.3 Import / Export {#import-export}

Click **Import / Export** to import stories from or export stories to Excel:

![](attachments/stories/import-export.png)

In Mendix, you can export stories from your app project at any time. If you select **Export a single sprint to Excel**, you can select just the stories in one Sprint and export these to Excel to work on.

You can also **Export all stories to Excel** and even **Export all stories to Excel (including completed sprints)**.

If you select **Updates stories from Excel**, you can use an an Excel sheet from a previous export as a template for the import. The Developer Portal recognizes existing items by using the **ID** column. The imported content will become stories for your app project.

When editing stories in Excel, follow these guidelines:

* To add a new story or task,  add a new line on the correct position and enter the item's name
* To reorder an item, adjust the depth by adding or removing the plus signs (make sure they stay consistent with every item being the same or 1 level deeper than the item above it)
* To remove an item, replace its depth with a single minus sign (make sure that any tasks associated with it are either moved or are also removed)

### 3.4 Manage Labels {#manage-labels}

Click **Manage labels** to open a page where you can list and manage your labels:

![](attachments/stories/labels.png)

| Button | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New Label | allows you to create a new label and allows you to assign a color to it.<br/>You can also create a new label by typing a new label name when you are creating a story. |
| Configure Label | allows you to change the name and/or color of an existing label. |
| Merge Label | allows you to merge the selected label into another label.<br/>All stories which have the selected label are labeled with the other label and the selected label is deleted. |
| Remove Label | allows you to remove the selected label from any stories to which it has been applied.<br/>The label is then deleted. |

### 3.5 Manage Story Template

Click **Manage story template** to create and edit the default tasks that can be added to every new story in your app project:

![](attachments/stories/default-task.png)

To enable these default tasks, select the **Add default tasks based on story template** check box when [creating a new story](#new-story).

### 4.4 Managing Stories in Mendix Studio Pro 

In addition to managing your sprints in the Developer Portal, you can view them in Studio Pro.

To manage stories in Studio Pro, follow these steps:

1. Open your app project in Studio Pro by clicking **Edit App** > **Edit in Mendix Studio Pro**:

	![](attachments/edit-app.png)

2. Open the **Stories** pane:

To change the status of a story in Studio Pro, click the current status. For example, click the **To-do** **Status** to change it to **Running**:

![](attachments/stories/stories-to-do.png)
