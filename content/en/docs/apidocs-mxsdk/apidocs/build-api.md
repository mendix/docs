## 1 Introduction

The Build API allows you to manage deployment packages and create new deployment packages using our build server. You will need the information from the [Teamserver API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/team-server-api/) as input for these API calls. You will also need to provide authentication for each call; this is described in [Authentication](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/authentication/).

The image below provides a domain model representation of the concepts discussed below and how these are related:

You will receive a response to indicate that the build has started. Depending on the complexity of your app, it may take some time before it is complete.

You can find out the status of your build by looking at the `status` from a [Retrieve Package](#retrieve-package) call. The status will be *Succeeded* once the package has been built successfully.
{{% /alert %}}

An object with the following key-value pair:

*   _PackageId_ (String) : Unique identification of the package. This string can be used to get the build status of the package later.

Error codes
