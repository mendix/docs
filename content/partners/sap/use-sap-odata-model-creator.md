## 1 Introduction

SAP data models reflect an OData service from SAP back-end systems like SAP Business Suite (SAP ERP 6.0), SAP S/4HANA, and SAP S/4HANA Cloud. OData services are exposed via SAP Gateway and are described in a `$metadata` file, which describes all the entities, relationships, and functions that are exposed for that service.

Handcrafting a Mendix domain model for these OData services would be a lot of work. The OData Model Creator for SAP solutions automates this process by creating a Mendix module for the selected service containing the Mendix domain model which can be imported in your project. The data model also contains additional information such as the URL of the exposed endpoint, a list of collections in the service, and a list of functions provided by the service.

There are four ways to create the data model:

* [Using the API Business Hub](#APIBusHub)
* [Selecting an API from the SAP Catalog Service](#catalog)
* [Uploading an Odata Metadata XML File](#Uploading)
* [Providing the URL to the Metadata](#URL)

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Identify the SAP back-end system and OData service you wish to use
* Create an app in Mendix Studio Pro (version 7.23.6 or above)
* Obtain authentication credentials, if needed, for the SAP Catalog Service or SAP back-end system you wish to use

![](attachments/use-sap-odata-model-creator/model-creator-wizard-1.png)

There are four ways to generate your data model.

* If your SAP back-end system stores the OData API package on the SAP API Business Hub, you can create the data model from there; select **API Business Hub** as the source and continue with [Using the API Business Hub](#APIBusHub)
* If your SAP API is in the SAP Catalog Service, you can create the data model from there; select **SAP Catalog Service** and continue with [Selecting an API from the SAP Catalog Service](#catalog)
* If you have access to the metadata file, select **Manual** and continue with [Uploading an Odata Metadata XML File](#Uploading)
* If you have the metadata URL for the OData service, select **URL** and continue with [Providing the URL to the Metadata](#URL)

### 3.1 Using the API Business Hub{#APIBusHub}

Your SAP back-end OData API is held in the API Business Hub.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

### 3.3 Uploading an OData Metadata XML File{#Uploading}

You may want to generate the data model by hand using the `$metadata` file directly. This may, for example, not be in the API Business Hub.

One way to do this is by getting the OData metadata XML file. This file can be download from the OData service URL directly using the `$metadata` suffix. The browser will display the XML and you can use the right mouse button in most browsers to choose to download the XML file. Save the file locally. It is recommended that you save it in the **resources** folder of your Mendix app so that you can find it easily.

1.  Download the XML metadata file to your local drive.
