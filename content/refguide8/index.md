## 2 Studio Pro Functionality

Studio Pro allows you to create, test, and run apps. 

### 2.1 Modeling 

Modeling an app is the process of creating an app and involves creating pages, adding logic, configuring security, etc. For more information on what functionality you can use to model your app, see [App Modeling](modeling).  

### 2.2 Testing 

When it comes to testing your application, you first need to decide what you are going to test: integration with external services, app logic (microflows), etc. For more information on how to test your application, see [Testing](/howto8/testing). 

### 2.3 Deploying 

Studio Pro allows you to run and view your app locally or in the default environment.

For more information on options for deploying your app see [Deployment](/developerportal/deploy).

## 3 Version Control

[Version Control](version-control) allows you to manage your app development, work on multiple development lines, as well as collaboratively work with [Mendix Studio](/studio).  For information on how Studio Pro handles versioning of apps, see the [Versioning a Project Deployed to the Cloud](using-version-control-in-studio-pro#versioning-project) section in *Using Version Control in Studio Pro*.
