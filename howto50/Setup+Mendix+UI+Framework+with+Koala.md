In this how-to we will go through how to setup the [Mendix UI Framework](https://ux.mendix.com/) with the program called Koala.

**After completing this how-to you will know:**

*   How to create a new App
*   How to setup Koala and the [Mendix UI Framework](https://ux.mendix.com/)
*   How to make your first styling changes

## 1. Preparation

Before you can start with this how-to, please make sure you have completed the following prerequisites.

*   Download the latest [Mendix Business Modeler](https://appstore.mendix.com)
*   Download [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) ([or use a different compiler](http://sass-lang.com/install))
*   Download text editor [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

## 2\. Create a new App in the Mendix Business Modeler

In this chapter we will create a new app and select a theme from the New App selector.

1.  Open the **Mendix Business Modeler**.
2.  Create a **New App** from the **My Apps** screen in the Mendix Business Modeler.

4.  You can now deploy your app or just head over to section 3 to configure Koala.

## 3\. Configure Koala

The Mendix UI Framework uses **Sass**, which relies on Ruby. However, you can install [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) to run Sass in a self-contained Ruby environment, letting you effortlessly manage all of your Sass projects with a handful of clicks. This way you don't have to worry about using the terminal. You can still do this if you are familiar with Sass and terminal.

1.  Open your **App Project Folder** in Koala by clicking on the plus button in the left sidebar at the top (or drag your folder in Koala).

2.  Select the **project directory** from your newly created App. Koala auto detects the Sass and CSS files and you are ready. Koala auto compiles the files you want to adjust.

## 4\. Configure your text editor

1.  Open the **Project Directory** from your App in your desired text editor.

2.  The **theme** folder is where you can find the theme that was selected when creating a New App. The folder theme\styles\custom will be used to make our own changes. Let's change the background for our sidebar!
3.  Open up the file _custom-variables.scss.

    Let's take a look at **Step 2** in the _custom-variables.scss file. As the comments suggest we can adjust the background-color for the sidebar. 
4.  Change the color from white (#FFF) to red (#FF0000) and save the file.

    As you can see our sidebar is now red, not the best look and feel but it works!
