## Description

Moves to a certain point on the current page and clicks it. The actual system mouse pointer is not moved. 

## Usage

Pass the horizontal and vertical coordinates as X and Y offset. By default, the upper-left corner of the current page is used as point of origin.

If you want to start from a reference element, pass in the desired reference element. ATS will use the upper left corner of the reference element as new point of origin for calculating the desired click-position.
