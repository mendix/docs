## 1 Introduction {#introduction}

The **Notify workflow** activity can be used to notify a [workflow](/refguide/workflows/) that is suspended on the [Wait for notification](/refguide/wait-for-notification/) workflow activity.

If the workflow is suspended on the specified wait for notification activity, then this activity will return `true` and the workflow execution will continue further. Otherwise, it will simply return `false`.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
When you try to notify a workflow which is already `Completed` or `Aborted`, it will result in a Runtime error. For information on how to handle the error, see [Error Handling in Microflows](/refguide/error-handling-in-microflows/).
