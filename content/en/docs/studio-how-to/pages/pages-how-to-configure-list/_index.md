## 1 Introduction 

On pages in Mendix Studio, you can add a list of items and show the item details selected in this list. Depending on your use case, you might want to show a list of items on one page and show item details on a separate pop-up page, or you can show a list of items and item details on the same page.

The following how-tos are available here:
