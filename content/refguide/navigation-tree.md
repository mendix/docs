## 1 Introduction

A navigation tree displays menu items of a [navigation profile](navigation#profiles) or [menu](menu) document in the form of a tree. These items are determined by the [Menu source](#menu-source) and are either configured in the [Navigation](navigation) or a [Menu](menu).

The menu structure of a navigation tree can have three levels, that means that menu items can have sub-items. For more information on menu items and their properties, see [Menu](menu).
