Page templates fill newly created pages with content. Instead of starting with an empty page, you start with a beautiful design which you can then customize to match your needs. The base of the page templates is the "Create Page" form.

When creating a new page there are multiple choices to be made.

*   **Layout type**. On top you select the type of layout the page will use: responsive, tablet specific or phone specific.
*   **Page name**.
*   **Naviga****tion layout**. Layout to base the page on. These are filtered based on the selected layout type. The module name is displayed between parentheses.
*   **Category list**. On the left the page template categories are displayed.
*   **Page template**. The page templates are filtered by category and show a preview of what they will look like in the web browser.

### Changes in page generation

Generated pages will contain a [layout grid](layout-grid) and input widgets will have their built-in labels enabled. For existing projects this might mean that the new pages will not be styled properly as the page structure is different.

## Images

Page templates may contain (placeholder) images. These images are copied to an image collection named "PageTemplateImages" in the module where the newly created page resides. If the image collection with that name does not exist, it will be made.

The image collection is a regular image collection. You can change the images and remove them. However, if an image is used you will get an error in the Modeler.
