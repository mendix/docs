## 1 Introduction

Your App Team can include all of your colleagues working on developing an app as well as ideating for and reviewing it. Mendix enables developers from both IT and business with mixed experience levels to collaborate in the Developer Portal while building dynamic applications.

1. Click **Apps** in the top navigation panel of the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) and select the app you want to manage.
2. Click **Team** under the **Collaborate** category.

On the **Team** page, you will see an overview with the following information about the team members:

* **Name**
* **Role** – the developer's App Team role (for details on available roles, see the [App Team Roles](../company-app-roles/index#app-team-roles) section of *Company & App Roles*)
