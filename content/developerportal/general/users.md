### 2.1 Create Report

You can create reports about users active in your company (either by being a member of the company or a member of an app owned by the company). You will be presented with the following options:

* **Export Users** – this report will return a list of users who are active in your company

You can export these reports by clicking **Export to Excel**. Note that the exports will contain further details in addition to those shown on the screen.

*   Add/remove security groups
*   Set up a security group by clicking **Details** for a group, where you can do the following:
    * Add a member by clicking **Add**
