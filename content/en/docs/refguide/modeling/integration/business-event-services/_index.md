## 1 Introduction

Studio Pro 10 integrates with Mendix Business Events module functionality. With the [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/services/business-events/) module, applications can signal when something important happens and can subscribe to these events if they want to be informed. Business events are like a mailing list to share event notifications between apps.

This page references the **Business Event Service** documents in Studio Pro. See [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/services/business-events/) for the complete documentation.

You must have the [Mendix Business Events](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/202649) module installed for it to work properly. If it is not installed, you will be prompted to download it and add it to your app.
