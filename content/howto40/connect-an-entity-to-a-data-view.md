## Description

## Instructions

 **Add the data view to your form. If you do not know how to add widgets to a form, please refer to [this](add-a-widget-to-a-form) article.**

### Method 1

 **Select the data view. Look up the entity you want to connect to it in the Connector window, click on it and drag it to the yellow header of the data grid.**

 **You will be asked if you want to have the Modeler fill the data view based on the attributes of the entity. If you choose 'Yes', the Modeler will automatically create content widgets and labels and connect them to the attributes of the entity. If you choose 'No' the entity is connected to the data view, but you have to add the content widgets and labels and connect them to the attributes yourself.**
