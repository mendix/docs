When enabled, all users accessing the Mendix application from a PhoneGap hybrid application running on a tablet device will automatically be redirected to this profile. If disabled, tablet users will be redirected to the [Hybrid phone profile.](hybrid-phone-profile) Lacking that, the user will be redirected to the [Desktop profile.](desktop-profile)
