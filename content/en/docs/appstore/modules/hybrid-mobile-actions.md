## 2 Dependencies

The actions above are dependent on Cordova plugins. Most dependencies are already provided in the standard template. When building your hybrid mobile app, make sure you add and enable the dependencies by first enabling in **Permissions** by selecting the following:

* Calendar
* Camera
* Photo Library
* Contacts

Next, add the following snippet to the custom Cordova configuration:

```
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-android-fingerprint-auth" source="npm" spec="1.5.0" /> <plugin name="cordova-plugin-touch-id" source="npm" spec="3.4.0" /> <plugin name="cordova-clipboard" source="npm" spec="1.3.0" /> <plugin name="cordova-plugin-media" source="npm" spec="5.0.2" />
```

Note that the standard *config.xml* template already includes `cordova-plugin-contacts`, but due to a permission structure change for Android 9 that causes a crash on saving, it has to be replaced by the following snippet:

```
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-contacts" spec="https://github.com/mendixlabs/cordova-plugin-contacts.git#3.0.2" />
```

Please note that the above plugins are not available in the in standard Mendix mobile app and can only be tested with a custom-built mobile app.
