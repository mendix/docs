## 1 Introduction

To open an app in Mendix Studio Pro, do one of the following:

* Select **File** > **Open App**
* Click **Open App** on the Studio Pro landing page

The **Open App** dialog box will open, where you can [select an app](#select-app) from your apps, [open an app locally](#open-locally), or [import an app package](#import-app):

Apps can be located on the Team Server, on another SVN server, or on the local disk. When opening an app from the Team Server or another SVN server, Studio Pro will check whether you have already downloaded this app. If so, it will simply open it. If not, the app will be downloaded from the version control server first.
