## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for installing Private Mendix Platform, along with its optional components, in your own Kubernetes environment.

### Prerequisites

Private Mendix Platform depends on Mendix for Private Cloud for the installation and deployment of Mendix apps.

Before starting the installation process, make sure that you have all the necessary prerequisites:

* A Kubernetes instance where the target namespace has already been created. For more information, see [Supported Providers: Supported Versions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-supported-environments/#supported-versions).
* A PostgreSQL 12 database.
* File storage. For more information, see [Supported Providers: File Storage](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-supported-environments/#file-storage).
* A registry. For more information, see [Supported Providers: Container Registries](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-supported-environments/#container-registries).
* A domain.
* For the PCLM component:

    * Mendix Operator in version 2.11.0 or above
    * A dedicated Postgres or SQLServer database server with public accessibility set to **Yes**.

* Optionally, if your Private Mendix Platform app requires its own certificate: a TLS certificate with HTTPS support.
* An environment to run installer tools with the following requirements:

    * A kubeconfig file with administrator privileges for your Kubernetes or OpenShift platform
    * A command line terminal that supports the console API and mouse interactions. In Windows, this can be PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt.
    * For OpenShit clusters, OpenShift CLI. For more information, see [Getting started with the CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/cli_reference/getting-started-cli.html).
    * Kubectl installed if you are deploying to another Kubernetes platform. For more information, see [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

* Optionally, if you plan to install the Svix component:

    * An existing PostgreSQL database instance
    * A Redis instance

## Installing and Configuring the Mendix Operator

To install and configure the Mendix Operator, perform the following steps:

1. Download the release binary from your [Private Mendix Platform download portal](https://privateplatform.mendix.com/). If you do not have access to the download portal, contact your Mendix partner for information.

2. Unzip the release binary to a local folder on your Windows or Linux server. The release binary contains the following files:

    * **Tools** - *mx-pclm-cli*, which can be used to manage PCLM
    * **helm**, and **helmfile** tools, which are used to deploy and manage Private Mendix Platform charts and Svix charts
    * **images** - Private Mendix Platform image, PCLM image, Svix image, test application image
    * **Installer** - installer tools
    * **mxpc-cli** - installation tools which can be used to manage or configure the Mendix Operator
    * **charts**  - charts, including Private Mendix Platform charts and Svix charts
    
    {{< figure src="/attachments/private-platform/pmp-binary.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Optional: If your clusters can connect to a public registry with a passable network, skip to step 4 below, otherwise initialize the installation by performing the following steps:

    1. Upload the images to your private repository in an air-gapped environment.

        ```text
        ~/mpp-binary-linux$ ./installer init  migrate --help
        Migrate Mendix Private Platform related image to your own registry

        Usage:
        installer init migrate [flags]
        Flags:
            -h, --help                 help for migrate
            -r, --registryurl string   registry url (required)
            -e, --repo string          Repository name
            -u, --username string      Username (required) for your private registry
        ```

        The destination image is named `${registryurl }/${repo}/mendix-private-platform: ${tag}`.
    
    2. The `registryurl` and `repo` are read from the input parameters. The `tag` is automatically read by the installer. If the repository does not exist, you must create it before running the `init migrate` command.

        ```text
        ~/mpp-binary-linux$ ./installer init migrate   -r [registry] -u  user -e [repositoryName]
        Please enter user password: ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

        Confirm password: ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Adding Additional Components After Installing the Private Mendix Platform

To ensure that components such as svix and PCLM work correctly, you should install them before you install the Private Mendix Platform itself. If you want to add a component after the Platform installation (for example, if you want to install svix because you decided to enable webhooks), you must perform the following steps:

1. Install the component as described in [Installing Private Cloud License Manager](#install-pclm) and [Installing the Svix Component](#install-svix).
2. Run the command `./installer platform -n=<namespace name>`, where `-n` is the same namespace as the one where you installed Svix and PCLM.

Re-running the installation command ensures that the installer fetches the relevant information from the components that you added.

## Upgrading the Private Mendix Platform

If you have installed Private Mendix Platform before, you can upgrade it by doing the following steps:

1. Ensure that your Mendix Operator version is 2.12 or newer.
2. Run the command `./installer platform -n=<namespace name>`, where `-n` indicates the namespace where your Private Mendix Platform is installed.
3. Click **Upgrade Namespace**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/private-platform/pmp-upgrade1.png" class="no-border" >}}

4. Verify the following settings:
    
    * **Persist Config** - When enabled, this setting locks the Private Mendix Platform configuration, so that it can no longer be modified from the user interface.
    * **Project Management** - Recommended. Enables you to create and manage your app projects. Enables app projects and related settings across the portal. Must be enabled for CI/CD capabilities.
    * **Marketplace** - Recommended. Enables you to use the Private Platform's Marketplace capabilities to upload, import and manage Marketplace contents. The Marketplace enabled here is hosted entirely within your Private Mendix Platform.
    * **Marketplace Approvals** - Optional. If enabled, contents that users publish to the private Marketplace require administrator approval before publishing.
    * **Marketplace Import** - Optional. Enables content import with an external source.
    * **IDP** - Optional. Enable users to login using SSO by configuring your IdP integration.
    * **Webhook** - Optional. Webhooks allow to send information between platform and external systems, and can be triggered by events around Apps, Users, Groups, Marketplace and CI/CD.

5. Click **Run Upgrade**.
