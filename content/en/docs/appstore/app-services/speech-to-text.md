## 1 Introduction

The [Speech to Text](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/118408) app service enables you to build an app to convert speech to text with state-of-the-art speech recognition. With this app service, your app can easily convert speech into text and trigger actions that you have specified. All you need to do is drag and drop items and configure them.

Here is an overview of what Speech To Text contains:

| Item                                        | Name                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [Predefined entities](#predefined-entities) | MediaDocument                    |
| [Constants](#constants)                     | LicenseToken, TokenEndpoint      |
| [Microflows](#microflows)                   | BatchTranscription, StartService |
| [Widgets](#widgets)                         | Microphone                       |

In most cases, you will only need what is contained in the **SpeechToText** > **USE_ME** folder. The content in the **SpeechToText** > **Internal** folder is for internal use only and you will not need it.

## 3 Configuration

### 3.1 Predefined Entities {#predefined-entities}

#### 3.1.1 MediaDocument

The **MediaDocument** entity is a conceptual entity that inherits from the **System.FileDocument** entity and incorporates all the information of media document. You can choose to inherit from this entity, set an association to the entity, or copy this entity to your module.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/mediadocument.png" alt="mediadocument" >}}

| Attribute        | Data Type | Description|
| ---------------- | ---- | -----------|
| `Transcript`   | String | The base64-encoded audio data string.     |
| `LanguageCode` | String | The [language code](#supported-languages) of this media document. |

### 3.2 Constants {#constants}

#### 3.2.1 LicenseToken

The **LicenseToken** constant provides a valid license token for an app that uses this app service. As Speech to Text is a commercial product, no matter your app is deployed in the [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/), your own environment, or locally in Studio Pro, you need to have a valid license token and configure it correctly. For details on how to get and configure a license token, see the [Obtaining a License Token](#obtain-license-token) section and [Configuring the License Token](#configure-license-token) section.

#### 3.2.2 TokenEndpoint

The **TokenEndpoint** constant provides a valid endpoint of security token service for the back-end authentication of the app service. The constant comes with a default value which points to the deployed security token service. The security token service issues security tokens that authenticate user's identity. 

### 3.3 Microflows{#microflows}

#### 3.3.1 StartService

The **StartService** microflow is a Java action which starts the Speech To Text service. It is used to set up a cognitive speech-to-text back-end server infrastructure, which is critical for realizing all the functions that Speech To Text provides.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/startservice.png" alt="startservice" >}}

#### 3.3.2 BatchTranscript {#batchtranscript}

The **BatchTranscription** microflow takes a **MediaDocument** object as an input parameter and converts the based64-encoded audio string into text.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/batchtranscription.png" alt="batchtranscription" >}}

### 3.4 Widgets {#widgets}

#### 3.4.1 Microphone {#microphone}

* **General** tab
   * **Enable language selection** – when set to **Yes**, your users can select different languages in your app
   * **language**  – sets the default language using a [language code](#supported-languages) (if empty, the default language is `en-US`)
* **Events** tab
  * **On transcript** – by binding a string attribute to the **transcript** property, which stores the real-time speech-to-text transcription result of a natural speech segment (for example a sentence), you can then set your custom **Action** that is executed when a transcript is received
     * **transcript**  – stores the transcription result of a real-time natural language segment (for example a sentence) upon successful speech-to-text conversion
     * **Action** – sets which action is executed when the transcript is received (if empty, no action is executed)
  * **On error** – by binding a string attribute to the **Error** property, you can obtain the error message raised by the back-end service and set a custom action that is executed when an error occurs
     * **Error** – sets a string attribute as the error message
     * **Action** – sets which action is executed when an error occurs
* **Voice to Action** tab
   *  **Enable action** – when set to **Yes**, the following custom settings for actions are enabled:
     * **Actions** – a list of actions to execute when a transcript matches an utterance
         * **Utterance** – a string template following natural language syntax or a valid JavaScript regular expression.
         * **Action** – the action that is executed when the received transcript matches an utterance
         * **Feedback** – the voice feedback provided to users when an action is triggered
   *  **Arguments** – the captured arguments in a transcript as a comma-separated list that are passed to **Actions**

## 4 Usage

### 4.1 Initializing Speech To Text When App Starts

It can be useful to run the Speech to Text service automatically when your app starts. The app service contains a Java action – the **StartService** microflow, which can start the Speech To Text service for you. You can use the [After startup](/refguide/project-settings/#after-startup) setting in your app to call the **StartService** microflow.

1. In the App Explorer, go to **Settings**. The [App Settings](/refguide/project-settings/) dialog box opens.
2. Go to the **Runtime** tab. 
3. Select the **StartService** microflow from the **SpeechToText** > **USE_ME** folder.
4. Set **After startup** to the microflow that calls the **StartService** microflow.

### 4.2 Converting Speech into Text in Your Browser {#convert-speech-into-text}

You can use Speech To Text to convert voice into text and then trigger a customizable action. To let the [Microphone](#microphone) widget convert speech to text, you need to set **On Transcript** event.

Below are the steps to build a simple example web app based on a blank app template which can convert speech to text and display real-time transcription result:

1.  In your app module's domain model, create an entity and name it *Microphone*, with the following attributes:
   * `NewTranscript` (String)
   * `AllTranscript` (String)
   * `Arguments` (String)
   * `Error` (String) 

2.  Create a nanoflow as follows:
    1. Name the nanoflow *CreateMicrophoneObject*.
    2. Add a create object activity to the nanoflow.
    3. Double-click the create object activity to open the **Create Object** dialog box. 
    4. **Select** the **Microphone** entity as the **Entity** and click **OK**. 
    5.  Right-click the create object activity and select **Set $NewMicrophone as return value** in the pop-up menu.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/createmicrophoneentity-nanoflow.png" alt="createmicrophoneentity-nanoflow" >}}

3. Add a **Data view** widget to your page.
4. Set the **CreateMicrophoneObject** nanoflow as the data source of the Data View widget as follows:
   1. Double-click the **Data view** widget to open the **Edit Data View** dialog box.
   2. For **Data Source**, select **Nanoflow** as the **Type**.
   3. **Select** the **CreateMicrophoneObject** nanoflow for **Nanoflow**.
   4. Click **OK** to save the settings.

5. Inside the **Data view** widget, add a [Microphone](#microphone) widget.
6.  Change the settings of the **Microphone** widget as follows:
    1. Double-click the **Microphone** widget to open the **Edit Microphone** dialog box. 
    2. Go to the **Events** tab. 
    3. For **transcript**, **Select** the **NewTranscript** attribute. In this way, the **NewTranscript** will contain the result of the real-time speech-to-text conversion of a natural language segment (for example a sentence). This value will be overwritten every time a new transcript is received.
    4. For **Action**, select **Save changes**, so the changed value of **NewTranscript** will be available across the app.
7. Inside the **Data view**, add a **Text area** widget.
8. Change the settings of the **Text area** widget as follows:
   1. Double-click the **Text area** widget to open the **Edit Text Area** dialog box.
   2. For **Data source**, select the **NewTranscript** attribute from **Data view**.
   3. Click **OK** to save the settings. 
9. Make sure that you have [configured the license token](#configure-license-token).
10. Run your app locally. Click the microphone icon, talk to it, and the text area will show you the real-time transcript as you speak.

{{% alert color="info" %}}While this simple example only displays the transcript result of the current speech segment, you can also configure **Action** to append all **NewTranscript** and display all your speech-to-text transcripts. For details, see the example screenshot in the [On Transcript](#on-transcript) section.{{% /alert %}}

### 4.3 Handling Microphone Events

Multiple events can be picked up by the [Microphone](#microphone) widget and can be used to build your customized event handling logic.

There are two main types of events that can be picked up by the **Microphone** widget, which are described in the sections below.

#### 4.3.1 On Transcript {#on-transcript}

By binding an attribute to the **transcript** event, the app can pick up the result of speech conversion. Upon successful transcription, this attribute will store the transcript of the real-time natural speech segment, which is identified by a change in the speaker or a pause in the audio.

**transcript** takes a string attribute. You can define an attribute and bind this attribute to **transcript**. This attribute stores the result of text converted from voice. The app can trigger an action after the transcript is received. You can select the custom **Action** from a list of actions.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/microphone-ontranscript-sample.png" alt="microphone-ontranscript-sample" >}} 

For example, you can set up the **Action** to append the transcript of each segment and show the transcript of the entire long speech input.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/show-transcript-history.png" alt="show-transcript-history" >}}

#### 4.3.2 On Error {#on-error}

By binding an attribute to the **Error** event, the app can pick up an error raised by the back-end service.

**Error** takes a string attribute. You can define an attribute and bind this attribute to **Error**. In a running app, when speech-to-text transcription fails, an error event will be triggered, and the error information will be populated to this **Error** attribute. The app can obtain this error message and trigger a custom action. You can select the custom **Action** from a list of actions.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/microphone-onerror-sample.png" alt="microphone-onerror-sample" >}} 

For example, you can set up the **Action** to make the app show a pop-up window to show error details to users.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/microphone-event-onerror.jpg" alt="microphone-event-onerror" >}}

### 4.4 Adding Speech-Triggered Actions to Your App

Once your app can [convert speech into transcript text](#convert-speech-into-text), you can configure **Utterance**, **Action**, and **Feedback** to set up speech-triggered actions. If a received transcript matches the **Utterance** that you specified, your app will execute the action and give the voice feedback that you configured. This is also known as a voice command. For example, you can set a rule that when a user speaks "open home page" to the microphone, the app opens the home page automatically, and gives user the voice feedback "the home page has been opened".

To set up speech-triggered actions, perform the following steps:

1. Double-click the **Microphone** widget. The **Edit Microphone** widget opens.
2. Go to the **Voice to Action** tab.
3. For **Arguments**, select **Arguments** from **Data view**.
4.  For each action, set up an [Utterance](#utterance), an [Action](#actions) and a [Feedback](#feedback).

    {{% alert color="info" %}}You can use **New**, **Delete**, and **Edit** to manage all the **Actions**.{{% /alert %}}

If the transcript received by the **Microphone** widget matches an **Utterance** that you specified, the app will run the **Action** and give users the voice **Feedback** that you configured.

#### 4.4.1 Utterance {#utterance}

**Utterance** can be a string template following natural language syntax or a valid JavaScript regular expression. It is self-defined rules used for matching the transcripts on speech conversion. Some internal trie filters are implemented to extract the key point of short sentences. 

For instance, you can set **Utterance** as `{rotate|move} the model {0:deg} degree around {1:x|y|z} direction`. Then if you say `rotate model 35 degree around x direction`, the **Microphone** widget will match the transcript to this utterance and trigger an action that you set. In **Utterance**, you can use multiple parameters (similar to the parameters written in JavaScript), for example `{order: name}`, to make it more flexible.

#### 4.4.2 Actions {#actions}

You can select an **Action** from a list of actions. This action is triggered when the received transcript matches an utterance.

#### 4.4.3 Feedback {#feedback}

**Feedback** is an optional configuration, which can be a string template following natural language syntax, which is provided to users after an action is triggered.

For instance, you can set **Feedback** as `model is rotated {0} degree around {1} direction`, with `{0}` and `{1}` being the parameters passed through **Arguments** in the **Microphone** widget.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/speech-to-text/microphone-voicetoaction-sample.png" alt="microphone-voicetoaction-sample" >}}

### 4.5 Using the Batch Mode

When you need to implement the speech conversion as a back-end service rather than in the user interface operation, batch transcription is your best option to convert any Mendix **mediaDocument** object into written text. In this case, use the [BatchTranscript microflow](#batchtranscript).

### 4.6 Checking Statistics on the Usage Dashboard {#check-usage}

The **Usage Dashboard** shows the real-time statistics about the usage of an app service. Perform the following steps to check the real-time statistics:

1. Log into the Marketplace.
2. Go to **My Marketplace** and then do as follows:

   * If you have a trial, click [My Subscriptions](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/mysubscriptions) on the left navigation menu. This page shows all the products that you have trials for.
   * If you have a subscription, click [Company Subscriptions](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/company/subscriptions) on the left navigation menu. This page gives an overview of all the subscriptions of your organization.
   
3. Find **Speech to Text** in the list.
