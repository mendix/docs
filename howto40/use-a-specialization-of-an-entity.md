## Description

This section describes how to use an inheritance split to use a specialization of an entity.

## Instructions

 **Open the microflow, or if necessary create a new one. If you do not know how to add documents to your project, please refer to [this](add-documents-to-a-module) article.**

 **After configuring the inheritance split, you will notice that the sequence flow paths leading out of it have turned red. Right-click on such a path and then under 'Condition value' choose the specialization for which this path should be executed.**

 **Create additional paths for every specialization. Add activities and, if necessary, end events to these paths to finish the microflow.**
