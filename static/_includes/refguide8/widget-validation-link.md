Here, you can specify predefined or custom validation which must be applied to the widget value before the data can be used. You can also customize the message which the end-user will get if the data does not pass the validation.

For more information on input widget validation, see the [Validation](/refguide8/common-widget-properties/#validation) section of *Properties Common in the Page Editor*.
