## 1 Introduction

An annotation is an element that can be used to put comments to a flow.

In the example below, you use a **Show message** activity to warn end-users about unpaid orders with a pop-up message in the client. Later you want to extend this warning with an e-mail message send to the user. You can use an annotation as a reminder and put it above the current activity.
