## 1 Introduction 

Image [widgets](page-editor-widgets-wm) are used to show images to the users. 

There are two image widgets in the Web Modeler:

* Image – allows you to show a static (non-changing) image in your app
* Dynamic image – allows you to show a dynamic image (for example, a relevant profile picture that is different for each customer) in your app

{{% alert type="info" %}}

You can switch between static and dynamic image in widget's properties. For more information, see the [General Section](#image-general). 

{{% /alert %}} 

## 2 General Section {#image-general}

You can switch between static and dynamic image in the **General** section, as well as set the image itself, configure its width and height, etcetera. 

Before configuring settings in the **General** section for the **Dynamic Image**, keep in mind that it can only function inside a data container (a list view or a data view). You can either place widget in an existing data container; or click **Wrap with a new data view** in **Properties** to create a data view automatically and place an input element inside it.
