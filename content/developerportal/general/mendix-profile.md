## 1 Introduction

Your Mendix Profile is your main point of contact with members of the Mendix community, as it displays your activities on the Mendix Platform as well as details about your background. There are plenty of ways to get more involved with the Mendix community, and your profile is the best place to start!

To access your Mendix Profile, hover over your picture on the right side of the Developer Portal navigation bar and select **My Profile** from the context menu.

## 2 Header

On the profile header, you can see your location, number of [connections](#connections), Mendix points, Mendix level, [credits ](#credits), and [badges](#badges). Other personal information is presented in the header as well as on the **Personal Info** card. This information can be easily edited to present accurate personal details, project roles, and skills you have gained. For all the details on editing your Mendix Profile, see the [Edit Mode](#editing) section below.

## 3 Overview

Your profile will open to the **Overview** tab. The first profile card below the header presents your **Stats**. The chart and its legend display your points divided between various Mendix products and activities. When analyzing your points, be sure to also check out the [Leaderboard](#leaderboard) card on this tab to see the top Mendix community contributors!

## 4 Badges {#badges}

In addition to the **Stats** chart, on the **Overview** tab you gain an overview of your **Badges**. These badges represent your achievements and progress on the Mendix Platform. You can see your **Badges in Progress** as well as **Next Badges**. The badges are color-coded based on their rarity, from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare). 

To see all of your badges as well as the badges you can work towards, click **View all** to go to the **Badges** tab of your profile.

## 5 Challenges

The **Challenge** card presents a featured challenge you can complete on the Mendix Platform to gain credits. Once you complete a challenge, you can claim the credits and use them in the Mendix Shop. Challenges are not only about keeping engaged with the platform and exploring new challenges, but picking up some swag in the process!

![](attachments/mendix-profile/credits.png)

Completing your challenges and gaining credits is a great way to stay engaged with the Mendix community. And the Mendix Shop will always have cool items for you to spend credits on!

## 6 Connections {#connections}

One of the greatest strengths of Mendix is our awesome developers community, and the **Connections** card is the perfect place to start networking with other Mendix developers. When you are invited by a Mendixite to connect, you can check out their profile and make a decision to accept or ignore the invitation.

You can also see a list of people you may know so that you can add further connections to your profile. To connect with someone, click the plus icon, and an invitation will be sent.

![](attachments/mendix-profile/connections.png)

Clicking **View All** on the card will bring you to the **Connections** tab of your profile. On this tab, you can invite friends and colleagues to Mendix in two ways:

* **Share URL** – copy the personalized invite link and share it on your personal website, blog, and social media channels, or share it directly via specific social media
* **Send invite** – send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address and clicking **Send invite**

![](attachments/mendix-profile/referral.png)

Once five of your referred users have signed up, you will see the **Claim your t-shirt** link. Click this to fill in some details and receive your awesome Mendix t-shirt!

## 7 Leaderboard {#leaderboard}

This card on your profile presents a selection of Mendix developers with the highest points.

![](attachments/mendix-profile/leaderboard.png)

Clicking **View all** takes you to the **Leaderboards** page, which presents all the boards available for viewing Mendix Platform user activity: **Top Overall**, **Top Forum**, **Top App Store**, **Top Platform**, **Top Community**, and **Top Learning**.

To earn points and climb the leaderboards, start performing different activities in the Mendix community. For example, let's say you have some time to spare while your app is deploying. You get a cup of coffee and check out the [Mendix Forum](http://forum.mendix.com). One questions pops out because you came across a similar problem a few weeks back. You decide to help the community member and post an answer to their question. Not long after, the author marks your answer as accepted. Boom! 15 points right there.

Check out the tables below for ways to earn points.

### 10.3 Social {#social}

Here you can connect  your social accounts for **GitHub**, **Meetup**, **Twitter**, **LinkedIn**, and **Skype**.

### 10.5 API Keys

In this section, you can view and create API keys that can be used by external applications to connect to the APIs of the Mendix Platform on behalf of your user account. These keys allow you to execute operations (or have them executed on your behalf) that require authentication but for which you do not want to pass your actual password. 

An example of this is to use an API key to perform scripted operations on your application model with the Platform SDK.

For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/) and [Mendix Platform SDK](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk).

### 10.6 Advanced

In this section, you can merge your accounts and select your profile visibility.

#### 10.6.2 Merging Your Accounts

With use of the Mendix Profile, you can merge your old Mendix account(s) into your current Mendix account. This action combines all your hard-earned points, certifications, and achievements in your efforts to climb the leaderboards.

All you have to do is make your profile public (see below), enter the email address of the account you want to merge with the account you are currently logged in to, and send a merge request.

We’ll take things from there!

{{% alert type="info" %}}
With this action, Mendix only combines the accounts. The old account is not deactivated. That should be done by the Company Admin.
