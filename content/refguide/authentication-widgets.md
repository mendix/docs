## 1 Introduction

Authentication widgets are used to sign users in and log them out. 

Use a [navigation profile setting](navigation#authentication) to direct users to the correct authentication page.

The **Authentication widgets** category contains the following widgets:

* [**Login id text box**](login-id-text-box) – allows users to provide a login id for authentication
* [**Password text box**](password-text-box) – allows users to provide a password for authentication
* [**Sign-in button**](sign-in-button) – sends a user’s login id and password to the server for authentication
* **Sign-out button** – signs the currently signed-in user out. The sign-out button is a button with an on-click event set to **Sign out**. For more information on on-click events, see the [On Click Event & Events Section](on-click-event). 
* [**Validation message**](validation-message) – informs a user about authentication failures if any
