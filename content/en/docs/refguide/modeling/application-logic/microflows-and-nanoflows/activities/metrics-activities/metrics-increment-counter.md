## 1 Introduction

The **Increment Counter** activity can be used to increment a metrics counter by one.

## 2 Properties

An example of increment counter properties is represented in the image below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/microflows-and-nanoflows/activities/metrics-activities/metrics-increment-counter/increment-counter-properties.png" alt="Increment Counter Properties" >}}

There are two sets of properties for this activity, those in the dialog box on the left, and those in the properties pane on the right.

The **Increment Counter** properties pane consists of the following sections:

* [Action](#action)
* [Common](#common)

## 3 Action Section {#action}

The **Action** section of the properties pane shows the action associated with this activity.

You can open a dialog box to configure this action by clicking the ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to the action.

You can also open the dialog box by double-clicking the activity in the microflow or right-clicking the activity and selecting **Properties**.

### 3.1 Name

The name of the counter whose value you want to increment by 1, which must adhere to the following rules:

* The name can only contain alpha-numeric characters, dots or underscores.
* The name must start with a letter.
* The name cannot start with `mx`, because this prefix is reserved for Mendix internal metrics.
* The name is case-insensitive.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
It is recommended to use a common prefix that uniquely defines your organisation and application.
{{% /alert %}}

### 3.2 Tags

You can specify a list of tags to enrich the counter name with key/value pairs. See [Tag Naming](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_tag_naming) on the Micrometer site for more guidance on using tags.
