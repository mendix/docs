## 1 Introduction

A placeholder can be used in two ways:

* In a [layout](layout) to define a "gap" that can be filled in a [page](page) based on that layout
* In a layout that defines the layout as a master layout

## 2 Common Properties

### 2.1 Name

The name of a placeholder is displayed in the center of each placeholder in the layout editor. Similarly, it will also appear in each placeholder gap of a page based on the layout, as long as the placeholder remains empty. 

The placeholder name is also used to map page contents from one layout to the other when switching layouts or creating a new page. For details on this behavior, see [Layout](layout).
