## 3 Upgrade Steps for a Sandbox Environment

If your app has a sandbox environment linked to it, you should follow the steps below.

### 3.1 Download a Backup

If your Free App is linked to a Sandbox environment you will first need to create a backup of your data that is stored in the Sandbox.

Please note that because you are going to unlink the Sandbox from your Free App, the Sandbox environment will be permanently deleted. This means that all data will be lost from the Sandbox/Free app. To keep your data, you need to create a backup.
