| Impact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Medium | Upgraded to TypeScript 1.8.x because of using new language features which are incompatible with TS 1.6.y, so you'll have to upgrade to TS 1.8.x (which is backward compatible) as well. |
| Low | Added support for Mendix 6.4.1. |
| Low | It is now possible to deep clone elements by using `element.deepCopy()`. |
| Low | `serializeToJs` no longer crashes when it encounters deleted attributes. |
| Low | Added `publicReadOnly` property for working copies. |
| Low | Added support for retrieving overviews of all the working copies that user is member of. |

SDK version 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 were unpublished because they were published in a broken state.
