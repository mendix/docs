### Class

The class property allows you to specify one or more cascading style sheet (CSS) classes that apply to the entire document and its contents. The classes should be separated by a space. The classes will be applied in the browser and can affect how a page is rendered. The classes should be classes in the project's theme.

<div class="alert alert-info">

Styling is applied in the following order:<br />
<br />
1) the default styling defined by the theme the project uses<br />
2) the `Class` property of the widget<br />
3) the `Style` property of the widget.

</div>

You can see which widgets in a page have styling applied via the class or style property by clicking the <strong>Show styles</strong> button.
