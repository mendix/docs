## 1 Introduction 

The Mendix Platform includes [Mendix Studio](/studio7/general/) in addition to [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide7/desktop-modeler/). Studio is a collaborative, no-code, web-based application development environment. It enables business developers and users with minimal coding or software development experience to create web and mobile applications without having to know how to code.

Studio enables you to do the following: 

* Develop application user interfaces with styled building blocks and widgets
* Create domain models for reading and writing data in an application
* Visually model the interactions and flow control of an application
* Leverage your enterprise design language to create engaging apps that conform to company standards beyond branding and theming
