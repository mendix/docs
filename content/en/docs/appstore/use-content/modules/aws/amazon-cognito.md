## Introduction

[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/cognito/) is a secure, scalable customer identity and access management platform. The [OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO](/appstore/modules/oidc/) module allows end-users of your Mendix app to login via Single Sign-on (SSO) using the OIDC protocol.

This how-to describes the steps required to enable your app to use the OIDC SSO module with Amazon Cognito as the identity provider.

## Configuring Amazon Cognito {#cognito-provider}

To configure Amazon Cognito for the OIDC SSO module, follow these steps:

1. Optional: If you are using the AWS test environment with Amazon Cognito set as the user pool, you must verify the email addresses by doing the following steps:
    1. In Amazon SES, click **Configuration** > **Verified identities**.
    2. On the **Verified identities** page, in the **Identities** section, click **Create identity**.
    3. Verify the email address or addresses that you want to use for the user pool

2. Create a user pool for Amazon Cognito by doing the following steps:
    1. In the Amazon Console, open the Amazon Cognito service.
    2. Select the region where you want to create the user pool, and then click **Create user pool**.
    3. Follow the **Create user pool** wizard to configure the sign-in and sign-up, security requirements, and message delivery.
    4. In the **Integrate your app** step of the wizard, enter a name for your user pool and leave the other settings as default.

    5. Review and create the user pool.

3. Add users to the user pool by doing the following steps:
    1. In Amazon Cognito, on the **User pools** page, find and open the user pool that you created.
    2. On the **Users** tab of the user pool, click **Create user**.
    3. Specify a verified email and a password.

4. Configure the app integration by doing the following steps:
    1. Go to the **App integration** tab of the user pool that you created.
    2. In the **App clients and analytics** section, click **Create app client**.

    3. On the **Create app client** page, configure the following settings:
        * **App type** - **Public client**
        * **App client name** - Enter a descriptive app client name
        * **Client secret** - Select **Generate a client secret**
        * **Authentication flows** - Select **ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH**
        * **Authentication flow session duration** - Enter a value from *3* to *15*
        * **Allowed callback URLs** - Enter a URL in the following format: `https://<your-app-url>/oauth/v2/callback`
        * **Allowed sign-out URLs** - This setting is optional, and you may leave it blank
        * **Identity providers** - Select **Cognito user pool**
        * **OAuth 2.0 grant types** - Select **Authorization code grant**
    4. Save your changes.
    5. Open the app client that you created.
    6. In the **App client information** section, copy the **Client ID** and the **Client secret**, and save them in a secure location.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/aws-cognito/idsecret.png" alt="The Client ID and Client secret on the App client information page" class="no-border" >}}

    7. Go back to the user pool that you created.
    8. On the **App integration** tab, in the **Domain** section, copy the **Cognito domain** and save it in a secure location.

## Configuring the Required Settings in Your Mendix App {#cognito}

After you configure the necessary settings in Amazon Cognito, you must add the endpoint URLs to your Mendix app, and then add a button to sign in with Amazon Cognito.

1. In your Mendix app, configure a new OIDC client, as described in [OIDC SSO: Runtime Configuration of Your IdP at Your App](/appstore/modules/oidc/#runtime-idp-app). Make sure to configure the following settings:
    * **Alias** - Enter a descriptive name to identify your app
    * **Client ID** - Enter the app client ID that you obtained from the user pool in Amazon Cognito
    * **Client secret** - Enter the client secret that you obtained from the user pool in Amazon Cognito
    * **Client authentication method** - Select **client_secret_post**
    * **Automatic Configuration URL** - Enter a URL in the following format: `https://cognito-idp.{the region where you created the user pool}.amazonaws.com/{your user pool ID}/.well-known/openid-configuration`

    For more information, see [User pool OIDC and hosted UI API endpoints reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html).

2. Click **Import Configuration** to automatically fill the other endpoints.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/aws-cognito/filledendpoints.png" alt="Sample endpoint URLs" class="no-border" >}}

3. Click **Save**.
4. Add an Amazon Cognito sign in button to a page in your app.

    You can achieve this by adding the **ACT_StartWebSignIn_Default** nanoflow to the button. For more information about creating custom buttons, see [Creating a Custom Save Button with a Microflow](/refguide/creating-a-custom-save-button/).

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/aws-cognito/samplelogin.png" alt="Sample endpoint URLs" class="no-border" >}}

Users who are part of the user pool you created in Amazon Cognito can now log in with their Amazon Cognito user name and password.
