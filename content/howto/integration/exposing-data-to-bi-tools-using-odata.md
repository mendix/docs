## 1 Introduction

Mendix apps encourage the application of a services-oriented architecture, with multiple smaller services providing APIs and user interfaces for a specific set of data and logic. Enterprises build up complete solutions by assembling these services.

One important aspect of services is that all access to data and logic is handled by the service operations. Direct access to databases used for storing the service data is discouraged, because this would bypass the business rules and security handled by the service. This creates a challenge for generic reporting, data warehousing, and ETL tooling.

A new standard called OData being adopted more and more, as this enables generic data access within a services-oriented architecture. [OData](http://www.odata.org) is “an open protocol to allow the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable Restful APIs in a simple and standard way.". In other words, it enables tools to use any REST/OData service by providing metadata that describes the data being provided and by standardizing the messages exchanged with the OData services.

A reporting tool like Tableau or Excel can discover what data and functionality is available in an OData service and provide a generic way for users to build new queries for the data.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a published OData service with resources
* Add the OData server to Tableau and Excel
* Combine resources in Tableau
* Create custom queries

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Open the [Company Expenses sample app](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/240/Mendix/Company-Expenses) from the Mendix App Store in the Modeler
    * Add some expense reports to the app so that you have data to work with in this how-to
* Install Excel 2013
* Download and install [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/) (you can use the trial version for 14 days)

## 3 Creating a Published OData Service

A published OData service can be used by third-party applications to read data from a Mendix application. In this chapter, you will create and configure such a service.

1. Open the Modeler and add a new folder to the **Expenses** folder called **OData Services**.
2. Right-click the OData Service folder and select **Add** > **Published services** > **Published OData service**:

3.  Enter the name **Expenses** and click **OK**.

    ![](attachments/18448736/18582027.png)

4.  Go to the Resources tab and click **Add published resource**:

    ![](attachments/18448736/18581979.png)

5. In the **Edit published resource** window, you can select an **Entity** as the data source for the OData service. Security in OData is managed by the project security settings and the entity level access rules; therefore, if you have already configured access rules in your app, you don't have to configure it separately for OData.

    Click **Select**:

6. In the **Select Entity** window, select the **Expense** entity and click **Select**:

    ![](attachments/18448736/18582024.png)

7. In the **Edit published resource** window, do the following:
    * Change the **Exposed entity name** to *Expenses*:
    * Click **Select** for **Exposed attributes and associations**

    ![](attachments/18448736/18581977.png)

8. In the **Select members for entity** window, select what values are exposed in the OData service, then click **OK** to save the resource:

    ![](attachments/18448736/18581982.png)

9. Repeat steps 4–8 for the **ExpenseType** and **Employee** entities:

## 6 Filtering Data With Query Parameters

By default all the expenses are retrieved by Tableau, but Mendix allows you to add filters to the query so only the desired data is being retrieved.

To filter data with query parameters, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the **Expenses** data source and select **Edit Data Source...**:

    ![](attachments/18448736/18582001.png)

2. Click the OData URL to change the connection settings:

    ![](attachments/18448736/18582000.png)

3. Add `?$top=3` to the server URL (in order to only retrieve the first three expenses) and click **OK**:

    ![](attachments/18448736/18581998.png)

4. Open sheet1, where you should now see a stacked bar chart with only the data of the three expenses:

    ![](attachments/18448736/18581997.png)

5. You can combine filters by using the `&` character. Repeat steps 1–4, but now use `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses?$skip=3&$top=3` as the server URL. You should now see a stacked bar chart showing the data of expenses four to six.

These are some other query examples:

* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses(1688849860265137)`
* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses?$top=100`
* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses?$skip=10&$ top=10`
* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses/$count`
* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses?$filter=Firstname+eq+'Ivan'`
* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses?$filter=Firstname+ne+'Ivan'`
* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses?$filter=DateOfBirth+gt+datetime'1995-01-01T00:00:00'`
* `http://localhost:8080/odata/Expenses/Expenses?$filter=DateOfBirth+gt+datetime'2005-01-01T00:00:00'&$orderby=DateOfBirth`
