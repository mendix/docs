Depending on the Mendix version used to build your app, you have to use a different version of Make It Native. Please note that you can use the Make It Native 9 app until 10.5.x. We updated the app's React Native in 10.6, resulting in a changed MIN app version.

Mendix offers the following apps for you to view and test your native mobile apps:

* [Make It Native 10 App](/releasenotes/mobile/make-it-native-10/) – use this with [Studio Pro 10.6.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/) and higher
* [Make It Native 9 App](/releasenotes/mobile/make-it-native-9/) – use this with versions from [Studio Pro 9.24.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.24/) to [10.5.x](https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.5/)
* [Make It Native 8 App](/releasenotes/mobile/make-it-native-app/) – use this with [Studio Pro 8.18.x](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.18/)
