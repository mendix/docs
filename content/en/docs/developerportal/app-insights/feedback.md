## 1 Introduction

If your app uses the [Mendix Feedback](/appstore/modules/mendix-feedback/) module, users can report feedback to your team using the feedback widget in your app, and all their feedback will go to the **Feedback** page. **Feedback** enables your team to view all the feedback. It also allows team members with the right permissions to organize feedback and add feedback manually. 

You can access the **Feedback** page by selecting your app in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/) and then clicking **Feedback** in the navigation pane. 

The **Feedback** page contains two tabs: [Inbox](#inbox) and [Archive](#archive).

### 1.1 What Happens to a User After They Submit Feedback? {#what-happens-to-user}

#### 1.1.1 What Happens to Your Team

After a user reports feedback in the app using the feedback widget, the feedback goes automatically to the [Inbox](#inbox) on the **Feedback** page, and the members in your team who are a Scrum Master or have the same permissions as the default permissions of a Scrum Master will get a [notification](/developerportal/global-navigation/#notifications). If you no longer want to receive feedback notifications for a specific app, you can [stop watching](/developerportal/#my-apps) the app. 

Next to getting a notification in the Mendix Portal, Scrum Masters of your team will also receive an email with a link to the details of the new feedback.

#### 1.1.2 What Happens to the User

After a user reports feedback in the app using the feedback widget, the user will get an email with a link to their submitted feedback. When the user opens the link, a page opens and shows their feedback details. See the table below:

| What a User Can See on the Page                             | What a User Cannot See on the Page                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name of the feedback they submitted                         | Metadata                                                    |
| Description of the feedback they wrote                      | Summary of the feedback that your team wrote                |
| Screenshot (if they uploaded a screenshot for the feedback) | To which team member the feedback is assigned               |
| Current status of the feedback                              | Tags that are assigned to the feedback                      |
| Submission date                                             | Other feedback items that are associated with this feedback |
| Last activity on the feedback                               | Attachments that you team uploaded for this feedback        |
|                                                             | Team comments on this feedback                              |

This page also has a message feature for the user to communicate with your team directly. Users can upload images in the messages. When the user posts a message, the assigned team member will receive an email. When there is a reply from your team, the user will get an email notification.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}Do not share the link to feedback details with someone unless it is necessary. Anyone who has this link can access the feedback details, including the title and the description of the feedback as well as the screenshot if there is one.{{% /alert %}}

If the user does not want to receive notifications anymore, they can clear the checkbox for the notification on the page, as shown in the image below: 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/app-insights/feedback/user-notification.png" class="no-border" >}}

## 2 Inbox {#inbox}

On the **Inbox** tab, everyone from your team can view all the unarchived feedback sent from your app by users.  

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/app-insights/feedback/feedback-items.png" alt="inbox tab" >}}

In the list on the **Inbox** tab, you can find the following information for each feedback:

* **ID** – the unique number that is assigned to the feedback
* **Subject** – the title of the feedback given by the reporter
* **Submitter** – the email address of the reporter
* **Tags** – tags that your team has assigned to the feedback
* **Status** – the status that your team has set to the feedback

{{% alert color="info" %}}For more information about each bullet item above, see the list in the [Feedback Details](#feedback-details) section.{{% /alert %}}

To export all feedback into one CSV file, click **Export**.

To search by **Subject**, **Description**, **User Email** and **Tags**, type the keywords in the search bar.

Clicking the filter bar will open the **Filter by** side panel. In this side panel, you can filter feedback using the **Environment**, **Assignee**, **Priority**, **Status**, and **Submission date**. The filters are saved until the page is refreshed.

### 2.1 Organizing Feedback in Inbox

If your [role](/developerportal/general/app-roles/) has the permission that **Can edit ‘Stories, Documents and Feedback'**, you can also organize feedback items.

You can add new feedback manually yourself. 

To manually add feedback, click **Create new feedback** (if there is not any feedback yet on the **Inbox** tab) or click **Add feedback** (if there is already feedback on the **Inbox** tab), and then fill in the **Subject**, **Description**, and **Submitter Email** fields, and optionally **Upload Screenshots** in the **New Feedback** dialog box.

If you select feedback, you can see the following items: 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/app-insights/feedback/bulk-actions-bar.png" alt="bulk-actions-bar" >}}

* **Link** – Clicking this links the feedback together into one feedback group.

  You need to choose which item is the primary item of the group. After the feedback items are linked, only the primary feedback item appears in the list. The feedback items that are linked to the primary item will disappear from the list. You can only access these linked feedback items from their primary item. If you change the status of the primary feedback item, all the linked items will get the same status automatically.

  {{% alert color="info" %}}When you open a linked feedback, you can click **Make [the linked feedback] the Primary feedback** to make this feedback the primary feedback of the feedback group instead.{{% /alert %}}

* **Move** – Clicking this moves the selected feedback to any other app of which you are a member. Whenever you move feedback, you will also move all linked feedback. If you only want to move one feedback item, you need to unlink the feedback from the group first.

* **Create Stories** – If your app is connected to [Epics](/developerportal/project-management/epics/) or [Jira](/developerportal/project-management/jira-connector/), clicking this button will convert the selected feedback to stories on the designated board in Epics or Jira.

* Status drop-down list – You can select a status from the drop-down list and then click **Apply** to change the status of the selected feedback.

* **Archive** – Clicking this sets the selected feedback as archived.

* **Delete** – Clicking this deletes the selected feedback permanently. The result is irreversible.

## 3 Archive {#archive}

On the **Archive** tab, everyone in your team can view all the archived feedback.

In the list on the **Archive** tab, you can find the following information for each feedback:

* **ID** – the unique number that is assigned to the feedback
* **Subject** – the title of the feedback given by the reporter
* **Submitter** – the email address of the reporter
* **Tags** – tags that your team has assigned to the feedback
* **Status** – the status that your team has set to the feedback
* **Date** – the date when the feedback was submitted
* **Archive Date** – the date when the feedback was archived

To export all the archived feedback into one CSV file, click **Export**.

To search by **Subject** and **ID**, type the keywords in the search bar.

Clicking the filter bar will open the **Filter by** side panel. In this side panel, you can filter the feedback using the **Environment**, **Closed date**, **Submission date**, and **Assignees**. The filters are saved until the page is refreshed.

## 4 Opening Feedback in Inbox or Archive{#feedback-details}

On the [Inbox](#inbox) and [Archive](#archive) tabs, you can open feedback by clicking it in the list. If you click the **ID** of the feedback, the feedback details page will open. If you click a place other than the **ID** of the feedback, a side panel will open. Either the feedback details page or the side panel contains two tabs: [Feedback](#feedback) and [Contact Reporter](#contact-reporter).

### 4.1 Feedback Tab {#feedback}

When multiple feedback items are linked, the system only sends an email to the reporter of this specific feedback item, not other associated feedback items in the same group.
