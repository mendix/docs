## 1 Introduction

A Mendix app consists of app-level documents and a number of modules. Each module can contain many documents. At the app level, there are some settings and documents that apply to your app as a whole. For example, navigation is an app-level document; the menu bar is app-wide and can refer to functionality in all modules. Most documents, however, live at the level of a [module](modules).

## 2 Settings

App settings include the languages for the end-user, app directory and database and server settings.

See [App Settings](project-settings).

## 3 Security

At the app level you can change the security level, manage user roles and manage administrator and anonymous user access.

See [App Security](project-security).

## 4 Navigation

In navigation you can configure the menu bar and navigation tree for your application. Also you can specify what the home page is, as in, the page you see right after signing in.

See [Navigation](navigation).

## 5 System Texts

System texts are texts like information and error messages that are produced by the server or the client. You can translate these texts so that they appear in the preferred language of the user.

See [System Texts](system-texts).
