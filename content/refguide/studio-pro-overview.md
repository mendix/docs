## 1 Introduction

Mendix Studio Pro is the tool for creating, viewing, and editing your Mendix applications. A Mendix app is called a [project](project) in Studio Pro. A project consists of many documents that are grouped in [modules](modules) and folders. There are some project-level settings, but the core of the functionality is inside the modules. Examples of documents are [project settings](project-settings), [domain models](domain-model), [pages](pages), and [microflows](microflows). One Studio Pro instance can have only one project open at a time, but you can open two Studio Pro instances when necessary.

This documentation describes the graphical user interface of Studio Pro. The rest of the documentation follows the structure of the project explorer.

## 2 Document Tabs

The documents you view and edit are shown in tabs. You can have a number of tabs open, just like in a modern web browser. They can be closed, reordered, and shown side by side. Each document has its own save state, history, and future, so undo and redo actions are unlimited.

## 3 Menus

In the Studio Pro top bar, you can see several menus, such as [Edit](edit-menu), [View](view-menu), or [Version Control](version-control-menu) menus. Each menu contains menu items that allow you to perform various actions, for example, to [create a deployment package](create-deployment-package-dialog), set [preferences](preferences-dialog), or view the [Errors](errors-pane) pane. 

For more information on menus, see [Menus](menus).
