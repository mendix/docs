## 1 Introduction

The download-file action can be used to enable the browser to download a specific file. The user gets a download popup or the file is shown directly in the browser.

See [Microflow Element Common Properties](/refguide7/microflow-element-common-properties/) for properties that all activities share (for example, caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.

On mobile devices files are always shown in a browser window.

{{% /alert %}}

Many browsers implement popup blockers preventing windows to be opened noninteractively, such as through a Microflow. For mobile devices this means that triggering downloads from a Microflow is only possible after disabling the popup blocker. You could consider using a FileManager widget to let the user initiate the download manually.
