A WSDL file can contain multiple services. A service can contain multiple ports. Upon loading a WSDL, a dialog will ask you to select a port for each service if a service contains multiple ports.

### Services

This part contains the services to be found in the WSDL.

* Name is the name of the service.
* Port is selected port in multiple-port service.
* Location is where the service is located.
* Location constant can be used to add additional locations for a service, for example: the URL of the soap service may change when moving from a development to a production environment. See also [Constants](/refguide7/constants/).

If there is a multiple-port service defined in the WSDL, a dialog will pop up that allows the user to select which one of the ports to use_._

### Operations

This part contains all the operations found in the WSDL. You can expand the list and see additional information about individual operations in the right pane.

### Advanced Settings

* Send binary data as attachment (MTOM) - enable or disable MTOM: the *Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism*, a method of efficiently sending binary data to and from Web services. Read more about it at [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-mtom/). Please note that message optimization will only be applied when you use one or more export mappings to create the request body in the Call web service action.
