There are two sets of properties for this activity, those in the dialog box on the left, and those in the properties pane on the right.

The **Call workflow** properties pane consists of the following sections:

* [Action](#action)

The **Action** section of the properties pane shows the action associated with this activity.

You can open a dialog box to configure this action by clicking the ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to the action.

### 3.1 Workflow {#workflow}
