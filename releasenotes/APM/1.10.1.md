## Mendix 7 Compatibility

This is the first version that is also available for Mendix 7. Due to some incompatibilities between 6 and 7, there are now two packages available in the Mendix App Store. The standard package to download is the Mendix 7 package. Under older versions, you can find the same version packaged for Mendix 6.

With the release of Mendix 7, the Mendix documentation changed, and the help links in APM pointed to the wrong location. This has been fixed.

## Bug fixes

* In the creation of a trigger in a measurement with a query as the source, the created trigger was connected to the parameter (or so it seemed in the UI). This has been fixed to work as expected.

* A range validation in the BaseTrigger entity that was on the TriggerContinuationPaused Boolean and should have been on TriggerContinuationDelay has been fixed.
