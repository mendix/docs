Not every element in a microflow has all of these properties.

## Common Properties

### Caption

The caption describes to the human user what happens in this element. Captions of action activities can be auto-generated by the Modeler. See below.

### Auto-generate caption

The auto-generate caption property specifies whether the caption is automatically generated based on the type of activity.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | The caption of the activity is generated by the Modeler. |
| No | You can edit the caption yourself in the Caption property. |

_Default value_: Yes

### Background color

Here you can choose a background color for the activity. Colors do not influence execution; they are only used for documentation. For example, you can make error handling code red so you can easily identify it.
