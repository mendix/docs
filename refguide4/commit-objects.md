This action can commit one or more objects. For persistent entities this means that the object will be stored in the database. Committing non-persistable entities stores the current attribute values and association values in memory, this allows a rollback to revert to those values. See also [Persistability](persistability).

See [Microflow Element Common Properties](microflow-element-common-properties) for properties that all activities share (e.g. caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.

## Input Properties

### Variable

The object or list of objects that you want to commit.

## Action Properties

### With events

Indicates whether or not to execute the commit event handlers of the objects.

### Refresh in client

Indicates whether or not to refresh the objects in the client.

When committing a large number of objects, we recommend that you do not enable 'refresh in client' because it can slow things down.
