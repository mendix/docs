This action can commit one or more objects. For persistable entities this means that the object will be stored in the database. Committing non-persistable entities stores the current attribute values and association values in memory, this allows a rollback to revert to those values. See also [Persistability](persistability).

See [Microflow Element Common Properties](microflow-element-common-properties) for properties that all activities share (e.g. caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.
