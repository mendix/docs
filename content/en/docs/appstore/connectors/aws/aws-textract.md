## 1 Introduction

The [Amazon Textract](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/205646) connector provides a way for you to enrich your Mendix app with the capability to extract text, handwriting and data from documents by implementing [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/).

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Amazon Textract helps improve your app by giving you the tools to extract data from documents in a structured manner. For example, you can use it to extract business data from handwritten documents, or patient data from intake forms.

### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The Amazon Textract connector requires Mendix Studio Pro 9.18.0 or above.

To authenticate with Amazon Web Service (AWS), you must also install and configure the [AWS authentication connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333). For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

### 1.4 Limitations

Because of a synchronous invocation limitation of the Amazon Textract service, the Amazon Textract connector only supports scanning a single page at a time. This limitation will be removed in future versions of the connector.

## 2 Installation

Follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/) to import the Amazon Textract connector into your app.

## 3 Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonTextractConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon Textract. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### 3.1 Configuring AWS Authentication

In order to use the Amazon Textract service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

1. Ensure that you have installed and configured the AWS Authentication connector, as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. Decide whether you want to use session or static credentials to authenticate.
    The Amazon Textract connector supports both session and static credentials. By default, the connector is pre-configured to use static credentials, but you may want to switch to session credentials, for example, to increase the security of your app. For an overview of both authentication methods, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).
3. In the **App Explorer**, double-click the **Settings** for your app.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-textract/textract_open_settings.png" alt="The Settings option in the App Explorer">}}

4. In the **App Settings** dialog, in the **Configurations** tab, edit or create an authentication profile.
    If you have multiple sets of AWS credentials, or if you want to use both static and session credentials for different use cases, create separate authentication profiles for each set of credentials.
5. In the **Edit Configuration** dialog, in the **Constants** tab, click **New** to add the constants required for the configuration.
6. In the **Select Constants** dialog, find and expand the **AmazonTextractConnector** > **ConnectionDetails** section.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-textract/textract_edit_configuration.png" alt="The SessionCredentials and StaticCredentials items in the ConnectionDetails section">}}

7. Depending on your selected authentication type, configure the required parameters for the **StaticCredentials** or **SessionCredentials**.

    | Credentials type | Constant | Value |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Any | **UseStaticCredentials** | **true** if you want to use static credentials, or **false** for session credentials |
    | **StaticCredentials** | **AccessKey** | Access key ID [created in IAM](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites)  |
    | **StaticCredentials** | **SecretKey** | Secret key [created in IAM](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Role ARN** | [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the AWS role that the connector should assume |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Profile ARN** | ARN of the profile [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Trust Anchor ARN** | ARN of the trust anchor [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Client Certificate Identifier** | The **Client Certificate Pin** visible in the **Outgoing Certificates** section on the **Network** tab in the Mendix Cloud environment |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Duration** | Duration for which the session token should be valid; after the duration passes, the validity of the session credentials expires |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Session Name** | An identifier for the session |
    
### 3.2 Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After setting up the authentication, to analyze a document, implement the [AnalyzeDocument](#analyzedocument) activity by doing the following steps:

1. In the **Domain Model**, right-click on the work area, and then click **Add entity**.
2. Enter a name for your entity, for example, *Document*, and then click **OK**.
