## 1 Introduction

Coming home with sore hands from using the mouse too much during the day is uncomfortable. This how-to teaches you how to use the mouse more efficiently while modeling a Mendix app.

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Generate a submicroflow from selected actions
* Drag a microflow or a page into a microflow

## 2 Prerequisites

None.

## 3 Generating a Submicroflow from Selected Actions

If possible, re-using logic is an important procedure while developing apps. The actions that form the reusable logic can be selected and turned into a submicroflow. This just takes two clicks, as shown in this animation:

## 4 Dragging a Page into a Microflow

Dragging an existing form from the Project Explorer reduces the amount of mouse clicks and mouse pointer hovering:

## 5 Dragging a Microflow into a Microflow

Instead of creating a new submicroflow action, it can be easier to drag an existing microflow into the current one.
