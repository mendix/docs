An operation has the following properties:

## General

### WSDL Name

### Documentation

### Microflow

Defines which microflow will be executed when this webservice is called.

## Parameters

### Name

Defines the name of the parameter in the microflow

### Type

Defines which type the parameter is, for example a List of Vehicle.

### Optional

Defines whether this parameter is optional in the webservice call.

### WSDL Name

## Return value

This section pertains to the return value of the microflow and how it is transformed back to XML.

### Type

### WSDL name

The name of the return type. This determines the output element name in the XML that results from a webservice call.
