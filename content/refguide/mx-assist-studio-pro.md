## 1 Introduction 

Mendix Assist is an artificial intelligence-powered agent that helps you configure microflows in Mendix Studio Pro. It gives you recommendations on configuring the next step of your microflow based on activities, parameters, and events that already exist in the microflow.

Mendix Assist was built using the machine learning analysis of over twelve million anonymized application flows built with Mendix. Mendix uses deep learning to detect best practice patterns in microflows. Based on these patterns, Mendix Assist predicts the best options for the next activity in a microflow. Moreover, Mendix Assist keeps learning by analyzing new microflows being built.  

## 2 Mendix Assist Overview

Mendix Assist is enabled by default and is displayed as a blue dot in the flow of a [microflow](microflows). A bow-tie appears on the dot when you hover over it.

It is possible to add activities in the regular way without using Mendix Assist.

Click the bow-tie to see Mendix Assist recommendations:

Mendix Assist lists the top five recommendations, starting with the most probable, for the current microflow. Click the suggestion to proceed with it and insert it into a microflow. For more information, see the [Adding Activities and Elements with Mendix Assist](#add-activities) section below.

Once you have selected an activity or an event to insert to the microflow using Mendix Assist, the **Properties** dialog box will appear for configuring this activity/event.

## 3 Settings

To open the settings of Mendix Assist, click **Edit** > **Preference**. In the **General** tab, you can see the Mendix **Assist** section:

Mendix Assist has the following properties:

* **Enable Mendix Assist** – switches Mendix Assist on and off
* **Show suggestions for system variables** – when enabled, Mendix Assist will make suggestions for system objects as well (for example, it can suggest that you change such objects as **currentUser** or **currentSession**)

## 4 Adding Activities & Elements with Mendix Assist {#add-activities}

You can add various activities and elements using Mendix Assist. 

To add an activity/element do the following:

1. Click the blue Mendix Assist dot in a microflow.
2. Browse the suggestions and select the activity you need.
3. Click the selected activity to add it to the flow.
4. Configure the activity's properties to avoid consistency errors.

The activity/element is then added to the flow.

For example, when you select **Add a decision**, a [decision](decision) will be added:

If you do not see the activity or element you would like to add in the suggestions, click **Add other element** and choose an activity, loop, decision, merge, or object type decision.
