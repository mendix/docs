### 1.1 Introduction

Mendix Atlas UI is the design framework that makes building elegant user experiences a rapid process. It was built upon three design principles – simplicity, harmony, and flexibility. Simplicity helps you focus on what is important. We’ve simplified the design process with readymade page templates, building blocks, and widgets that can be arranged and customized to suit your app. Our design elements are harmonious, bringing a unified aesthetic to your app landscape. Atlas is built to be fully responsive, ensuring quality across scale without losing functionality. Visit the [Atlas UI site](https://atlas.mendix.com/) for detailed previews and descriptions of all Atlas UI elements.

### 1.2 Web Modeler

The Mendix Web Modeler brings the collaborative Mendix platform to the browser, making it easier than ever to share and collaborate on application models. Every app built in the Web Modeler is styled with the Atlas UI Framework. Try the Atlas UI Starter App and get running in minutes.

### 1.3 Design principles
Atlas UI has a philosophy based on three core principles. These principles guide all our design decisions at Mendix, and we encourage every Mendix user to adopt them when building their own apps.

#### Simplicity
Freedom from complexity, we strive for simplicity to help you focus on what is important.

#### Harmony
Create familiarity and consistency throughout your apps landscape, regardless of the device you use.

#### Flexibility
Design apps that look good and scale in all situations without losing an intuitive and consistent experience.

## 2 Design Elements

Our UI library is fully integrated into the Mendix Web Modeler. After choosing a navigation layout in the modeler, you can find page templates, building blocks, and widgets directly in your toolbox. These UI elements form the foundation of your app.

1. **Navigation Layouts**

When building a Mendix App, the first thing you do is choose a navigation layout. These layouts are the frame within which your dynamic pages are housed, and provide consistent structure throughout your app.

2. **Page Templates**

Page templates are pre-designed collections of building blocks that can be used as-is, or can be enhanced with custom building blocks and widgets.

3. **Building Blocks**

Building blocks are single-purpose user interface elements, comprised of multiple widgets. Multiple building blocks are usually used together on one page.

4. **Widgets**

Widgets are small user interface elements (alerts, buttons, charts, etc.) used to enhance existing building blocks.

5. **Design Properties**

You can further customize widgets by changing their design properties. Colors, text, and many other variables can be altered to make the widget what you need it to be.
