A menu document defines a navigation menu that can be used by a [menu widget](/refguide7/menu-widgets/). Typically the main menus for your application are defined in [device types](/refguide7/desktop-profile/), while you use menu documents for auxiliary menus, for example, a side bar.

A menu consists of a list of menu items, which optionally contain sub-items. Depending on the widget a number of levels are allowed.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

If [security](/refguide7/project-security/) is enabled, the menu will only show items that the user has access to.

{{% /alert %}}
