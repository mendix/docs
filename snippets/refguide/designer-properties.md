The size of a page as displayed in the page editor can be controlled through two properties.

**Canvas Width**

This defines the width in pixels of the page in the page editor.

Default: *800*

**Canvas Height**

This defines the preferred minimum height in pixels of the page in the page editor.

Default: *600*

These properties only change what is seen in the editor. They have no effect on the actual application.
