## 1 Introduction

This chapter describes the uninstallation of the APM tool. The optional in this chapter means you need to verify if this option was chosen during the install before undoing it.

## 2 Backup

Did you commit your work to the team server? And did you make a database backup?

## 7 Optional: Revert After Startup & Before Shutdown

Remove the microflow call action to APMAgent\USE_ME\AfterStartup from an after startup microflow. This feature is runtime configurable and by default none of the tools are started.
Remove the microflow call action to APMAgent\USE_ME\BeforeShutdown from a before shutdown microflow.
You can find the AfterStartup and BeforeShutdown microflows in the project settings.
