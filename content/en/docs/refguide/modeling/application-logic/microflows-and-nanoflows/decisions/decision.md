## 1 Introduction

A decision is an element that makes a choice based on a condition and follows one and only one of the outgoing sequence flows. For example, you need to use a decision to show different order forms for the customers with different grades, or to prevent a blocked customer from making orders.

## 2 Properties

An example of decision properties is represented in the image below:

The decision properties pane consists of the following sections:

* [Common](#common)

### 2.1 Common {#common}

#### 2.1.1 Caption

For more information, see the [Caption](/refguide/microflow-element-common-properties/#caption) section in *Common Properties*.

#### 2.1.2 Decision Type

**Decision type** defines whether an expression or a rule is used to define conditions of the decision. Possible decision types are described in the table below:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Expression](#expression) | Expressions can be used to create or change an object or a variable based on logic. |
| [Rule](#rule) | A rule is a special kind of microflow, the outcomes of which can be used in a decision instead of calling a sub-microflow and using the return variable of that sub-microflow. The idea is that complicated decisions can be consolidated in rules and reused in various places. |

##### 2.1.2.1 Expression {#expression}

If the **Type** property is set to **Expression**, the expression entered here is used to define the condition of the decision. For more information on expressions, see [Microflow Expressions](/refguide/expressions/).

The expression should result in a Boolean or an enumeration. 

For the expression resulting in a Boolean, two flows are possible: **true** and **false**. For example, you can use the expression resulting in a Boolean if you want to check whether a customer's email is verified or not.

The number of conditions available for the enumeration type depends on the corresponding enumeration values. There is also the *empty* condition available for enumeration: if the enumeration parameter or an attribute of an object is unassigned, the sequence flow with the caption **(empty)** is followed.

If you want to open a different order form per customer grade you can use a decision. The microflow parameter is *Customer*. Depending on what grade the customer has, a different sequence flow is followed and a different order form is opened. If an end-user needs to select a customer grade but does not do that, the flow labelled **(empty)** is followed and an error message is shown to the end-user.

Since you want to go in a different direction for each value of the enumeration, you only need to use the attribute containing the enumeration. So the expression in the example above is`$Customer/Grade`. 

##### 2.2.2.2 Rule {#rule}

If the **Type** property is set to **Rule**, a [rule](/refguide/rules/) can be selected to define the condition of the decision. You can use the outcome of the rule for the decision instead of calling a sub-microflow and using the return variable of that sub-microflow.

The properties of the **Rule** decision type are the following ones:

* **Rule** – allows you to select a rule.

* **Parameter** – for each parameter of the rule an argument needs to be specified using [expressions](/refguide/expressions/). For example, a rule that determines whether a customer deserves a certain status will have a customer object as a parameter.
