## 1 What Is the Developer Portal?

The [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com) is one of the three key components of the Mendix Platform. The other two are [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling) and [Mendix Studio](/studio/). In the Developer Portal, Mendix developers can collaborate, deploy, and manage their apps, and manage their company and users. 

The Developer Portal also offers open, well-defined APIs, enabling third-party developers to integrate their own widgets and plugins. For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/).
