## Introduction

The look of individual **Charts** widgets can be fine tuned with advanced settings. A theme allows developers to create global settings that apply to all charts. In this way color, language, font and many more things can be set for all the charts in an app.

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Change the font style for all charts
* Add a theme configuration

## Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Download the latest [Chart Widget](/appstore/widgets/charts/) from the Mendix Marketplace
* Set up a chart: see [How to create a charts](/howto/front-end/charts-basic-create/)

## Creating a Chart Theme

This is how the original chart looks:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/charts-tutorials/charts-advanced-tuning/charts-toggle-editor.png" alt="chart" class="no-border" >}}

### Creating an Advanced Custom Configuration

To create the required custom configuration easily, follow these steps:

1. Open the app with the chart (or charts).
1. Open a page with a chart.
1. Open the chart settings.
1. Go to the tab **Advanced**.
1. Set the **Mode** to **Developer**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/charts-tutorials/charts-advanced-tuning/charts-widget-properties-advanced.png" alt="chart widget properties" class="no-border" >}}

1. Run the app.
1. Open the page with the chart in the browser.
1. Click the **Toggle Editor** button.
1. In the **Layout** section add the **Custom settings**.

    ```json
    {
      "font": {
        "family": "Open Sans",
        "size": 14,
        "color": "#555"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Change the font settings, till the chart shows the required font.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/charts-tutorials/charts-advanced-tuning/charts-toggle-editor-open.png" alt="chart editor" class="no-border" >}}

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}Please note that the editor changes will not persist. They need to be stored in the advanced settings of the widget or stored in the theme.{{% /alert %}}

1. In Studio Pro, set **Mode** in the chart to **Advanced**, to remove the Toggle Editor button.

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}Please note that the theme settings only apply to charts in Advanced or Developer mode.{{% /alert %}}

### Adding a Theme Configuration

To add a theme file which will apply to all charts in the app, follow these steps:

1. From Studio Pro, go to the menu **App** > **Show App Directory in Explorer**.
1. Open the **theme** folder.
1. Create a new file: *com.mendix.charts.json*

    {{% alert color="info" %}}Please note that<br/>
    * the file name is case sensitive<br/>
    * the file extension is `json`<br/>
    * the file must contain a *json* object, even if this is empty â€” for example `{ }`
    {{% /alert %}}

### Changing the Font Globally

To change the font in all charts in the app, follow these steps:

1. Edit the *[app folder]/theme/com.mendix.charts.json* file in a plain text editor.
1. Replace or update the content. In the **layout** section, place the style changes that were created in the first section of this how to.

    ```json
    {
      "layout": {
        "font": {
          "family": "Impact",
          "size": 20,
          "color": "#4682B4"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Restart the Mendix app.
1. Validate the expected result.
