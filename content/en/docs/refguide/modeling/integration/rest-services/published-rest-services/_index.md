## 1 Introduction

Add a [published REST service](/refguide/published-rest-service/) to expose your entities and microflows to other apps using the REST standard.

## 2 Published REST Service

For an overview of the available options when you add a published service, see [Published REST Service](/refguide/published-rest-service/).

You can easily expose an entity via REST by right-clicking the entity in the [domain model](/refguide/domain-model/) and selecting [Expose as REST resource](/refguide/generate-rest-resource/).

To publish a microflow as a REST operation, right-click anywhere in the editor and select [Publish as REST service operation](/refguide/publish-microflow-as-rest-operation/).

## 3 Authentication {#authorization}

Published REST services can be secured with basic authentication, active session authentication and custom authentication. Basic and active session authentication are the default, and are automatically applied when you set the [security level](/refguide/app-security/) of your app to **Prototype / demo**  or **Production**.

If you don't want basic authentication, there are three options:

* You can choose to have [no authentication](/refguide/published-rest-service/#authentication) for specific published REST services.
* When you [allow anonymous users](/refguide/app-security/#anonymous-users) to your app, published REST services become available without authentication. This only applies if the anonymous user has been selected for the allowed roles for the published service, and **Username and password** has been selected as the authentication method.
* You can implement [custom authentication using a microflow](/refguide/published-rest-service/#authentication-microflow).

For more details, see [Published REST Routing](/refguide/published-rest-routing/) and the [Requires Authentication](/refguide/published-rest-service/#authentication) section in *Published REST Service*.

## 4 Documentation {#interactive-documentation}

Every [published REST service](/refguide/published-rest-service/) is automatically documented. This documentation is available in the app under `http://yourapp.com/rest-doc/`. Each service has an interactive documentation page using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/). You can interact with the service to see how it behaves.

The documentation of the services is available in the [OpenAPI 3.0](/refguide/open-api/) and [OpenAPI 2.0](/refguide/open-api-2/) formats, which is readable by many systems and tools. It contains [JSON Schemas](/refguide/published-rest-service-json-schema/) for the messages definitions.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Exporting OpenAPI documentation in version 3.0 of the specification was introduced in Studio Pro [10.1.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.1/).

## 5 Logging

To log detailed information about interaction with your published REST service, [set the log level](/refguide/logging/) of the **REST Publish** log node to **Trace**.
