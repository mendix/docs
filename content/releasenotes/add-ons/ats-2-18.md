## 2.18

**Release date: May 12th 2020**

### Improvements

* ATS now supports recording and execution of clicking on containers and list views. 

### Fixes

* We fixed a bug where ATS would not record clicking a dropdown div converter.
* We fixed a bug where ATS would not correctly click on a radio button.
* Due to a bug cutting elements whose total length would exceed 200 characters resulted in an error. This is no longer allowed and is preceded by a warning message.
* We fixed a bug where clicking on an association radio button list was not properly recorder or executed.
* We fixed a bug introduced in 2.17.1 where unique names would no longer include list item names.
