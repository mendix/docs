## Introduction

The [Amazon Textract](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/205646) connector provides a way for you to enrich your Mendix app with the capability to extract text, handwriting and data from documents by implementing [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/).

### Typical Use Cases

Amazon Textract helps improve your app by giving you the tools to extract data from documents in a structured manner. For example, you can use it to extract business data from handwritten documents, or patient data from intake forms.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The Amazon Textract connector requires Mendix Studio Pro 9.18.0 or above.

To authenticate with Amazon Web Service (AWS), you must also install and configure the [AWS authentication connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333). From Amazon Textract Connector version 2.0.0 on, AWS Authentication 3.0.0 or newer is required. For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/modules/aws/aws-authentication/).

### Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## Installation

Follow the instructions in [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/use-content/) to import the Amazon Textract connector into your app.

## Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonTextractConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model and several activities](#technical-reference) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon Textract. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### Configuring AWS Authentication

In order to use the Amazon Textract service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

As of version 3.0.0 of the [AWS Authentication Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333), all the resources and logic required to set up authentication are centralized inside the AWS Authentication Connector module. 

The AWS Authentication Connector supports both **static credentials** and **temporary credentials**. For more information and detailed instructions please refer to the [AWS Authentication Connector documentation page](/appstore/modules/aws/aws-authentication/).
    
### Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After setting up the authentication, to analyze a document, implement the **AnalyzeDocument** activity by doing the following steps:

1. In the **Domain Model**, right-click on the work area, and then click **Add entity**.
2. Enter a name for your entity, for example, *Document*, and then click **OK**.
3. Double-click the **Document** entity, select the generalization **FileDocument**, and then click **OK**.
4. In the **Document** entity, find the **Access rules** tab.
5. Create new access rules by doing the following steps:
    1. Click **New**.
    2. Select a user role, and then select the checkboxes **Allow creating new objects** and **Allow deleting existing objects**. 
    3. Set the access rights for **Name**, **DeleteAfterDownload** and **Contents** to **Read/write**
    4. Set the remaining access rights to **Read**.

6. In the App Explorer, right-click on the name of your module, click **Add page**, and then select the **Grid** template.
7. Enter a name for your page, for example, *Document_Overview*, and then click **OK**.
8. In the **Properties** pane of **Document_Overview**, in the **Navigation** section, select **Visible for** for a user role (see the [Properties](/refguide/page-properties/#properties) section of *Page Properties*).
9. Configure your page by doing the following steps:
    1. Open the page. 
    2. Double-click on the data grid.
    3. In the **Data source** tab, select the **Document** entity.
    4. Click **OK**.
    5. Confirm that you want to automatically fill the contents of the data grid.
10. Create a page where your users can enter data for the app by doing the following steps:
    1. Right-click the **New** button in the data grid.
    2. Click **Generate page**.
    3. Enter a name for your page, for example, *Document_NewEdit*.
    4. Click **OK**.
11. In the **Properties** pane of **Document_NewEdit**, in the **Navigation** section, select **Visible for** for a user role (see the [Properties](/refguide/page-properties/#properties) section of *Page Properties*).
12. In the App Explorer, right-click on the name of your module, and then click **Add microflow**.
13. Enter a name for your microflow, for example, *ACT_AnalyzeDocument*, and then click **OK**.
14. Add an input [parameter](/refguide/parameter/) of the Document entity to the ACT_AnalyzeDocument microflow.
15. In the properties pane of *ACT_AnalyzeDocument*, under **Security**, assign a user role to **Allow** roles.
16. In the **App Explorer**, in the **AWSAuthentication** section, find the **GetStaticCredentials** and **GetTemporaryCredentials** microflows.
17. Drag the one you would like to use to your microflow.
18. In the **Toolbox** pane, search for the **Create object** activity and drag it onto the microflow area.
19. Configure the  **Create object** activity by doing the following steps:
