{{% /alert %}}

## 3 Access Management {#managing-app-users}

On the **Access Management** tab, you can manage and invite app users. App users are end-users who can access the deployed app on specific environments. They can use and test your deployed app, and provide feedback.

To manage users or invite users for an app deployed on a specific environment, click **Mange Users** or **Invite Users** for that environment. For more information, see the [Managing Users](#manage-users) and [Inviting Users](#invite-users) section below.

On the tab, you can only see the environments that satisfy these requirements:

* [Mendix Single Sign-On](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-sso/) is implemented in the app using the [Mendix SSO](/appstore/modules/mendix-sso/) module (for more information, see [Mendix Single Sign-On](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-sso/))
* Your user role allows you to manage other users (for more information, see the [User Management Properties](/refguide/user-roles/#user-management) section of *User Roles*)

### 3.1 Managing Users {#manage-users}

When you click **Manage Users** for your environment, a dialog box opens with a list of the current app users you can remove or edit:

To remove an app user from the environment, click **Remove** by their name.

To edit an app user's roles, click **Edit** by their name. Permissions for these roles (for example, **User** or **Administrator**) correspond to what you have configured for your app's user roles in [App Security](/refguide/app-security/#user-roles) in Mendix Studio Pro. If you have created a customized role, you need to publish the app before you are able to see and assign it here.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If an app user has been granted access to an app environment through a [group](/developerportal/control-center/#groups), only a Mendix Admin can remove them from that environment (by removing them from that group) or edit the roles granted by that group policy.
{{% /alert %}}

### 3.2 Inviting Users {#invite-users}

To invite new app users to your app, click **Invite Users** for that environment or via the **Manage Users** and follow these steps:

1. Enter the email addresses of the end-users you want to invite.
2. Click **Include your app team** to include invitations to all the members of your [Team](/developerportal/general/team/). This may be useful, because people invited to join your team are not added as app users automatically.
3. Click **Add to invitee list**.
4. Select the role for the App User (for example, **User** or **Administrator**). Permissions for these roles correspond to what you have configured for your app's user roles in [App Security](/refguide/app-security/#user-roles) in Mendix Studio Pro. If you have created a customized role, you need to publish the app before you are able to see and assign it here.
5. Click **Next** to send the invitation.

The invitee will receive an email asking them to authorize access to their Mendix account on this screen.

After they provide authorization, they will be brought to your deployed app.

## 4 Cloud Settings {#cloud-settings}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only users with the **App Settings** permission can change cloud platforms.
{{% /alert %}}

On the **Cloud Settings** tab, you can select the cloud platform on which to deploy your app. The selection of cloud platforms available will depend on the features of your Mendix account.

If you select a non-Mendix cloud platform like SAP, you will be redirected to a page to complete the setup. If you select Mendix Cloud, no additional setup is needed.

Specific steps for configuring different cloud platforms are provided here:

* [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/)
* [SAP Business Technology Platform](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/)
* [Mendix Private Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/)

## 5 API Keys {#general-settings-api-keys}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only users with the **App Settings** permission can manage app-specific API keys.
{{% /alert %}}

In **API Keys**, there is an overview of the API keys created for your app with the following information:

* **API Key Name**
* Date of **Creation**
* Date **Last Used**

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/settings/keys.png"   width="800"  >}}

To create a new app-specific API key, click **Create New API Key**  and follow these steps:

1. Fill in the **API key name**.
2. Click **Generate API Key** to be able to use the app API key.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}For security reasons, the app API key will only be displayed once, during **Step 2 of 2**. It will not be displayed again.{{% /alert %}}

You use these API keys to authenticate requests to the [Stories API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/stories-api/).

To delete an app API key, click **Revoke**.

## 6 Project Management {#project-management}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only users with the **App Settings** permission can manage these settings.
{{% /alert %}}

On the **Project Management** tab, you can select your team's planning tool for the app. By default, [Epics](/developerportal/project-management/epics/) is the selected tool.

It is possible to migrate all or part of your content from [Stories](/developerportal/project-management/stories/) to Epics. For details, see the [Data Migration](/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/#data-migration) section of *Planning*.

If you manage your projects in Jira, you can connect your apps in the Developer Portal to Jira. For more information, see [Jira Connector](/developerportal/project-management/jira-connector/).

## 7 Webhooks {#webhooks}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
This tab is for webhooks for stories and Sprints, and it is deprecated. This tab will be removed and these webhooks will be discontinued later in 2023. It is no longer possible to add new webhook configurations for stories and Sprints to your apps, but existing configurations will remain active and can still be edited. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You can also set webhooks for your app to trigger endpoints when changes are made to deployment packages or models held in the git Team Server. For details, see [Webhooks](/developerportal/deploy/webhooks/).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This tab is only visible if you already have webhooks for stories and Sprints created, you are a **Scrum Master**, and you have **Mendix Stories** turned on in the [Project Management](#project-management) tab.
{{% /alert %}}

Open the **Webhooks** tab to manage your app's webhooks for stories and Sprints. A webhook enables the Developer Portal to talk to another website and post updated Developer Portal content (for example, Sprint updates and new stories) to that website. For example, if you want to follow the changes in your app, you can create a service with a certain [URL](#url) that keeps track of the data, and then changes in the app in the Developer Portal are sent to that URL.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/settings/webhooks-list.png" width="800"  >}}

After clicking **New Webhook** to create a new webhook for stories and sprints, fill in the following details:

* **Name** – the name of the webhook for stories and Sprints
* <a id="url"></a>**URL** – the URL to which the webhook for stories and Sprints will connect 
* **Secret** – the secret used by the Developer Portal to sign the data payload in order to identify the source of the data to the receiving URL (this appears when creating and editing a webhook for stories and Sprints, but it will not be displayed on the **Webhooks settings** page)
* **Version** – the version of the webhooks feature to be used
* **Events** – what types of data will be sent via the webhook for stories and Sprints (you must select at least one; this appears when creating and editing a webhook for stories and Sprints, but it will not be displayed on the **Webhooks settings** page)
    * [Sprints](/developerportal/project-management/stories/#story-actions)
    * [Stories](/developerportal/project-management/stories/)

To edit the above details for an existing webhook for stories and Sprints, click **Edit**.

To delete an existing webhook for stories and Sprints, click **Delete**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
For details on the technical configuration of webhooks for stories and sprints, see [Webhooks for Stories and Sprints](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/webhooks-sprints/) in the *API Documentation*.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/settings/history.png"   width="700"  >}}

When you select a history item and click **Show item**, the details of the story, Sprint, or [feedback item](/developerportal/general/feedback/) will be presented.

## 9 Story Archive {#story-archive}

Once you have switched from Mendix Stories to Epics or Jira, we archive any work you may have had in Mendix Stories. You can review your work on this tab, and download it if necessary.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
We will delete all data from Mendix Stories starting October 1, 2023. We strongly urge you to download your work before that date.
