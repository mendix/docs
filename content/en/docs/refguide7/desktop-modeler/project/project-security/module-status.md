The module status overview shows the security status for each module. It shows the total number of items for which security needs to be configured, as well as the number of items for which security has been configured already. At the 'Prototype / demo' security level, the status of form access and microflow access is shown. Additionally, at the 'Production' security level, the status of entity access and dataset access (if applicable) is shown.
