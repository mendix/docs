## Introduction

The [AWS IoT TwinMaker](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/209624) connector allows you to connect your Mendix app to [AWS IoT TwinMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-twinmaker/) and read data from the digital twin of your system.

### Typical Use Cases

AWS IoT TwinMaker makes it easier for developers to create digital twins of real-world systems such as buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines. AWS IoT TwinMaker provides the tools you need to build digital twins to help you optimize building operations, increase production output, and improve equipment performance. With the ability to use existing data from multiple sources, create virtual representations of any physical environment, and combine existing 3D models with real-world data, you can now harness digital twins to create a holistic view of your operations faster and with less effort. When used with your Mendix app, the AWS IoT TwinMaker connector enables you to build actionable dashboards on top of AWS IoT Twinmaker, and build applications on top of the service with little coding experience required.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The AWS IoT TwinMaker connector requires Mendix Studio Pro version 9.18.3 or above.

To authenticate with Amazon Web Service (AWS), you must also install and configure the [AWS authentication connector version 2.1 or higher](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333). If you are using the AWS IoT TwinMaker connector version 3.0.0 or higher, it requires the AWS Authentication connector version 3.0.0 or higher. For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/modules/aws/aws-authentication/).

### Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## Installation

Follow the instructions in [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/use-content/) to import the AWS IoT TwinMaker connector into your app.

## Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AWSTwinMakerConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model and several activities](#technical-reference) that you can use to connect your app to AWS IoT TwinMaker. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### Configuring AWS Authentication

In order to use the AWS IoT TwinMaker service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

As of version 3.0.0 of the [AWS Authentication Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333), all the resources and logic required to set up authentication are centralized inside the AWS Authentication Connector module. 

The AWS Authentication Connector supports both **static credentials** and **temporary credentials**. For more information and detailed instructions please refer to the [AWS Authentication Connector documentation page](/appstore/modules/aws/aws-authentication/).

### Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After you configure the authentication profile for AWS IoT TwinMaker, you can implement the functions of the connector by using the provided activities in microflows. For example, to list all workspaces, implement the **ListWorkspace** activity by doing the following steps:

1. In the **App Explorer**, find and open the domain model for your app.
2. Right-click on the working area of the domain model, and then click **Add entity**.
