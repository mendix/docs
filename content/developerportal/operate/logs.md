## 1 Introduction

From this page of the Developer Portal, you can access the logs produced by your app. What you see depends on the environment to which your app is deployed.

The page is accessed through the **Logs** menu item under the **Operate** category:

For apps deployed to Mendix Cloud Version 4 (v4), you can select which environment you want logs for. Production logs will require [Two-Factor Authentication](/developerportal/deploy/two-factor-authentication).

You can view the live (current) log, download it, or view and download an archived log.

The live log is displayed in the local time of the browser. All other logs have timestamps in UTC.

Logs on Mendix Cloud v4 are rotated and archived every day. The logs are kept for at least 3 months.

## 4 Apps on SAP Cloud Platform

For apps deployed to SAP Cloud Platform you can see the logs using Kibana.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
To make full use of Kibana and see proper mapping of the log level, multiline log messages, and stack traces, you will need to configure the *SAP Logger Connector* in your app. For more information see [SAP Logger Connector](/partners/sap/sap-logger).
{{% /alert %}}

The logs page shows all the environments for this app. Click the **Logs** button to open the log in Kibana.

You may be asked to provide your SAP credentials before you can see the log in Kibana.

The Kibana user guide is available here: [Kibana User Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html) and within Kibana. More information on how Kibana is integrated with SAP Cloud Platform is available on the SAP help site here: [Application Logging for the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ee8e8a203e024bbb8c8c2d03fce527dc/Cloud/en-US/68454d44ad41458788959485a24305e2.html).

{{% alert type="info" %}}For apps deployed to environments created before 22 October 2018, the *Application Logging (application-logs)* service will not have been bound to your app automatically. To resolve this you can either:

1. Create a new environment and deploy your app there.

2. Bind the service to your existing app by:

    * Going to the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit
    * Going to the space for your environment
    * Finding *Application Logging* in the Service Marketplace
    * Going to *Instances*
    * Creating a *New Instance* and following the instructions, ensuring that you bind it to your app
    * Stopping and starting the app
