## Introduction

Mendix hosts a variety of services in the cloud. These include the environments for apps that are deployed to Mendix Cloud, as well as various online services (such as app Buzz).

The status of each of these services is reported on the [Mendix Platform Status](https://status.mendix.com/) page.

## Mendix Cloud Statuses
