## 2 Where Should We Upload Your App?

Use this setting to select the location where you want to store your app. This can be the Team Server, a private server (an SVN server other than the Team Server), or a local disk.

### 2.1 New Mendix Team Server

In the **App name** field, enter the name for the new Team Server project and repository. After you click **OK**, the new repository will be created in the [Mendix Team Server](/refguide7/team-server/) to store your app. 

### 2.2 Existing Mendix Team Server

In the **Team Server App** list, select the corresponding Team Server app. After you click **OK**, you app will be uploaded to the selected repository.

This only works when the existing repository is empty.

### 2.3 Private Server

In the **App repository address** field, enter the repository address you want to upload your app to. After you click **OK**, you app will be uploaded to this repository.

This option is only available when support for other servers is enabled in the [Preferences](/refguide7/preferences-dialog/#enabled) dialog box.
