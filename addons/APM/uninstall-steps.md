This chapter describes the uninstallation of the APM tool. The optional in this chapter means you need to verify if this option was chosen during the install before undoing it.

# Optional: Revert After startup and before shutdown

Remove the call microflow action to APMAgent\USE_ME\AfterStartup from an after startup microflow. This feature is runtime configurable and by default none of the tools are started.
Remove the call microflow action to APMAgent\USE_ME\BeforeShutdown from a before shutdown microflow.
You can find the AfterStartup and BeforeShutdown microflows in the project settings.
