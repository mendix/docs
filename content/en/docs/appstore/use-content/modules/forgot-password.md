## Introduction

The [Forgot Password](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1296/) module enables the users to sign up and also to reset their password. It works with the local accounts which are managed within your Mendix App. These accounts are the best choice when you do not want to use a single sign-on (SSO) solution to integrate with your existing identity and access management (IAM) infrastructure.

This module allows the end-user to enter their email address, and an email will be sent with a confirmation link. The end-user then opens the link and gets the option to reset their password in both scenarios (sign up and forgot password). In the sign up case, the end-user is also asked to provide their name. For version 5.3.0 and above of the module, you can specify different templates to be sent, depending on the language in which the end-user is seeing the app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Versions of the Forgot Password module below 4.1.0 (for Mendix 8) and 5.1.0 (for Mendix 9 and above) have a dependency on the deprecated [Email Module with Templates](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/259/) module. Mendix recommends upgrading to the later version using the instructions in [Migrate from Email Module with Templates to Email Connector](#migrate-email) section below.

1. Open the [App Settings](/refguide/app-settings/) and make the following changes:
    * In the [Configurations](/refguide/configuration/) tab, edit the current configuration to add a 32-character string value for the constant **Encryption.EncryptionKey**.
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/forgot-password/encryption-key.png" class="no-border" >}}
    * In the **Runtime** tab, add the microflow **Deeplink.StartDeeplink** as the **After startup** microflow or as a sub-microflow to an existing after startup microflow.
    {{% alert color="warning" %}}For the Forgot Password module version 6.0.0 (Mendix 10.6.0 and above), do not add the **Deeplink.StartDeeplink** microflow as the **After startup** microflow.{{% /alert %}}
    * If you are changing the **URL prefix** value in the **Runtime** tab, ensure that you use the same value in the URLPrefix constant of the Forgot Password module. Otherwise, the signup and reset URLs will not work.
1. Open [App Security](/refguide/app-security/) and do the following:
    * In the **User roles** tab, add a new role called *Guest* in **MyFirstModule**
    {{% alert color="warning" %}}Do not set any Deep Link userroles in the **App security** for the version 6.0.0 (Mendix 10.6.0 and above).{{% /alert %}}
    * Set the following permissions for the user roles:

        * Administrator
            * **Administration.Administrator**
            * **DeepLink.Admin**
            * **Email_Connector.EmailConnectorAdmin** or **EmailTemplate.Administrator** - **Email_Connector** permissions are needed if you are using version 4.1.0 or above (for Mendix 8) or version 5.1.0 or above (for Mendix 9 and above). **EmailTemplate** permissions are only needed if using a version which uses the deprecated [Email Module with Templates](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/259/) module
            * **Encryption.user**
            * **ForgotPassword.Administrator**
            * **MxModelReflection.ModeAdministrator**
            * **System.Administrator**
            * **MyFirstModule.Administrator**
        * Guest
            * **DeepLink.User**
            * **ForgotPassword.Guest_ResetPassword**
            * **ForgotPassword.Guest_SignUp**
            * **System.User**
            * **MyFirstModule.Guest**
        * User
            * **Administration.User**
            * **DeepLink.User**
            * **ForgotPassword.Guest_ResetPassword**
            * **MxModelReflection.Readonly**
            * **MxModelReflection.TokenUser**

1. Open [Navigation](/refguide/navigation/) and do the following:
    * Set **Role-based home pages** so the target of user role **Guest** is **ForgotPassword.Nav_GuestHomePage**
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/forgot-password/role-based-home.png" class="no-border" >}}
        The **Nav_GuestHomePage** microflow is the home page for an anonymous user. This microflow either shows the login page or triggers the deep link process which performs the reset password function.
    * Add the menu item **ForgotPasswordConfiguration** to the app navigation. Link this item to the **ForgotPassword.ForgotPasswordConfiguration_Edit** page and assign it to the **Administrator** user role.
        {{% alert color="warning" %}}The **ForgotPasswordConfiguration** page should be accessible to the administrator only. It allows the administrator to configure the email template and deep link, and it shows all the open password reset requests.{{% /alert %}}
1. If you are using version 5.3.0 or above of the Forgot Password module, open [Module Security](/refguide/module-security/#entity-access) for the **Email_Connector** module in the Marketplace. On the **Entity Access** tab, assign read-only access to the **Email_Connector.EmailConnectorAdmin** module role on the **EmailTemplateLanguage_EmailTemplate** template.
1. Run the application.
1. Sign in as **demo_administrator** from [Demo Users](/refguide/demo-users/) and choose the **ForgotPasswordConfiguration** menu item.
1. In the **Reset Password Email** tab, do the following:
    * Click **SMTP settings** to configure or validate SMTP settings for the [Email Connector](/appstore/connectors/email-connector/) or [Email Module with Templates](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/259/) module (depending on the version of the Forgot Password module). In version 5.4.0 and above this will create a SMTP configuration which you will need to select.
    * In version 5.4.0 and above, select the SMTP configuration you want to use for sending reset password email.
    * From the drop-down menu, choose the **Reset email template** tab and provide the details for the email to be sent when an end-user has forgotten their password.

        For version 5.3.0 and above, you can **Create** and **Edit** several reset email templates. Each template is linked to a [language](/refguide/language-settings/) you have added to your app. Based on the language in which end-user sees the app, the associated template will be used to send the reset email. If no template is explicitly associated with the end-user's language, the template which is not associated with any language will be used. For versions below 5.3.0, you can only set up a single template.

        For version 5.4.0 and above, the **fromAddress** in the email template does not have to be the same as the address in your SMTP configuration. For more information, see [Using Email Aliases](#email-aliases) section below.

1. In the **Signup Email** tab, provide the details for the email to be sent when an end-user wants to sign up. These options are same as described above, for the **Reset Password Email** tab.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}
To disable the sign up functionality and use the Forgot Password module only for resetting passwords, do the following:

* Remove the **Sign-up** button from the **LoginSnippet** snippet in the **_Use Me** folder of the Forgot Password Marketplace module.
* Remove all the actions from the **CreateNewUserFromSignUp** microflow.
    {{% /alert %}}

1. In the **Deeplink** tab, configure the deeplink to use the **ForgotPassword.Step3_DL_SetNewPassword** microflow.
        {{% alert color="info" %}}The **Deeplink** tab is not available in version 6.0.0 (for Mendix 10.6.0 and above) as the Deep Link module has been deprecated.{{% /alert %}}
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/modules/forgot-password/configure-deeplink.png" class="no-border" >}}

### Using Email Aliases{#email-aliases}

From version 5.4.0 of the Forgot Password module, the **fromAddress** used in the email template does not have to be the same as the email address in the SMTP configuration. This provides flexibility, allowing you to send emails from different addresses while utilizing the same SMTP configuration for authentication.

Consider a scenario, where your SMTP username is *user@example.com* and you have configured this account in your SMTP configuration. You could set the **fromAddress** in your email template to be any email address or alias you have control over, such as **sales@example.com**, **support@example.com**, or **ceo@example.com**, and this is what the recipient will see in the email they receive.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You may have to configure an email alias on your SMTP server if you are using a different **fromAddress** in your email template than the email address of your selected SMTP account. Some SMTP servers will not send emails if the **fromAddress** is not associated with the SMTP account.
{{% /alert %}}

## Testing the Forgot Password Module

### Migration FAQs

#### What Happens If the Email Templates Don't Have the Right Names?

Associations between Email-connector.EmailTemplate and ForgotPassword.Configuration will not be migrated and you will not be able to see your existing templates. You will have to create the templates again.

#### What Happens If the Database Contains More than One Template with the Same Template Name?

Only the first one found during the migration will be associated with the Email Connector configuration.

#### What Happens If I Click **Start Migration** on the **ETToEC Overview** Page Multiple Times?

Your data will be migrated multiple times and duplicate records will be created in the database.

#### What Should I Do If My Email Templates Are Not Available after Migration?

You will have to create templates again using the Forgot Password configuration page, as described in [Installing the Forgot Password Module](#installing) section above.
