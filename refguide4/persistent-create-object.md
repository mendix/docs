The persistent-create-object action is the result of converting a create-object action from version 3\. This action not only creates the object in memory but also inserts a row in the database. This action is deprecated and there will be a warning for it in the error list. Right-clicking the warning allows you to find all occurrences and to convert them to new [create actions](create-object).

In obscure cases you can detect the difference between the old and the new create action. For example, if you look at the database after the create action but before a corresponding commit action, the object will not be in the database if you used the new create action. Because we cannot guarantee 100% backward compatibility we do not convert the persistent create actions automatically.
