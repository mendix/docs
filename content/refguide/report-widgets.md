## 1 Introduction

With reporting, you can create reports over the database data. Reporting is used for creating aggregated information (for example , total sales per customer). 

The **Report widgets** category contains the following widgets:

* [**Report grid**](report-grid)  – displays data in a form of a table; data for the reporting widgets is provided by [Datasets](data-sets) 
* [**Report parameter**](report-parameter) – allows a user to specify a parameter of a [dataset](data-sets) that is then used for filtering the data displayed in a report. However, you must also add a [Generate report button](report-button) widget so that it is possible to regenerate the report after specifying the parameter.
* [**Report date parameter**](report-date-parameter) – allows a user to specify the DateTime parameter of a [dataset](data-sets), which is then used for filtering the data displayed in a report
* [**Generate report button**](report-button) – generates a report when an end-user click the button
