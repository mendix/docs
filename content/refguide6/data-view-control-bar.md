{{% alert type="info" %}}

The data view control bar has been converted to a normal drop zone, and renamed to 'footer' in version 6.7.0\. See [Data view footer](data-view).

{{% /alert %}}

The control bar of the data view can have the following kinds of buttons: save, cancel, close, and microflow buttons. A typical data view has a 'save' and a 'cancel' button; if it is not editable, a close button is sufficient.

Microflow buttons can be used to add buttons with custom behavior to the control bar. For example, you can create a button that only validates the information in the data view but does not commit the information.
