The following XPath query aggregate functions are available:

* [avg](/refguide7/xpath-avg/)
* [count](/refguide7/xpath-count/)
* [id](/refguide7/xpath-id/)
* [max](/refguide7/xpath-max/)
* [min](/refguide7/xpath-min/)
* [sum](/refguide7/xpath-sum/)

These functions must contain full queries as their arguments. However, the `avg`, `max`, `min`, and `sum` functions must specify a column in the query to aggregate.
