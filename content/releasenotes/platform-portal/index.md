## 2018

### January 25th, 2018

#### Fixes

* Happy new year! We addressed the issue where backup downloads were logged as restored backups in the activity log.
* If you had a **Backups** section of your apps open in multiple tabs, you saw multiple activity log entries for each action taken. That's fixed now.
* The restart and stop/start activities are now distinctly defined in the **Activity** section.
* Branches of an application are sorted alphabetically, but **Main Line** is now always on top.
* The target cloud of a Free App is now shown correctly in the **Environments** section.
* The broken styling of the **View Current Log** button for a Free App has been fixed.

#### Improvements

* The **Alerts** section in Mendix Cloud V4 apps will now include health check details, just like for Mendix Cloud V3 apps.
* It is now possible for you to change the technical contact of your applications by yourself.

## 2017

### December 29th, 2017

#### Fixes

* In Mendix Cloud v4, the **archived log** function returned logs from a broader time range than what the user had selected (for example, the logs for one day returned log data from two days). This was fixed.

### December 22nd, 2017

#### Improvements

* We are introducing a **Restart** button for Mendix Cloud environments. This is useful for preparing configuration changes and activating them with only one click.

#### Fixes

* It's now possible to scale Mendix 6 applications on Cloud V4. Previously, this was only possible with environments that run Mendix 7 apps. With Mendix 6 apps, you can only scale the allocated memory, but not the amount of instances.
* Big backups are now welcomed on V4 environments, as we fixed the issue that prevented users from uploading backup packages larger than 5 GBs.
* We fixed the issue where some Mendix Cloud V3 users were not able to set a specified Java version for environments.
* Hovering over a Mendix Cloud environment status icon will now give more information about the environment's health.

### December 13th, 2017

#### Fixes

* The JVM Process Memory graph in Cloud v4 now also show the native memory of the application.
* The Application Node Operating System Memory graph for Cloud v4 now shows as two lines: total and used. The previous version displayed the total added to the used in a stacked area graph, which was very confusing.

### December 6th, 2017

#### Fixes

* We adressed the issue that prevents Free Apps from being embedded in an iframe.

### November 27th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Free App users now have the option to select between Web Modeler and Desktop Modeler for editing their application models.

### November 15th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Mendix Cloud v4 backups can now be restored to other environments in the same Mendix Cloud node. This is useful when preparing production migrations or for reproducing errors.
* When creating a deployment package from Team Server, the dialog box now shows branches in case-insensitive order, which makes more sense for users.
* Mendix Cloud v4 alert status showed `UNKNOWN` sometimes due to an error. This was fixed and the correct status is now shown.
* In the **Deploy**, **Operate**, and **Backups** pages, you can *finally* use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to submit your two-factor authentication code. Happy typing!

### October 20th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Deploying a different version without stopping a running application is also now available on Mendix Cloud v3. Once the deployment is done, you can restart the application with a single click.
* We improved the error handling. Much more user-friendly feedback messages are provided in case of an error.
* The user experience of backup uploads has been improved for Mendix Cloud v4. It is also possible to manually delete the old backups on Mendix Cloud v4.
* We made a series of minor user experience improvements for metrics on Mendix Cloud v4.

#### Fixes

* When creating a deployment package from Team Server, users will now be able to see the revisions that were committed without the Mendix Modeler.

### October 10th, 2017

#### Improvements

* We removed the backup expiry entries from the activity logs for all applications in the Mendix Cloud, as we found they cluttered the overview and did not provide any useful information to users.

### September 29th, 2017

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where a user who signed up to Mendix would get an error page in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

### September 28th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Deployments with almost no downtime: It is now possible to deploy a different version without stopping a running application. Once the deployment is done, you can restart the application with a single click. This is now available for Mendix Cloud v4. For Mendix Cloud v3, this will be available soon.
* Improved the robustness of the Deploy API: Occasional failures that occured while starting/stopping an environment via the Deploy API no longer occur.
* Improved the stability for transporting deployment packages for Asia-Pacific users for Mendix Cloud v4.
* Environment health indicators for your environments are now much more accurate.

#### Fixes

* We fixed a problem where Team Server branches that were committed without the Mendix Modeler were hidden in the Cloud Portal.
* We fixed a problem where changing an access restriction profile could display a wrong error about having more than 1 certificate in use.

### September 25th, 2017

#### Improvements

* We changed the link at the bottom of our notification mails to point to a page where you can unsubscribe from these emails.

#### Fixes

* We fixed the link to the *Deploy on-premises* docs in the Cloud Settings page.

### September 20th, 2017

#### Improvements

* It is now possible to accept invitations and confirm signups on mobile devices.
* The Security page for an application (Settings > Security) will now also show the company of an app team member, making it easier to identify external user accounts. (Ticket 51296)

#### Fixes

* Deleting a document will no longer delete the corresponding discussion thread. Instead, a note that the previously uploaded document was deleted will be added to the discussion thread. Conversely, it is no longer possible to delete a discussion thread that has comments with uploaded documents. (Ticket 46480)
* Updated the Excel import functionality with various fixes and security improvements.


### August 30th, 2017

#### Improvements

* The user interface of the instance/memory slider for Cloud v4 has been improved considerably. Scaling will also appear in the activity log of the application.
* For Mendix Cloud v4, we do no longer show the size of the archived log. The size we displayed previously was wrong.
* The expiry date for Mendix Cloud backups is now visible in the backup list.

### August 22nd, 2017

#### Improvements

* Due to various optimizations, the deployment speed for apps in Mendix Cloud v4 EU is now about twice as fast. The latency for FileDocument read/write actions has also improved for all Mendix Cloud v4 regions.

### August 15th, 2017

#### Improvements

* We enabled path-based access restrictions for all Mendix Cloud v3 apps. This allows users to more easily configure access restrictions on their environments. For more information, see [Access Restrictions](/deployment/mendixcloud/access-restrictions). Mendix Cloud v4 already has this functionality enabled.

### August 14th, 2017

#### Fixes

* We fixed the issue where users with Microsoft browsers would get an error page after signup instead of automatically continuing to the Developer Portal.

### August 11th, 2017

#### Fixes

* We fixed the issue where Desktop Modeler users couldn't submit feedback items.
* We fixed the issue where team member names in the **Node Security** screen were empty and only visible after a refresh.

### August 2nd, 2017

* Company Admins can invite users to all the apps within their company. (Ticket 51296)
* Company Admins can export a list of all company members from the **Members** page. (Ticket 52683)
* Technical Contacts can access the **Node Permissions** page, even when they don't have app admin rights. (Tickets 51315, 53088, 54081)
* The Stories API and Feedback API return sprints, stories, and feedback items in the same order as shown in the Platform Portal.

### August 1st, 2017

#### Improvements

* For Mendix Cloud v3, Java will be upgraded, including the most recent security updates. The Java KeyStore has also been updated. It contains trusted root certificates for secure outgoing connections from your Mendix app. For example, with the updated Java KeyStore, you are now able to connect to endpoints that use a certificate signed by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Root certificates that are considered unsecure by Oracle and Mozilla have been removed. Your app will automatically start using a newer Java version and KeyStore when you restart the app. For Mendix Cloud v4, we are still planning the rollout of this fix.

### July 31st, 2017

#### Fixes

* The [Deploy API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api) for apps in Mendix Cloud v4 contained multiple bugs in the start, stop and transport calls. These are now fixed.

### July 18th, 2017

#### Improvements

* For all apps running on the Mendix Cloud, the following HTTP request headers are now available: `SSL-Protocol` (possible values: `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`) and `SSL-Cipher` (for example, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`). These can be used to block login attempts (for example, `TLSv1` connections). *(Please note that these release notes previously stated the header name was `SSL-Version`, but it should have been `SSL-Protocol`.)*
* Modern browsers are aggressively caching static HTML resources, which can lead to user problems after deploying new versions of applications. Clearing the cache can solve this, but that is a bad user experience. So, for all apps running on Mendix Cloud v3, we have added an explicit `no-cache` header to the resources `/` and `/index.html`, `/login.html`, and `/index[0-9].html`. For Mendix Cloud v4, an `expires` with a negative value was already used, so no changes are required there. We believe this change eliminates most of the browser caching issues we have seen so far.
* You can now restrict access to your Mendix Cloud v4 applications based on IP ranges. This is available for all Mendix Cloud v4 regions and can be configured from the **Network** tab of your cloud environment.

#### Fixes

* When updating the admin user password in the Mendix Cloud, the password policy description was wrong, which led to confusing situations. We updated the text.
* When navigating to **Node Security**, the **App Team** tab no longer disappears.
* Due to a ZIP file encoding change in Mendix 7.5.0, AppServices could not be parsed when deploying to the Mendix Cloud. We fixed this.
* The **View Current Log** button is no longer hidden for Free Apps.

### July 12th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Every platform user is now enabled to create Web Modeler apps!

#### Fixes

* A story in a completed sprint no longer disappears when you open the details view.
* The Mendix Feedback Widget now supports reporting feedback from pages with very long URLs.

### June 21st, 2017

* Private company App Store content is now indicated in the **Template** browser with a lock icon.

### June 7th, 2017

#### Fixes

* We fixed the issue with the input of Japanese characters in the feedback widget.

### May 19th, 2017

#### Fixes

* We corrected the backup retention scheme for paid applications on Mendix Cloud v4, and it is now the same as on Mendix Cloud v3.
* The "view current log" functionality for Mendix Cloud v4 applications was empty by default and the **Show all** button needed to be used. It now shows the content right away.

### May 17th, 2017

#### Improvements

* We upgraded the SSL/TLS ciphers for connections to apps in Mendix Cloud v4. These included dropping block-based ciphers (3DES), moving to 2048 bit DH params. Mendix Cloud v4 now has an [A+ rating at SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html).
* We added HTTP/2 support for connections to all apps in Mendix Cloud v3 and Mendix Cloud v4. HTTP/2 is supported by all major browsers and results in more efficient network connections. [Read more about HTTP/2 here](https://http2.github.io/faq/).

### May 4th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Transporting a new deployment package dead-ended in a "Deploy successful" screen. Users are redirected to the environment details screen, which is much more useful.

#### Fixes

* We fixed the failing of large backups in Mendix Cloud v4. Backups will now only fail when the disk of the database is filled up.
* Alert Details now highlights the right menu item.
* Fixed a race condition where two apps created at the same time could get the same domain name.
* Added a warning message before restore backup, to prevent users clearing their environment. Clearing the environment before restoring resulted in a much slower non-incremental restore operation.
* Disabled automatic copying of "Data Snapshots" to empty environments in Mendix Cloud v4 Pro/Enterprise environments. This features is only used in Free Apps. Weak admin passwords in the database snapshot would prevent the app from starting.

### April 5th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Posting comments to a discussion on the Buzz sometimes took a long time to complete. We made a change so that comments now appear almost instantly after hitting the **Post Comment** button. This change will also speed up completing sprints with stories which have associated feedback items.

#### Fixes

* We fixed the issue where invitation dialogs would be shown twice in some situations. They are now shown just once.

### April 1st, 2017

* We added list backups/download backup operations to the [Deploy API](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api#DeployAPI-ListBackups).
* We fixed the status page link in alert emails.
* We updated the **Security** link from the Deploy/Operate tabs. It now goes to the same page on all pages in the platform.
* We fixed the issue where the Free Apps backups page was very slow or resulted in an error in some cases.
* We fixed the issue where the log viewer for Free Apps did not escape HTML, so if the application logged plain HTML, it was interpreted in the browser.
* We fixed the issue where simultaneous snapshot restore jobs from the same environment to two others could lock one of the environments.
* We updated links from *world.mendix.com* to *docs.mendix.com*.

### March 20th, 2017

* The Deploy / Operate sections in the Platform Portal were broken on Internet Explorer 11 due to widget incompatibility, introduced in the previous release. This was already hot-patched in production on March 16th.

### March 13th, 2017

* The highlighted menu state was fixed, the wrong items were highlighted in some instances
* AppStore links clicked from within the Deploy/Operate sections now open in the same tab
* The **Show Profile** link was broken in some parts of the platform
* Clicking **Operate -> Backups** resulted in errors for a Free App
* Various fixes for internal beta program

### March 10th, 2017

* We introduced a new setting in **Node Security**, you can now configure **Monitoring Permissions** separately from **Transport Permissions**. Immediately after this change, we granted all users that had **Transport Permissions** on an environment the **Monitoring Permissions** there as well. From now on, a **Technical Contact** can configure these settings for everyone in the team separately. While we introduced this setting, we revisited the layout of the **Node Security** screen, you now have a simpler interface to change the permissions en each environment.

### March 9th, 2017

#### Improvements
* We improved the performance of sprint completion. This should now take significantly less time.
* The App Store now shares the same navigation top bar, and it will therefore now be opened in the same tab.
* We made various small styling improvements.

#### Fixes
* We fixed the issue in which completing a sprint from the **Stories** page wouldn't properly update the UI.
* The **getAccounts** call in the **UserManagementAPI** will now sort results consistently on **EmailAddress** when using limit/offset.

### February 21st, 2017

#### New Features
* We added the **View App** and **Edit App** buttons. The **View App** button brings you to the deployment URL of your Free App, or, if you have test, acceptance, and production environments, it lets you choose between these environments using a drop-down menu. The **Edit App** button will launch the Desktop Modeler if you have it installed; if you are part of the partner group testing the Web Modeler, then you'll have the choice to directly open your app in the WM.
* We redesigned the interface. The new look sports light colors and a responsive layout. Menu items pertaining to your apps have been moved from the top to the left-hand side. Users with permissions to access restricted parts of the Mendix App Platform can navigate there using the **Profile** menu, which opens when you click your avatar in the top-right corner of the screen.
* We improved the breadcrumbs. A header on top of the Mendix App Platform will show you where you are in the navigation structure.
* The **Feedback** widget can now be used when opened on small screen sizes (for example, on a  smartphone).
* The **Guidance** sidebar has been replaced by the **Intercom** widget.

#### Bug fixes
* We fixed the password reset form giving an error if you tried to submit it using the **Enter** key (even though you would receive a link).
* We fixed the **Team** overview flickering every few seconds that occurred after you create a new app.
* We fixed the screen jumping at every key-press that occurred while you were writing a large post on the Buzz.

### February 20th, 2017

* We removed static information from the log lines in Mendix Cloud v3. Every line before contained `tr10000` and `127.0.0.1`. We removed these fields as they were useless.

## 2016

### October 5th, 2016

* On Webkit-based browsers such as Safari a "connection error" dialog would sometimes pop up while loading the Dev Portal, after which the page would continue to load normally. We now prevent this dialog from appearing so that people can open the Dev Portal uninterrupted.

### May 12th, 2016

* The colors and styling of the Development Portal have been brought in line with the rest of the platform.

### March 4th, 2016

* Fixed the Invite API - it is again possible to invite other users to your app using a custom invitation flow.

### February 8th, 2016

* Advanced Runtime Settings can now be configured for the paid tiers in Mendix Cloud applications. You can find a list of all custom settings here: [Custom Settings](/refguide6/custom-settings)
* The advanced settings LogMinDurationQuery and ClientQueryTimeout have been enabled by default. LogMinDurationQuery will print all database queries that take longer than 10 seconds to the application log and ClientQueryTimeout will cancel database select queries triggered from the Client that take longer than 15 minutes, which is when the http timeout has kicked in so the results can not be delivered and the query can safely be killed. A restart of the application is required for these changes to take effect.

### January 13th, 2016

* The Technical Contact of an application can now assign other people as the Technical Contact using the Node Security tab in the Project Settings on [https://home.mendix.com/](https://home.mendix.com/).

## 2015

### December 1st, 2015

* The Mendix Cloud switched from the Jetty blocking I/O connector to a selector based non-blocking I/O connector for all applications. Due to a bug in the blocking I/O connector HTTP requests could be fired multiple times for long-running (> 2 minutes) requests, which would result in strange results in the Mendix Debugger (ticket 462699). If you want to apply this fix you can simply restart your application.
* Fixed bug that occurs when a which contains a large SVN directory is exposed into an Online Working Copy using Mendix Platform SDK.

### November 30th, 2015

* The story details page now provides more context, by showing comments, tasks and feedback when applicable.
* It is now easier to swap the priority of stories, using the arrow buttons at the left of each story and task.

### October 16th, 2015

#### Improvements

### September 3rd, 2015

#### New features
* All expanded items in the backlog can be collapsed at once, by using either the new 'Collapse All' button in the toolbar or the keyboard shortcut <ctrl+space>.
* New stories can be pre-filled with a default set of tasks, which can be defined as a Story Template on the Capture page (click More>Manage story templates).

#### Improvements
* The signup process takes less time to complete
* The 'details' link of each story in the backlog is now always visible, making it easier to access to the story details page.

#### Bug fix
* Removed the unnecessary confirmation popup at the end of the sign up process.

### August 6th, 2015

## 2014

### December 30th, 2014

* The loading time of the Deploy tab of a project has been decreased dramatically.
* The "Create package from teamserver" button is now always visible. Previously it was only visible for projects that are on Mendix 5, but as most users are on Mendix 5 we dropped this restriction. Users that are not on Mendix 5 or do not have data in their Teamserver repository will be shown a pop up message stating that the feature is only available after an upgrade.

#### Known issues
* Due to changes in AppService definitions in recent Mendix versions, developers using Mendix 5.10 or newer are recommended to use the WebService versions of the Stories and Feedback APIs. These can be found in the [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/index).

#### Removed features
* The timeline in the Planning section has been removed.
* Chat functionality has been discontinued in the Platform Portal. As we have to prioritize features carefully in order to deliver the best software we can, we've come to realize that Mendix users don't use the chat functionality very often. In order to focus our time on more heavily used existing or exciting new features, we've decided to discontinue this functionality.
