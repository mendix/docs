## Introduction

To debug the Java actions used in a Mendix microflow, you need to make some configuration changes to the way you start the Mendix Runtime. This how-to will explain how to manage this.

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Edit the server configuration
* Configure remote debugging

## Editing the Server Configuration with Extra JVM Parameters

In this section, you will learn how to configure the security at the [Prototype / demo](/howto8/security/create-a-secure-app/#prototype) level. Be aware that this level of security is only applicable for development/demo purposes. This level is available for the quick development of demo applications. It simulates security without the more complex configuration of data access. When deploying to the [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/), setting [Production](/howto8/security/create-a-secure-app/#production) security is mandatory.

To edit the server configuration with extra JVM parameters, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Project Settings](/refguide8/project-settings/).
2. Edit the configuration on the **Configurations** tab.
3. Go to the **Server** tab of the configuration, add the following line to the **Extra JVM parameters** field: `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005`

4. Run your application.

## Configuring Remote Debugging

In your Java IDE, you need to configure remote debugging.

To configure IntelliJ, follow these steps:

1. Start the **Debugger**.
2. Place some breakpoints in your Java code.
3. Start debugging.

To configure Eclipse, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Eclipse.
2. Open the menu with the bug icon or the **Run** menu.
3. Select **Debug Configurations**.
4. In the left menu bar, select **Remote Java Application**.
5. Right-click **New**.
6. Be sure your current project is under **Project**, and change the port to 5005 (view the JVM parameters).
7. Click **Debug**.
