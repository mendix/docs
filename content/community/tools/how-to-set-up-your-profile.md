## 1 Introduction

So you’ve decided to check out your new Mendix Community Profile page, but you've found it suspiciously empty. Don’t worry, we're here to help you set up your profile so you can show the world what a real Mendix developer looks like!

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up your Community Profile
* Make your profile public
* Merge your accounts

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Open a Mendix account (register [here](https://www.mendix.com/try-now/))

## 3 Editing Your Public Profile<a name="publicprofile"></a>

The first thing you need to do is edit your [Community Profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/profile) page. To get there, hover over your picture in the right side of the navigation bar and select **MY COMMUNITY PROFILE**.

Your profile will open on the **My Public Profile** tab, which is the main page of your profile with your Mendix badges, Mendix points, personal **Summary**, **Industry Experience**, **Skills**, **Project Roles**, **Activity**, **Projects**, and other details.

Your points are located in the upper-left corner of your public profile. The table and chart present the division of your points between various Mendix products and activities. For details on gaining points, see the [Points System FAQ](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/faq). And check out the **Leaderboards** tab to see the top Mendix community contributors!

When you access your profile page through the **MY COMMUNITY PROFILE** link, your profile will automatically be in edit mode so that you can easily make updates. 

To edit a field on your profile, click this icon:

If you access your profile by clicking **Community** > [OUR COMMUNITY](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/community) in the navigation bar and then find your profile on the **Developers** or **Leaderboards** tabs, your public profile will be displayed. Click **Edit Profile** to go into edit mode:

In the header of your profile, you can edit the following details:

* **Name**
* **Function**
* **Location**
* **Country**
* Whether you are looking for a **job**, a **project**, both, or neither
*  Your social media links (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Skype)

For more information on gaining Mendix points, see the [Points System FAQ](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/faq) and [How to Contribute to the Mendix Documentation](../documentation/contribute-to-the-mendix-documentation#GainingMendixPoints).

In the body of your profile, you can edit the following elements:

* **Summary**
* **Industry Experience**
* **Skills**
* **Reviews** – URLs of the reviews of Mendix you have written at [Gartner Peer Insights](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/mobile-application-development-platforms/vendor/mendix) and [TrustRaduius](https://www.trustradius.com/products/mendix/reviews)
    * Links to these reviews will not appear on your public profile, but these two reviews are required to make your profile 100% complete
* **Projects** – for details on adding a project, see [4 Adding a Project](#project)

Be sure to complete the following items, because these are necessary to make your Community Profile public:

* Add an avatar
* Enter a **Function**
* Enter a **Location**
* Confirm if you are looking for a **job**, a **project**, both, or neither
* Enter a **Summary**
* Add at least 1 **Skill**
* Add at least 1 **Industry Experience** item

Once you have have met those requirements, click **View Public Profile** in the header to see how your public profile looks:

If you have not been able to complete all of these steps, the **Profile Completeness** bar and **Profile Completion Tips** will remind you of what needs to be done to make your Community Profile complete:

## 5 Merging Your Accounts

With use of the Community Profile, you can merge your old Mendix account(s) into your current Mendix account. This action combines all your hard-earned points, certifications, and achievements in your efforts to climb the leaderboards.

There are five quick and easy steps to merge your accounts:

1. Go to your [Community Profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/ownprofile/).
2. Click **Merge Account** on the right side of the screen.
3. Under **Merge your accounts**, enter the email address of the account you want to merge with your current account.
4. Click the send button to send a merge request.

We’ll take things from there. The email address of the merged account will be shown in this list when the accounts have been merged:

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/merge.png)

{{% alert type="info" %}}

With this action we only combine the accounts. We don’t deactivate the old account(s). This should be done by that company’s administrator.
