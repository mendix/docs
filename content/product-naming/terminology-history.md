## AppCloud & AppCloudServices

This was used to described a large part of the functionality of the Developer Portal. The original idea of AppCloud can be found in this [press release](https://www.mendix.com/press/new-mendix-appcloud/). It is no longer used in describing the product.

There are still some references to the (deprecated) [AppCloudServices](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/934/) module (which is named after the AppCloud concept). This is now replaced by the MendixSSO single sign-on module.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use. Use **Developer Portal** for AppCloud. Use specific SSO-related terminology if you are referring to the SSO capabilities.
{{% /alert %}}

## Cloud Portal {#cloud-portal}

This is an internal term and should not be used in the documentation or publicly, as it has not been agreed on or branded. It no longer appears in the Mendix Documentation or *Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide*.

Deployment facilities should be described within the name/context of the [Mendix Developer Portal](main-product-names#devportal) (for example, "deployment via the Developer Portal"). Describing the functionality should avoid using any "portal" language and emphasize the action of "deploying an app to the Mendix Cloud."

## Community Edition {#community-edition}

The Mendix Community Edition was introduced with Mendix 5.18, which included the ability to deploy a Free App. This was replaced by the [Mendix Free Edition (DX Release)](https://www.mendix.com/blog/powering-continuous-innovation-with-the-mendix-free-edition/) in 2015, a move which was reinforced by [announcements at Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Replaced by [Free Edition](other-terms#free-edition).

## launchpad

The launchpad was part of the AppCloud release described in this [press release](https://www.mendix.com/press/new-mendix-appcloud/). This was also the only place where Mendix single sign-on users could be managed.

Access to the launchpad has been removed from the Developer Portal. Some of the functionality was replaced by the [App User Management](/developerportal/settings/general-settings#managing-app-users) page.
