## Sending Queued Messages

For sending queued messages to work, you need to ensure that the scheduled event `PushQueue` is active. For TAP environments, you need to explicitly activate the scheduled event in the Mendix Developer Portal. For free apps, the scheduled events feature is not supported, so a queued message won't be sent.
