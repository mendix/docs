## 1 Introduction

The charts widget provides a basic implementation of different types of chart (for example: area, line, bar, column, and pie) in a Mendix application.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a chart with basic sample data

* Configure the chart display options

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Download the latest [Charts Widget](/appstore/widgets/charts) from the Mendix App Store

## 3 Implementing the Charts Widget in an Existing Project

In this section, you will create a chart with basic sample data.

## 3.1 Setting up the Domain Model

To use the Charts widget, a specific data structure is set up. This is defined by entities and attributes in the domain model.

1. Create a new module called **charts**.

2. Configure your domain model to contain an entity **Value** with a string attribute **xValue** and a decimal attribute **yValue**.

## 3.2 Creating a Data Entry Page

To create a basic data entry page from which the Charts widget will fetch data, follow these steps:

1. Right Click on value entity.

2. Select **Generate overview pages**.

3. Add the **Value_NewEdit** page to user navigation.

## 3.3 Adding the Charts Widget to a New Page

1. Create a page named *ShowChart*.

2. Add it to the user navigation.

3. Add a **Data view** to this page that contains the **Value** entity and has a microflow as a data source.

4. Create a new microflow named **DS_NewValue** to fill the data view.

5. Right-click the data view and select **Go to microflow**.

6. In the new **DS_NewValue** microflow, create a new *Value* object and set that object as the return.

7. On the ShowChart page, add the widget **Area chart**.

8. The final page should look like this.
