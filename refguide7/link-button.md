## General properties

### Link type

This specifies the type of action triggered when pressing the button. The following table shows the options.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Web | Navigate to a web site URL. |
| Email | Compose an e-mail. |
| Call | Start a phone call. |
| Text | Send a text message. |

_Default value:_ Web

### Address

The address property is used differently depending on the chosen link type. It is used either as a URL (Web), as an email address (Email), or as a phone number (Call/Text).

The address can be set to either a literal value, or an attribute value.

### Address value

If a literal value is chosen for the address, you can enter the value here.

### Address attribute

If an attribute is chosen for the address, you can select the attribute here. An address attribute specifies a path to an attribute. The path starts at the entity of the data view in which the link button is contained.
