## 1 Introduction

This how-to takes you through the basics of development in Mendix and teaches you how to build a simple human resources management (HRM) app.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create an app
* Manage an app
* Deploy an app

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Create a [Mendix account](https://www.mendix.com/try-now/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=signup)

## 3 Creating Your App

To create your app, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Mendix Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) and log in if you are not already logged in.

2. Make sure you have downloaded the latest Desktop Modeler from the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/modelers/) and installed it. Note that this tutorial was created with Mendix Desktop Modeler 7.2.0.
3. Go to the [Build an HR Management app](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/61166/) in the Mendix App Store and click **Download**.
4. Open the app project with the Mendix **VersionSelector**. Note that this tutorial was created with Desktop Modeler 7.2.0.
5. Choose a directory for extracting the app project package.
6. If the **Version Not Found** dialog box opens, select the Desktop Modeler version with which you want to open the app project (it is best to use the latest version you have installed), and click **Open with selected Modeler version**. When the Desktop Modeler opens, select **Convert in-place** for the app project to open in your selected Modeler version.

When your app is loaded into the Desktop Modeler, you will find the **Project Explorer** pane on the left side. This pane lists all of the developer content of your app. You can add pages, logic, and other content here.
