## Menu Items Overview

The **Help** menu items are described in the table below:

| Menu Item (Shortcut Key)    | Description                                                  |

| **Ask a Question**          | Opens the Mendix Community in the default web browser.       |
| **Support Tools**           | Provides tools that can be used to share with Mendix Support, especially when you encounter issues with performance or high memory consumption. Support tools include the following:<br> <ul><li>[Performance Logging](/refguide/performance-logging/) – logs performance measurements to key functionalities (such as opening and closing microflow editors and moving items around in the App Explorer) that can help identify performance degradations.</li> <li>[Profiling](/refguide/profiling/) – runs a performance profiler session from within Studio Pro without installing the actual profiler on your machine. This session generates a report written to disk, which you can then send to the Mendix Support teams. </li> <li>**Optimize MPR** *(introduced in Mendix version 10.6.0)* – starts an action that will remove allocated memory resources clean from a project file (.mpr) if they are from no longer required.</li><li>**Convert to full clone…** *(introduced in Mendix version 10.12.0)* – starts an action that will turn a [partially cloned](/refguide/clone-type/) application into full one.</li><li>**Project Context** *(introduced in Mendix version 10.13.0)* – shows a pane containing information about part of the background memory of studio pro.</li><li>**Background** *(introduced in Mendix version 10.13.0)* – shows a pane containing information about current and previous background tasks.</li></ul> |
| **Open Log File Directory** | Opens the log files written by Studio Pro that can be used to see what might be the reason something went wrong in Studio Pro. Studio Pro retains these logs for the last 30 days, with files organized from the most recent to the oldest. Log files can also be used to share with Mendix Support when you submit a ticket. |
| **About Mendix Studio Pro** | Shows information about the current version of Mendix Studio Pro. |
