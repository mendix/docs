## 1 Introduction

The [HTML Element](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/204843) widget allows a developer to create custom HTML elements to build custom structures, visualizations, or interactions. The widget can also execute advanced text formatting, build custom UI components, and embed HTML.

To see the component in the Mendix Marketplace, click here:

The HTML Element widget contains settings to define the HTML tag, HTML attributes, events, and repeat elements. This widget can be nested and combined with other widgets.

### 1.1 Features

## 2 Configuration

To configure this widget, follow these steps:

1. In Studio Pro, place the HTML Element widget where you want your custom HTML Element to be visible.
2. Double-click the HTML Element widget to open the **Edit HTML Element** dialog box.
3. Configure the widget using the properties described in the sections below.

### 2.1 General Tab

#### 2.1.1 HTML Element Section

* **Tag name** – sets the type of the element (such as div, span, or img). If you would like to add a custom name for the element, select **Use custom name** in the drop-down menu.
* **Repeat element**
    * **Yes** – if selected, repeats the element for each item in the data source assigned.
    * **No** (default) – if selected, the element is rendered once. 
* **Content**
    * **Container for widgets** (default) – if selected, the widget acts as a container for other widgets.
    * **HTML** – if selected, uses custom HTML markup as defined in the HTML settings. 
* **HTML** (Visible if **Content** option is set to **HTML**) – can be either an expression or a text template. This defines custom HTML markup for the widget, therefore the value should be valid HTML as it will be inserted as HTML element content.

#### 2.1.2 HTML Attributes Section

* **Attributes** – sets the attributes to be assigned into the HTML element.
