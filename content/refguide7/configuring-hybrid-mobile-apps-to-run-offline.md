[Hybrid apps](developing-hybrid-mobile-apps) are built in either connected or [offline](offline) mode. This allows you to maintain two mobile device profiles: one for users who are always online, and one for users with intermittent connectivity. The Developer Portal builds connected apps by default. Configuring a hybrid app to run in offline-enabled mode can be done in the Developer Portal in the [Mobile App](/developerportal/deploy/mobileapp) section by checking the **Enable offline capabilities?** setting.
