## 1 Introduction

Using Parallels, you can run Mendix Studio Pro on your Mac device using a Windows virtual machine. To start making Mendix native apps on your Mac, follow this how-to.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Configure your Windows virtual machine for Mendix Studio Pro
* Run a Mendix app on a test device using your Windows virtual machine
* Make changes to your app, then view those changes on your test device

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Install [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/), install Windows when prompted by Parallels, and create a Windows virtual machine
* Install Mendix Studio Pro on your Windows virtual machine

## 3 Configuring Your Windows Virtual Machine for Mendix Studio Pro

To configure your Windows virtual machine to work with Mendix Studio Pro, follow these steps:

1.  Open your Parallels **Control Center**:

2. Click the **gear** symbol to open the **Configuration Panel**.
3.  Navigate to the **Hardware** tab, and select **Network** from the left panel:

4. Make sure **Source** is set to **Shared Network**.
5. Make sure that both the **Inbound** bandwidth and **Outbound** bandwidth show **unlimited**.
	If this is not the case, either enable **Network Conditioner** and set it to a profile that does not limit bandwidth, or click the **Options** tab then the **Optimization** pane and set **Resource usage** to **No limit**.
6.  In the Parallels drop-down menu, select **Preferences**:

7.  Navigate to the **Network** tab, and select **Shared** from the left panel:

8.  Click the **+** button and add two ports â€” one for 8080 and one for 8083, both forwarded to your Windows virtual machine (the 8083 port is only necessary for developing native mobile apps):

	{{% image_container width="450" %}}![plus button](attachments/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac/port-setup.png){{% /image_container %}}

	After adding those two ports, your **Port forwarding rules** should look like this:

Congratulations! You have successfully configured port forwarding to enable testing Mendix apps with your Mac. 

## 4 Viewing Your App on Your Testing Device

Whenever you create or open a Mendix app in Mendix Studio Pro, be sure to do so from a mapped drive instead of a network drive:

* Correct mapped drives will always have a letter at the start of their file location:

	{{% image_container width="450" %}}![mapped drive](attachments/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac/mapped-drive.png){{% /image_container %}}

* Incorrect network drives will always have **\\** at the start of their file location:

	{{% image_container width="450" %}}![network drive](attachments/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac/network-drive.png){{% /image_container %}}

When running your app on your test device, you cannot use the QR code within Mendix Studio Pro's **View Mobile App** dialog box:

{{% image_container width="400" %}}![view mobile app](attachments/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac/view-mobile-app.png){{% /image_container %}}

Instead, you must enter your Mac's IP address into your Make It Native app. To run your app on your test device, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure your test device and Mac are on the same Wi-Fi network.
2. Place your cursor over your Wi-Fi symbol in your system tray, then and click while holding <kbd>Option</kbd> to see your Mac's advanced network information. You will see your **IP Address** in this drop-down menu.
3.  In your Make It Native app's **Host** field, type *{your IP address}:8080*:

	{{% image_container width="400" %}}![ip in dev app](attachments/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac/ip-in-dev-app.png){{% /image_container %}}

4. Tap **Launch** to view your app.

Congratulations! You have successfully viewed your app on a test device.

## 5 Viewing Changes to Your App on Your Testing Device

For information on how to change to your app and then see that change on your device, see the [Viewing Changes to Your App on Your Testing Device](getting-started-with-native-mobile#viewingchanges) section in *Get Started with Native Mobile*.
