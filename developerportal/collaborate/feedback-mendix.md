## 1 Introduction

Within Mendix there are two use cases for the Feedback Widget:

1. To provide feedback on your own App.
2. To provide feedback on the Apps of Mendix.

The purpose of the feedback on Mendix is to provide low priority issues, questions and ideas on how to improve the Mendix Platform.
