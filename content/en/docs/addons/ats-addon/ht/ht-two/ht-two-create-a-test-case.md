## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how to create a test case, add test steps manually, and add test steps using the ATS Recorder. A test case consists of test steps that contain actions. Each action (like clicking a button) performs a task.

This how-to uses the Mendix Company Expenses app as an example, and you will create a test case that submits a new expense in this app. You create the same test case twice, once manually, and once with the ATS Recorder. 

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a new test case
* Add test steps to your test case manually
* Add test steps using the ATS Recorder

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

*  Read [How to Get Started](/addons/ats-addon/ht-two-getting-started/)
*  Read [How to Install the ATS Helper and ATS Recorder](/addons/ats-addon/ht-two-install-ats-helper-recorder/)

## 3 Creating a Test Case {#creating-a-test-case}

To create a test case, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in ATS and go to **Test Cases**.
2.  Click the **Action** drop-down menu and click **New Test Case**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/repository-add-test-case.png" >}}
  
    Clicking **New Test Case** opens the **Create new** dialog box:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/repository-create-new.png" >}}
  
3. Enter a name in the **Name** field (for example, *TC - 001.01 - Create new Expense (Manually)*). Using a predefined naming structure is advised.    
5. Enter a description in the **Description** field (for example, *This test case creates a new expense in the company expenses app.*). Giving each test case a description of what it does is advised.
6.  Click **Create**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/repository-create-new-test-case-e.png" >}}

    This opens the **Test Case** page. ATS displays the **Name** and **Description** on this page.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/test-case-page.png" >}}

## 4 Adding Test Steps Manually

The following steps describe how to add test steps manually to your test case. You will add the steps necessary for creating a new expense in the Company Expenses app.

1.  Click **Setup step manually** on the **Test Case** page. This opens the **Select function or action** dialog box where you find all actions and functions:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/test-case-page-add.png" >}}

    The first step is opening the Company Expenses app, which you do by entering a URL in the browser. ATS does the same by using the [Open Application](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-open-application/) action.

2. Enter *Open Mendix Application* in the input area of the dialog box. You have the core action and Mendix actions. Mendix actions are preferred over core actions, so select the Mendix action to open the application. 

    {{% alert color="info" %}} Enter terms like *Find*, *Click*, *Set*, *Assert*, and *Get* to find the right action. {{% /alert %}}

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/test-case-page-open-application.png" >}}

    ATS now creates a test step with the open application action. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/test-case-page-open-application-added.png" >}}

3. Enter a description of the test step in the **Describe Test Step** text box (for example, *Open the company expenses app*).

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/test-case-page-add-description.png" >}}

4. Add the URL of the application you want to test by clicking the drop-down of the input parameter **Application URL**. In the dropdown select the **Environment URL** below the **Global constant**. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/open-input-value-dropdown.png" >}}
  
    ATS now uses the application URL you select in the **Run Configuration** application.
    
5.  After opening the application, you must log in. ATS has a standard login action for logging in to a Mendix application that you must use, which is the [login](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-login/) action. The login page of the company expenses app looks like this:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/comp-app-login-page.1.png" >}}

6. Inside your test case, click **Setup step manually** again and add the **Login** action:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/add-login.png" >}}

7. Add a description in **Describe your test step here**.
8. Click the **Username** input parameter drop-down menu and add the username. 
9.  Click the **Password** input parameter drop-down menu and add the password:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/login-input-parameters-e.png" >}}

10. After you log in to the Company Expenses app, you see the homepage. To create a new expense, click **New Expense** in the app. This means that ATS must click the button. To get the information you need, open the ATS Helper and hover over the **New Expense** button while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/helper-new-expense-button.png" >}}

11. ATS has an action that clicks a widget, which is the [Click Widget](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-click-widget/) action. Inside your test case, click **Setup step manually** again and add the **Click Widget** action.
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/click-widget-new-expense.png" >}}

12. Add a description in **Describe your test step here**.
13. Click the drop-down of the **Widget Name** input parameter.

14. Add the widget name displayed in the ATS Helper.

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-input-parameter-edited.png" >}}

15. After clicking **New Expense** in the Company Expenses app, a dialog box opens called **New Expense**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-dialog.png" >}}

16. The user visually confirms that the dialog box appears. ATS has an action that finds and asserts a dialog box, which is the [Find/Assert Dialog](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-findassert-dialog/) action. Inside your test case, click **Setup step manually** again and add the **Find/Assert Dialog** action.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-dialog-action.png" >}}

17. Add a description in **Describe your test step here**.
18. Click the **Dialog Title** input parameter and add the title of the dialog box:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-dialog-action-filled.png" >}}

19. To complete an expense, you must enter an **Amount**, **Type**, and **Description**, and then **Save & Submit** the expense:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-dialog-fields.png" >}}

20. The **Amount** field is a text box widget, the **Type** field is a reference selector widget, and the **Description** field is a text area widget. ATS can interact with all these widgets using the [Set Value](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-set-value/) action. Inside your test case, click **Setup step manually** and add the **Set Value** action. Then, select the test step with the **Set Value** action, click **Copy**, and click **Paste**.
21. Repeat the copy and paste step of the test step with the **Set value** action. Now you have a test step for each field.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/three-set-value-actions.png" >}}

22. Use the ATS Helper on the **Amount** field in the Company Expenses app. Open test step 5 in your test case by clicking the test step, filling in a test step description, entering the **Widget Name**, and entering  the **Value**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/set-value-amount-field.png" >}}

23. Use the ATS Helper on the **Type** field in the Company Expenses app. Open test step 6 in your test case, fill in a test step description, enter the **Widget Name**, and enter the **Value**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/set-value-type-field.png" >}}

24. Use the ATS Helper on the **Description** field in the Company Expenses app. Open test step 7 in your test case, fill in a test step description, enter the **Widget Name**, and enter the **Value**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/set-value-description-field.png" >}}

25. To submit the new expense, you must click the **Save & Submit** button:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-save-submit.png" >}}

26. Inside your test case, click **Setup step manually**, add the **Click Widget** action, fill in a test step description, and enter the **Widget Name**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/click-widget-save-submit.png" >}}

27.  You must confirm that the expense is successfully submitted. In the Company Expenses app, a submitted expense appears in the data grid. ATS can assert the new expense with the [Find/Assert DataGrid Row](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-findassert-datagrid-row/) action. Inside your test case, click **Setup step manually** and add the **Find/Assert Datagrid Row** action.
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/add-findassert-datagrid-row-new-expense.png" >}}

28. Now use the ATS Helper to find the **Widget Name** of the data grid in the Company Expenses app:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/widget-name-datagrid-new-expense.png" >}}

29. Use the ATS Helper to find the **Column Name** of the **Description** column:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/column-name-datagrid-new-expense.png" >}}

30. Now add a description for the **Find/Assert DataGrid Row** action, click the parameters, and add the correct information:

    * The **Widget Name** parameter with the widget name
    * The **Column 1 Name** parameter with the column name
    * The **Column 1 Value** parameter with the description
      

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/findassert-datagrid-row-new-expense-parameters.png" >}}

31. The last step of your test case is to end your user session by logging out. ATS has two ways for logging out of your application:

    * ATS clicks the **Logout** button
    * ATS uses the [Logout](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-logout/) action 
    
    The Logout action is a hard logout, meaning that no matter where ATS is inside your application, it always logs out. Inside your test case, click **Setup step manually** and add the **Logout** action.
   
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/add-logout-new-expense.png" >}}

    You have added all the test steps for your test case:
  
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/all-test-steps-new-expense.png" >}}
  
32. The last thing to do is to clarify to ATS what you are testing. This is done by setting the **Call Type** of your test steps to one of the following:

    * **Setup** for all the steps that you must perform to get to the test situation
    * **Regular** for all the steps that are part of your test situation
    * **Teardown** for all the steps that are necessary for cleaning up
    
    
  Test step 1 and test step 2 must have the **Call Type: Setup**. Test steps 3-9 must have the **Call Type: Regular**. Test step 10 must have the **Call Type: Teardown**.
    
{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/call-type-new-expense.png" >}}
    
    You have now manually created your test case.

## 5 Adding Test Steps Using the ATS Recorder

The following steps describe how to add test steps to your test case using the [ATS Recorder](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-recorder/). You add the steps necessary for creating a new expense in the Company Expenses app. Create a new test case by completing [Creating a Test Case](#creating-a-test-case) before starting with this section.

To add test steps using the ATS Recorder, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Record step** on the **Test Case** page:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/record-test-case-page.png" >}}

    This opens the **Recording Session** page:
    
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/recording-session-page.png" >}}

2.  Open a new page in your browser and enter the URL of your Mendix app. When you go back to ATS, you see that ATS recorded the URL and the Open Application action:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/open-application-comp-app-recorded.png" >}}

3.  Next go back to the Company Expenses app and enter your login credentials. 
4.  Click the **New Expense** button.
5.  Enter an expense amount in the **Amount** field.
6.  Enter an expense type in the **Type** field.
7.  Enter an expense description in the **Description** field.
8.  Click the **Save & Submit** button.
9.  Inside the data grid, click the description in the **Description** column of your expense to simulate an assert:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/expense-description-datagrid-column.png" >}}

10. Click the **Sign Out** button. On the **Recording Session** page, you see that all the steps are recorded by ATS:
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/recording-session-new-expense.png" >}}
  
11.  Click **Save** to save the test steps into your test case:
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/save-button-recording-session.png" >}}

12.  You must set the input parameter **Application URL** of the **Open Application** action for the **Global Constant** (**Application URL**):

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/global-constant-open-application.png" >}}

13.  You must manually add the **New Expense** dialog box (you cannot record this). You must add the action between test step 3 and test step 4. A user visually confirms that the dialog box appears. ATS has an action that finds and asserts a dialog box, which is the [Find/Assert Dialog](/addons/ats-addon/rg-one-findassert-dialog/) action. Inside your test case, hover over step 3 and click **Add Below**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/Add-test-step.png" >}}

14. Add the **Find/Assert Dialog** action.

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-dialog-action1.png" >}}

    Note that you can also add actions manually between recording sessions.

14.  Add a description in **Describe your test step here**.
15. Click the **Dialog Title** input parameter and add the title of the dialog box:
    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/new-expense-dialog-action-input-parameters-recorder.png" >}}

15.  For the logout, you can choose to keep the recorded click the **Sign Out** button or replace it with the **Logout** action.
16.  The last thing to do is to clarify to ATS what you are testing. This is done by setting the **Call Type** of your test steps to one of the following:
  
    * **Setup** for all the steps that you must perform to get to the test situation
    * **Regular** for all the steps that are part of your test situation
    * **Teardown** for all steps that are necessary to clean up
    
    
    Test steps 1 and 2 must have **Call Type: Setup**. Test steps 3–9 must have **Call Type: Regular**. Test step 10 must have **Call Type: Teardown**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-create-a-test-case/call-type-new-expense-recorder.png" >}}

You have now created your test case using the ATS Recorder.

We advise you to use the recorder as much as possible to add test steps. But, the ATS Recorder might not be able to record certain manual test steps. So, we advise to add steps in the following order:
* Record your manual test steps using the ATS Recorder
* Adding test steps using the ATS Helper, see [Finding the action you need](/addons/ats-addon/bp-two-finding-the-action-you-need/).
* Create a custom action, see [Create custom action](/addons/ats-addon/ht-two-create-custom-actions/).
