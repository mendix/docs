## Purpose of This Guide

This guide presents the main Mendix product names, other Mendix terms, and partner terms currently being used in the Mendix Platform UI, the [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/), and the [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/). 

The purpose of this guide is to provide guidelines on usage, capitalization, and spelling as well as notes on important details and [terminology history](terminology-history) where necessary. The goal of providing and applying these guidelines is to reach company-wide consensus on usage.

The purpose of this guide is not to provide a definition for each term. Terminology details are only given here for clarification where necessary. Product definitions are found throughout the [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/) and [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/), and for the sake of maintenance, they are not duplicated or summarized here.

For a term to be included in this guide, it should already appear in the Mendix Platform UI, Mendix Documentation, and/or Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide.

A term may not already be included in this guide for the following reasons:

* There are no specific usage guidelines or decisions on the term (at least not yet)
* It is a generic term, not branded by Mendix (for example, "domain model," "page," "template," or "layout")
* It is an internal-only term (for example, names of apps or technical terms only used on R&D teams)
* The term does not feature uniquely enough in the UI to require usage guidelines (for example, on capitalization in documentation)
* The term is outdated (meaning, usage of it has been decided against; for examples, see [Terminology History](terminology-history))
* The term should not be used in customer-facing resources
