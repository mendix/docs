## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com/index3.html) is where the Mendix Community comes together to help each other out with questions and answers and to propose ideas for improving the Mendix Platform.

The forum is closely integrated with the Community Profile so that Mendix community members can see all the interesting and useful information about who is participating in the forum. If someone clicks your name anywhere on the forum, your Community Profile will open, so make sure you set your profile to public so everyone can see your details and progress!

There are two tabs available in the Mendix Forum: **Questions** and **Ideas**. On each tab, you can see the **Top contributors**, which lists the five Mendix community developers who have the most Mendix Forum points in the last 30 days.

## 2 Questions Tab<a name="QuestionsTab"></a>

### 2.1 Questions Overview

On the **Questions** tab, you can see an overview of the questions that have been asked.

Here is an example of a question on the overview page:
