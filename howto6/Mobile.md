Our vision for mobile app development is that enterprises can greatly benefit from a single platform that supports the various styles of mobile app development (web, native and hybrid) for multiple devices and provides common mobile back-end services.

The rapid evolution of standards like HTML and the wide adoption of frameworks to bridge the native device functions provide an ever-richer user experience for cross-platform apps. And from a logic perspective, JavaScript is powerful as a platform-independent, backend technology, even in native clients. Thereâ€™s a shift going on from native languages towards JavaScript, where JavaScript gets more and more embedded in native programming languages to raise the level of re-usability of code across platforms.
