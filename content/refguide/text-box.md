## 1 Introduction

A text box is used to display and, optionally, allow the end-user to edit the value of an attribute from an object in a textual form. It can be used to display attributes of the following [data types](data-types):

* Autonumber
* Decimal
* Hashed string
* Integer
* Long
* String

A text box must be placed in a [data widget](data-widgets) and displays an attribute of the object(s) retrieved by that widget. The name of the attribute to be displayed is shown inside the text box, between square brackets, and colored blue.

For example, the following text box allows the end-user to see, and set, the **Name** of a customer.

## 2 Properties

An example of text box properties is represented in the image below:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![](attachments/text-box/text-box-properties.png)
{{% /image_container %}}

Text box properties consist of the following sections:

* [Common](#common)
* [Data source](#data-source)
* [Design Properties](#design-properties)
* [Editability](#editability)
* [Events](#events)
* [Formatting](#formatting)
* [General](#general)
* [Label](#label)
* [Validation](#validation)
* [Visibility](#visibility)

### 2.1 Common Section{#common}

### 2.2 Data Source Section{#data-source}

{{% snippet file="refguide/data-source-section-link.md" %}}

### 2.3 Design Properties Section{#design-properties}

{{% snippet file="refguide/design-section-link.md" %}} 

### 2.4 Editability Section{#editability}

{{% snippet file="refguide/editability-section-link.md" %}}

### 2.5 Events Section{#events}

#### 2.5.1 On Change Event{#on-change}

The on change event property specifies an action that will be executed when the value has been changed and gets submitted. A value will be submitted when pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or leaving the widget, either by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or by clicking another widget.

{{% snippet file="refguide/events-section-link.md" %}}

#### 2.5.2 On Enter Event

The on enter event property specifies an action that will be executed when the widget is entered, either by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or by clicking it with the mouse.

{{% snippet file="refguide/events-section-link.md" %}}

#### 2.5.3 On Leave Event

The on leave event property specifies an action that will be executed when leaving the widget, either by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or by clicking another widget.

This differs from the [On change](#on-change) property in that the event will always be triggered, even if the value has not been changed.

#### 2.5.4 On Enter Key Press Event

The on enter key press event property specifies an action that will be executed when the focus is inside the widget  and the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key is pressed. In a web application the widget will keep focus after the action gets executed.

### 2.6 Formatting Section{#formatting}

The formatting section applies only to the way that numeric attributes are displayed. These are attributes of the following data types:

* Decimal
* Integer
* Long

{{% snippet file="refguide/numeric-formatting-link.md" %}}

### 2.7 General Section{#general}

#### 2.7.1 Show as Password

Attributes of the data type `String` or `Hashed string` can have their value hidden. This can be used for passwords, for example, to prevent bystanders from seeing them.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| False *(default)*| Normal text box |
| True | Typed characters are not shown to the end-user , instead an asterisk is shown for every typed character |

#### 2.7.2 Input Mask

{{% alert type="info" %}}Input masks are not supported on native mobile pages.

Input masks are designed for string data types. Be cautious when using them with numeric or hashed string data types.
{{% /alert %}}

The input mask limits what the end-user can enter in the text box, following the rules below:

| Character | Allows Input of |
| ----- | ----- |
| `9` | any digit |
| `Z` | any letter |
| `U` | an upper-case letter |
| `L` | a lower-case letter |
| `*` | a letter *or* a digit |

Other characters will be taken literally.

For example, the input mask `99-LLL-9999` matches `24-apr-2008`.

#### 2.7.3 Maximum Length

This property specifies the maximum number of characters that can be typed in this text box.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute length *(default)* | The maximum number of characters is the same as the maximum length of the connected attribute |
| Unlimited | The maximum number of characters is unlimited |
| Custom | The maximum number of characters is specified in the widget properties |

#### 2.7.4 Placeholder Text

The placeholder text is shown when no text has been entered yet, or when a displayed attribute is empty.

It can be used, for example, to give a hint to the end-user what kind of text should be entered.

<a name="label-properties"></a>
