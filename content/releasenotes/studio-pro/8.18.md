{{% alert type="info" %}}
This is the [LTS](lts-mts#lts) version 8 release for apps in production.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
There is an issue with installing Studio Pro for the first time due to inability to automatically download the Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable (x64). This does not occur if you already have the redistributable or Studio Pro installed. Workaround: Download and install [Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable (x64)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x64.exe), then install Studio Pro.

## 8.18.8 {#8188}

**Release date: June 30th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.8" %}}

### Improvements

* The date range search field of a data grid now allows the upper and lower bounds to be inclusive. (Ticket 119173)
* We improved how the native [drop-down](/refguide8/drop-down) widget renders menu items on larger devices. (Ticket 122196)
* We improved the startup of the runtime by not registering handlers for REST, OData, and web services when the model does not contain any REST, OData, or web services, respectively. This has several advantages: it makes your app start up slightly faster, there are fewer log messages at startup, and it follows the security best practice of endpoint hardening.
* We now log the addition of request handlers and WebSocket endpoints.
* We improved the performance of the **Build deployment structure** step when building your app. The time needed for **Exporting pages** decreased up to 60%, and **Exporting metadata** decreased up to 90%.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where extracting a microflow as a sub-microflow with a loop that had multiple parameters did not  set the parameters correctly on the extracted sub-microflow. (Tickets 97103, 110679)
* We fixed an issue where extra newlines were added to the end of an expression when typing in the expression editor. (Tickets 101033, 103209, 105990, 107049, 107239, 114492, 115807, 115894, 116692, 116963, 118606, 119602, 122468)
* We fixed an issue where temporary files and folders (like **GPUCache**) were created in the app directory, which led to unnecessary merge conflicts. (Tickets 105909, 106329, 107857)
* We fixed an error that occurred when a conditional editability expression referenced a non-existent attribute when the widget was non-editable due to its parent container (for example, a list view or data view). (Ticket 121857)
* We fixed an issue that occurred when multiple rows were selected in the **Changes** pane and copied to the Windows clipboard via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, but only some of the rows were copied multiple times. (Ticket 123191)
* We upgraded the SQL Server JDBC driver authentication DLL files to 9.2.1. (Ticket 124044)
* We fixed an issue where MxAssist Logic Bot sent a common flow type to the server to make a suggestion instead of the exact type.
* We fixed a crash that occurred when conflicts after an [update or merge](/refguide8/using-version-control-in-studio-pro) were only present on the files in the app folder and not on the app itself.

### Deprecations

* We dropped support for the following database versions that are no longer supported by vendors:
	* Oracle 18
	* SQL Server 2016

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.

* The license server now respects the JVM proxy options: *https.proxyHost*, *https.proxyPort*, *https.proxyUser*, *https.proxyPassword*, and *http.nonProxyHosts*.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where extra new lines were added to the end of an expression when typing in the expression editor. (Tickets 101033, 103209, 105990, 107049, 107239, 115807, 115894, 116692, 116963, 118606, 119602, 122468)
* We fixed an issue where it was not possible to navigate through a multi-select search field on a data grid using the keyboard. (Ticket 122123)
* We fixed an issue where the return key on the iOS keyboard on a data grid search field was not triggering the search. (Ticket 122129)

* We fixed an error that occurred when refreshing the list of Team Server apps in the [Open App](/refguide8/open-app-dialog) dialog box. (Ticket 112763)
* We fixed an issue where selecting an icon using the keyboard was not possible after filtering. (Ticket 104249)
* The [file manager](/refguide8/file-manager) widget when configured with **Type** > **Upload** no longer causes an unexpected error when there are validation errors in certain scenarios. (Ticket 120116)
* We fixed an issue with the [reference selector](/refguide8/reference-selector) widget when it contained conditional editability where it triggerred a microflow or database data retrieval twice. (Ticket 104322)
* We fixed a runtime issue where log messages from components that use Apache commons logging ended up on the console output of the app. These messages are no longer written to the console output of the app. We introduced a new custom setting where you can set `EnableApacheCommonsLogging` to `true` to see these log messages in the Mendix logs. (Tickets 103160, 118254)
* We improved the performance of XML imports in a transactional context. (Ticket 119050)

* We fixed an issue where MxAssist Logic Bot recommended committing a non-persistable entity.
* In some situations, the **Update** action in the [Update Widgets](/refguide8/project-menu#update-widgets) tool did not update the widget, although it was showing that it had the latest version in the overview. This has been fixed.
* We fixed an issue which prevented enabling MxAssist Logic Bot for already-opened microflow editors.
* We resolved an error that occurred when installing Studio Pro because an additional file could not be downloaded.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.

### Fixes

* We fixed a performance regression in loop execution. (Ticket 118288)
We fixed the **list subtraction** operation, which now maintains the order of items. (Ticket 117625)
* We improved the validity of sessions in session caches. As a result, changes made on one cluster node will now eventually be reflected on others. Also, `Core.getSessionById` will update the current session and related data in the current cluster node's session cache if the session validation timeout is passed. (Ticket 113448)
* We fixed an issue with the document template when a conditionally visible row was always rendered if the enclosing data view had an empty object. (Ticket 115502)

### Improvements

* When running an app without a license, the [Data Hub limitation on the number of objects](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service-requirements) no longer applies.
* We improved the performance of domain model interactions when the search functionality is used in [Data Hub](/data-hub/).
* We added a read-only **App repository address** field to the [private-server Sign In box](/refguide8/upload-to-version-control-dialog#private-server), so now you know what private repository you are connecting to. For more information, see [How to Work with an On-Premises Version Control Server](/howto8/collaboration-requirements-management/on-premises-svn-howto).
* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 9.2.0. If you use the [Database Connector](/appstore/connectors/database-connector) module with SQL Server and integrated security, you may need to update the JDBC driver in `userlib` as well.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where multiple sessions did not work as expected in offline applications when [Multiple users per session](/refguide8/project-settings#multiple-sessions) was turned off. (Ticket 113783)

* We fixed an issue in the [file manager](/refguide8/file-manager) widget that caused unexpected extensions to be invalid (for example, *.PDF*, *.pDf*). (Ticket 116909)
* Documentation in Studio Pro 9 Guide was opened via <kbd>F1</kbd> and **Help** instead of [Studio Pro 8 Guide](/refguide8/). This has been fixed.
* We fixed a bug that was causing a crash whenever an app was opened that needed to merge changes introduced from outside Studio Pro.
* We improved the process of [reverting all changes](/refguide8/version-control-menu#revert-all). You will no longer be asked to save before reverting. We also fixed a crash that occurred when you reverted while the app was running.

### Deprecations

### Fixes

* We fixed a runtime issue in [Call REST](/refguide8/call-rest-action) activities when calling endpoints that keep the connection alive. The issue occurred in Mendix Cloud v4- and AWS-hosted apps, because those environments sever connections after 6 minutes. Setting `http.client.CleanupAfterSeconds` to `355` fixes that issue, so now we use that as the default value. (Tickets 110860, 111317, 111881, 112067, 112073, 113401, 113920)

* We fixed an issue in native mobile apps where a focused text input was hidden behind the keyboard on Android devices. Make sure to also update your versions of the [Make It Native app](/releasenotes/mobile/make-it-native-app) and [Native Builder](/releasenotes/mobile/native-builder). (Ticket 113397)
* We fixed an issue where errors occurred when performing certain operations (for example, moving documents) when certain custom widgets existed in your app.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.

### New Features

#### Selective Synchronization

When building offline-first apps, there are different scenarios to prepare for, and sometimes you may want to only synchronize a single object or a small set of objects instead of all the data. Good news, we have extended the synchronization capabilities with the option to only synchronize selected objects from the device with the server. Now, the power is in your hands and the choice is yours. Use the [Synchronize](/refguide8/synchronize) activity in a nanoflow to synchronize all or selected objects (which can be both objects and files). This feature can greatly improve the user experience of your app and offers more flexibility.

For more information, see the [Synchronization](/refguide8/offline-first#synchronization) section of *Offline-First*.

#### The Future of Mobile Apps

At Mendix, we want to provide our customers with a future-proof platform, a significant part of which is always determined by underlying technology. We believe that [native mobile apps](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mobile-apps-go-native-part-i/) and [progressive web apps (PWAs)](https://www.mendix.com/mobile-architecture/#progressive-web-apps) are the future for mobile apps, in that they deliver a best-of-breed approach for building app store- and browser-based mobile apps. For more information, see the [Establishing Your Mobile Architecture Strategy](https://www.mendixworld.com/session/establishing-your-mobile-architecture-strategy/) session from last year's Mendix World.

We do not consider hybrid mobile (which is based on Cordova) to be future-proof technology anymore. Therefore, we would like to inform you that we have disabled the creation of hybrid mobile apps in this version of Studio Pro and have deprecated hybrid mobile apps in Studio Pro [9](9.0).

#### Support for Non-Filterable & Non-Sortable Attributes

We added support for attributes that cannot be used for filtering or sorting. Previously, it was not possible to consume non-filterable or non-sortable attributes. Now it is possible to consume these attributes, extending what can you do with data from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/).

To better support OData for Mendix Data Hub, we added the concept of [attribute limitations](/refguide8/attributes#limitations). Sometimes attributes in OData do not support sorting or filtering, and now Studio Pro is aware of that. Studio Pro shows an error to warn you when you do something with an attribute that is not possible, while allowing you to use the attributes for everything else.

The concept of attribute limitations is now extended to existing attribute types. This does not change their functionality (because these attribute types always had some restrictions), and now they behave the same as other non-filterable and non-sortable attributes.

### Improvements

* We added consistency checks to ensure the uniqueness of exposed names and exposed set names for published OData resources.
* We added a new way to specify which client certificate to use in the [Call REST service](/refguide8/call-rest-action) and [Call web service](/refguide8/call-web-service-action) activities.
* We improved the user interface for modeling [published OData services](/refguide8/published-odata-services) in Studio Pro. The old tree view of published attributes and associations is now a list.
* We now show the associations of [external entities](/refguide8/external-entities) in the [Data Hub pane](/refguide8/data-hub-pane). Multiple associations between the same pair of external entities are grouped together, listing individual associations in the tooltip. Unsupported associations are grayed out and show a tooltip explaining the reason.
* The [Commit](/refguide8/committing-objects) activity is now included in **Find usages** results.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where certain operations on binaries were only possible within a sudo context.
    {{% alert type="info" %}}Thanks to Marcel Groenweg for pointing this out!
    {{% /alert %}}
* We fixed an issue regarding the [Change list](/refguide8/change-list) microflow activity where if a list was set to itself, the contents were cleared. (Ticket 109243)
* We fixed several possible data synchronization issues that occurred in offline-first applications. (Ticket 101598)
* We fixed an issue where the [reference selector](/refguide8/reference-selector) widget did not show objects when used in an offline-first application. (Ticket 113384)
* We fixed an issue where a native mobile application failed to load during development. (Ticket 112952)
* We fixed an issue **View** > [Find](/refguide8/view-menu#find) did not find the text that was typed as [published REST operation](/refguide8/published-rest-operation) documentation. (Ticket 112648)
* We fixed an issue for published OData services where the app's default proxy settings were not used at runtime. (Ticket 109953)
* We fixed an issue where dynamic classes were not applied for [layout grid](/refguide8/layout-grid) rows and cells, [table](/refguide8/table) rows and cells, [scroll container](/refguide8/scroll-container) regions, and [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid) columns. We also fixed an issue where these were also not applied to the container widget. (Tickets 111048, 111810, 112312)
* When an XPath constraint used the `%CurrentObject%` token in a nested constraint, this resulted in an error in the client. This is now fixed. (Ticket 112034)
* When migrating files created before Mendix 6 to modern files, we now log the missing files instead of failing the migration. (Tickets 110317, 110969)
* We decreased the chance of deadlocks in our session administration system actions, and when deadlocks still occur, they are handled gracefully. (Ticket 111360)
* We fixed an issue that caused [Close page](/refguide8/close-page) activities to stop working after upgrading to [8.17](8.17). (Ticket 111576)
* We fixed an error where an error message appeared when you dragged a microflow onto the list of published REST operations and clicked **Cancel** on the dialog box.
* We fixed an issue in published OData services where publishing associations in a combination of entities with generalizations resulted in an incorrect contract.
* We fixed an issue where the picker element of an inline native [drop-down](/refguide8/drop-down) widget did not update on a selected value change when opened.
* We fixed an issue where the current branch was showing in the list of available branches to [merge](/refguide8/merge-dialog).

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
