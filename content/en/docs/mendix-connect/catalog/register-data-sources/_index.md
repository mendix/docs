## Introduction

Publishing developers can register services in the Catalog in different ways depending on how their apps are deployed.

Common tasks for registering data sources include the following:

* [Registering services automatically on the Mendix Cloud](/mendix-connect/catalog/register-data/#mendix-cloud)
* [Automating registration in a pipeline on a Private Cloud](/mendix-connect/catalog/automate-registration/)
* Manually uploading a metadata contract with the [Catalog UI form](/mendix-connect/catalog/register-data/#registration-form)
* [Using the Registration API](/mendix-connect/catalog/register-data/#register-services) (for any deployment method)
* [Wrap services, APIs, and databases with OData](/refguide/wrap-services-odata/)

For an overview of registering OData sources, see [Register OData Resources in the Catalog](/mendix-connect/catalog/register-data/). You can also [Register Non-OData Resources in the Catalog](/mendix-connect/catalog/register-non-odata-resources/).
