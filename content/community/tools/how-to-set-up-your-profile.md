## 1 Introduction

So you’ve to check out your new Mendix Community Profile page, but you've found it suspiciously empty. Don’t worry, we're here to help you set up your profile so you can show the world what a real Mendix developer looks like!

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up your Community Profile
* Make your profile public
* Merge your accounts

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Open a Mendix account (register [here](https://www.mendix.com/try-now/))

## 3 My Dashboard

To access your [Community Profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/profile), hover over your picture on the right side of the navigation bar and select **My Dashboard** from the context menu.

Your profile will open to the **My Dashboard** tab, where you can see your points chart. The chart and its legend present the division of your points between various Mendix products and activities. For details on gaining points, see the [Points System FAQ](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/faq). When analyzing your points, be sure to also check out the **Leaderboards** tab to see the top Mendix community contributors!

You can also see your Mendix **Activity**, which is a list of the most important public events for which you have gained Mendix points.

The other sections of your Community Profile are described below.

### 3.1 <a name="invite"></a>Inviting Friends and Colleagues to Mendix

On your dashboard, you can invite friends and colleagues to join Mendix. After you click **Invite Friends**, a pop-up window titled **Get your free t-shirt** appears where you can invite someone by entering their email address and clicking **Send invite**. There is also a personal referral link provided, which you can share on your personal website, blog, and social media channels to get more referrals. You will earn some Mendix swag with five successful invites.

After you have invited someone to Mendix, click **Invite Friends / View Status** to see their name and status listed at the bottom of the pop-up window:

1. If you invited them via email, they will first have the **Invited** status.
2. When they click **Sign up for Mendix** and receive a confirmation email, they will have the **Confirmation e-mail sent** status.
3. When they complete the guided product introduction tour in the Mendix Web Modeler, their status will change to **Successful**.

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/referral-statuses.png)

Once five of your referrals reach the **Successful** status, you will see the **Claim your t-shirt** link on your dashboard. Click this to fill in some details and receive your awesome Mendix t-shirt. Yay!

One more thing about referrals – when you refer someone and they sign up for Mendix, they will receive a voucher for the [Mendix Rapid Developer Certification Exam](https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/certification/rapid) (valid for a limited period of time). So encourage your friends to try something new and get certified by Mendix!

### 3.2 <a name="review"></a>Writing User Reviews of Mendix

Once you start using Mendix regularly and are familiar with all the capabilities of the platform, you can write user reviews on [Gartner Peer Insights](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/mobile-application-development-platforms/vendor/mendix/product/mendix-platfor), [TrustRadius](https://www.trustradius.com/products/mendix/reviews), and [G2 Crowd](https://www.g2crowd.com/products/mendix/reviews). This is another way for you to earn Mendix swag!

### 3.3 Featured Achievement

There is also a featured achievement on your profile's dashboard:

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-profile/featured-achievement.png)

The featured achievement presents a [multi-level badge](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/badges) you can strive to win by working on the Mendix Platform and completing certain tasks. The header will always feature the next badge level for you to work towards. The badges are color-coded based on their rarity, from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare).

The badges help you keep track of your progress on the Mendix Platform and what you are learning to do. And working towards gaining the badges in the featured achievement is a great way to stay engaged with the Mendix community!
