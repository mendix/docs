## 1 Introduction 

This guide lists all the properties of the Data Grid 2 widget located inside the [Data Widgets](/appstore/modules/data-widgets/) module. Because data grids also contain columns and rows, properties for those [columns](#columns) and [rows](#rows) are also described below.

For more information on using Data Grid 2 features, see [Data Grid 2](/appstore/modules/data-grid-2/).

## 2 Configuration {#data-grid2-properties}

### 2.1 General Tab

#### 2.1.1 Data Source

Data source specifies the source of the data being presented in the data grid. You can select data from **Database**, **Microflow**, **Nanoflow**, or **Association**.

#### 2.1.2 Refresh Time (in seconds)

The time (in seconds) the grid waits between refreshing the data. Auto-refreshing is turned off when the value is 0.

#### 2.1.3 Selection

This property controls row selection capabilities. Selection is turned off by default, but can be enabled by choosing ether **Single** or **Multi**:

* The **Single** selection is selection type where only one row can be selected at the time
* The **Multi** type support selecting several rows at the time

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Data grid currently supports only in-memory selection. This implies some limitation which allows selecting only visible rows. If you change a data grid page or reload the browser window, then selection will be cleared.{{% /alert %}}

#### 2.1.4 Selection Method

This property specifies the method of selection.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This property is available only when **Selection method** is set to **Single** or **Multi**.
{{% /alert %}}

The **Checkbox** method adds a checkbox to the beginning of the row, which acts as the primary way to select the row. The **Row click** method makes the whole row clickable; clicking on a row makes it selected.

#### 2.1.5 Show (Un)check All Toggle

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This property is available only when **Selection method** is set to **Checkbox** in combination with **Selection** > **Multi**.
{{% /alert %}}

When set to **Yes**, the data grid displays a checkbox in the header that, when selected, selects all visible rows. Clearing it will clear the selected rows.

### 2.2 Columns Tab {#columns}

#### 2.2.1 Columns

A list of columns displayed in the data grid. Each item in this list is a set of properties that define and control the appearance and behavior of the column. To read more about each property, see the [Column properties](#column-properties) section.

#### 2.3.2 Pagination
