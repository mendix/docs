The [Pop-Up Menu](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/115826/) widget shows a floating menu with items. The widget allows users to create their own items in "custom" mode.

### 1.1 Features

* Add your own trigger element

* Show the menu on-hover or on-click
* Change the style of each item

If you want to use dynamic content, make sure to wrap the widget in a [data view](/refguide/data-view) and configure the widget as **Render = Custom**.
