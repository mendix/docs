## 5 Welcome to the Web Modeler

Are you ready to develop your app using the Web Modeler? Let's go briefly through the interface, and we will go into detail later in this tutorial.

On the left side of the Web Moddler is the main menu. Via the icons in this menu, you can navigate to the following locations:

* **Pages** (for the UI)
* **Navigation Document** (for the menu)
* **Domain Models** (for the date structure)
* **Microflows** (for the business logic)
* **App Settings**
* **Theme Customizer**
* **Feedback**

The main window of the Web Modeler that you are currently viewing is the home page. Here you will be developing the app by editing pages, microflows, and the domain models.

On the right of the Web Modeler is the toolbox and the properties of the element you have selected in the editing area. The toolbox contains widgets, building blocks, or microflow activities that you can drag into your app.
