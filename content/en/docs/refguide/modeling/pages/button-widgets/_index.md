## 1 Introduction

Buttons perform an action when clicked. They can be rendered as a button or as a hyperlink. Buttons can be divided into the following ones:

  * Call microflow button
  * Call nanoflow button
  * Open page button
  * Save button
  * Cancel button
  * Link button
  * Close page button
  * Delete button
  * Call workflow button
	* Complete user task button
  * Show user task page button
  * Show workflow admin page button
  * Synchronize button

* **Drop-Down Button** – shows a list of items, an action is performed when one of the items is clicked. A pop-up window with a list of possible actions appears when an end-user clicks a drop-down button:
