## Introduction

A **Retrieve workflow context** activity can be used to retrieve the selected workflow context entity.

It needs the System.Workflow entity as its input. The action determines the return type based on the selected workflow (the configured Context entity of that workflow). It will break at Runtime if the passed workflow object is not of the right type.

## Properties

There are two sets of properties for this activity, those in the dialog box on the left, and those in the properties pane on the right.

The retrieve properties pane consists of the following sections:

* [Action](#action)
