The Mendix Cloud is our public cloud service and the default deployment option for Mendix applications.

Learn how to deploy your app, either in a Sandbox or to the Cloud. And go check out our AppCloudServices.

## Free App
Every App that you create from the Mendix Modeler or the Developer Portal, will always get a Free App with one environment in the Mendix Cloud. This environment is called a Sandbox. 

## Node
A Free App can be upgraded to a licensed App with a Node in the Mendix Cloud. A Node has several environments and is hosted on Mendix Cloud V3 or Mendix Cloud V4. 

## Environment
A Node has a minimum of two environments: production and acceptance. A test environment is a third optional environment. You can deploy your licensed app (that is linked to a node) to its environments.
