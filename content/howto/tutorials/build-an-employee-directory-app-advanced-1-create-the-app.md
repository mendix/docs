## 5 Welcome to the Web Modeler

Are you ready to develop your app using the Web Modeler? Let's go briefly through the interface, and we will go into detail later in this tutorial.

On the left side of the Web Modeler is the main menu. Via the icons in this menu, you can navigate to the following locations:

* **Pages** (for the UI)
* **Navigation Document** (for the menu)
* **Domain Models** (for the data structure)
* **Microflows** (for the business logic)
* **App Settings**
* **Theme Customizer**
* **Feedback**

You can click on the Mendix logo to go back to the **Developer Portal**.

The main window of the Web Modeler is where you’ll be developing the app by editing pages, microflows, and domain models.

On the right side of the Web Modeler you can find the toolbox and properties of elements you select in the editing area. The toolbox contains widgets, building blocks, or microflow activities that you can add to your app.
