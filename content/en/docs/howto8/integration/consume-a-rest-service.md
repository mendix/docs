## 1 Introduction

Mendix applications frequently need to communicate with existing systems. Whether you are creating an app to replace an older platform or a legacy system or want to integrate an existing database, the ability to integrate with existing systems is a necessary feature. In your Mendix app, you can use published REST services for this integration. 

This how-to shows you how to do this using an example in which you create an app that retrieves Wikipedia pages from a REST service. The resulting app is [available for download](/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/WikipediaApi.mpk).

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Integrate with an existing system using a REST service
* Call the REST service in a microflow

Creating a published REST service on top of the system you want to integrate with is outside the scope of this how-to; for instructions on how to do this, refer to the configuration of your non-Mendix Platform.

## 2 Creating a JSON Structure

If the system you want to integrate into your app has the functionality for exposing its data to REST services, you can integrate it easily into your Mendix app using consume REST service. Each system has a different JSON structure based on internal data models. 

You are going to use the Wikipedia REST service as an example in this how-to. It allows you to retrieve the summary of a Wikipedia page – in this case information about a country. This service can be reached at `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{title}`, where `{title}` is the title of a page.

We will start by providing to Studio Pro an example of what the REST service returns:

1. Open your browser and go to [https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Tahiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Tahiti).
2. This calls the REST service with a GET request – the result is the summary of the [Tahiti page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti) in the JSON format:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/get-call-result.png" alt="Screenshot of the result of the rest call" >}}

3. Copy the whole JSON snippet. Make sure that you select the **Raw Data** tab to copy the whole code structure.
4. Create a module and name it *RESTconsume*. To add a new [JSON structure](/refguide8/json-structures/) to your module with the sample JSON that you can use in the app, right-click the module in the **Project Explorer** and select **Add other** > **JSON structure**.
5. Enter a **Name** for the structure: *JSON_structure* and click **OK**.
6. In the **JSON Structure** dialog box, paste the JSON snippet in the **General** tab and click **Refresh**. This analyzes the structure of the JSON snippet that we can use later.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/json-structure.png" >}}

7. Click **OK**.

## 3 Creating an Import Mapping

An [import mapping](/refguide8/import-mappings/) specifies how the JSON relates to [entities](/refguide8/entities/). You can map the JSON to any entity you like. The following steps describe how to generate the entities and create an import mapping:

1. Right-click the module in the **Project Explorer** and select **Add other** > **Import Mapping**.
2. Enter a **Name** for the import mapping: *Import_mapping* and click **OK**.
3. In the **Select schema elements for import mapping** dialog box, click the radio button for **JSON structure** and then click **Select**.
4. Double-click **JSON_structure** in the **Select JSON Structure** dialog box.
5. Click **Expand all** and then click **Check all**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/import-mapping.png" >}}

6. Click **OK**. The **Import_mapping** document is displayed and the JSON structure is on the right.
7. Click **Map automatically** in the editor toolbar. 
8. A pop-up box is displayed informing you that can **See the details for the changes that have been applied**. You can click **Details** to see details of the mapping to the entities that are generated to match the JSON structure.
9. Click **Close** to see the entities corresponding to the JSON structure.

## 4 Adding an Input Entity to the Domain Model

The service takes the title of the page as an input and it returns the summary of the page from Wikipedia. 

In this section, you will create an entity that represents this input and associate it with its summary.

To add an input entity to the domain model, follow these steps:

1. In the **Project Explorer**, double-click the **Domain Model**.
2. Rename **Root** to **Summary**.
3. From the **Toolbox**, drag an **Entity** into the domain model.
4. Double-click the entity and enter *Input* for the **Name**.
5. For **Persistable**, select **No**.
6. On the **Attributes** tab, click **New** to add a string attribute and name it *Title*.
7. Click **OK**.
8. Drag an association from **Input** to **Summary**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/domain-model.png" >}}

9. Go to the **Import_mapping** and from the **Connector** pane drag **Input** as the input parameter for the input mapping.
10. Double-click **Summary**.
11. In the **Map entity 'Summary from the object element 'Summary** dialog box, **Set association** to **Yes** and select the **RESTconsume_input_Summary** for the **Association** to have the import mapping set the association:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/map-entity-from-input-mapping.png" >}}

12. Click **OK**. 

## 5 Calling the REST Service in a Microflow

You will now call the REST service in a [microflow](/refguide8/microflows/) to build the integration with Wikipedia. The microflow takes **Input** as the input parameter and sets the associated **Summary**.

To call the REST service in a microflow, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the module and select **Add** > **Microflow** and accept the default **Name** *Microflow* for the name of the microflow and click **OK**.
2. From the tool bar, drag a **Parameter** object to the microflow document.
3. Click **Select** for the **Data type** and select the **Input** entity as the input parameter. Click **OK**. 
4. Right-click the mouse and select **Insert** > **Activity** to insert an activity to the microflow. Double-click the activity and select the **Call REST service** to change the activity.
5. In the **Call REST** dialog box, click **Edit** for the **Location** and add the following to **Template**: `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{1}`, with the parameter being the Title attribute from the **Input** parameter `$Input/Title`. Click **OK**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/location.png" >}}

6. In the **Response** tab, the response has to be mapped using the import mapping. For **Response handling** select **Apply import mapping**.
7. For **Mapping**, click **Select** and double-click **Import_mapping**. For the **Parameter**, select **Input**. 
8. For **Output** select **Yes** for **Store in variable** and specify *Summary* for the **Variable name**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/response.png" >}}

9. Click **OK**.
10. Right-click after the **Call REST service** object and select **Insert** > **Activity** and double-click it and change it to a **Change object**.
11. For the **Input Object**, select **Input (RESTconsume.Input)**.
12. For **Refresh in client**, select **Yes**. This ensures that the summary is displayed on the screen.
13. Click **New**.
14. On the **Edit Change Item** dialog box, for **Member**, select **RESTconsume.Input_Summary (RESTconsume.Summary)**.
15. Under **Value**, enter `$Summary`.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/set-association.png" >}}

16. Click **OK**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/change-object.png" >}}

17. Click **OK**. You have created microflow that takes the title of an article as input and associates it with its summary.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/integration/consume-a-rest-service/microflow.png" >}}

You have successfully consumed a REST service and created a microflow to show the results. The rest of this how-to describes how to use this microflow in an app so that yoyu can see the REST call in action.

## 6 Creating a Page

To create a page for this app, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Homepage** and add a **Data view**.
2. Right-click the **[Unknown]** bar and click, **Select entity**. Select the **Input** entity.
3. For the **Data source – Type**, select **Microflow**.
4. For the **Name**, enter *CreateInput*. Note that when this page loads, it needs a new **Input** object – you will define the **CreateInput** microflow that creates this object in [Filling In the Create Input Microflow](#createinput).
5. Click **OK**.
6. From **Container widgets**, add a new **Table** with one row and two columns.
7. Drag the **Title** field onto the left column.
8. From the **Project Explorer**, drag **Microflow** into the right column.
9. Double-click the **Microflow** button and in the **Edit Action Button** dialog box, enter *Get summary* for the caption of the button.
10. Add a **Data view** below the table (inside the other data view).
11. From the **Connector**, drag the **Summary** entity onto the **[Unknown]** bar.
12. Click **OK**.
13. From this data view, delete all the fields except **Extract**.
14. Double-click **Extract**.
15. For **Show label**, select **No**.
16. Click **OK**.
17. Delete the **Save** and **Cancel** buttons.

## 7 Filling In the Create Input Microflow{#createinput}

Now all that is left is to have the **CreateInput** microflow create a new **Input** object.

To fill in the CreateInput microflow, follow these steps:

1. In the **Project Explorer**, double-click **CreateInput**. 
2. From the **Toolbox**, drag a **Create object** activity to the microflow.
3. Double-click the activity.
4. For **Entity**, click **Select** and double-click **Input**, then click **OK**.
5. Double-click the red **End event**.
6. Under **Return value**, enter `$NewInput`, then click **OK**

Congratulations! You can now start your app and get summaries from Wikipedia.
