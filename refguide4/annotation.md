An annotation is an element that can be used to put comments in a microflow.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

Currently you warn users of unpaid orders with a popup message in the client. Later you want to extend this warning with an e-mail message send to the user. To remember this you can use an annotation and put it beside the current activity that warns the user.
