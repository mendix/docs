## Introduction

The [Combo Box](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/219304) widget displays a list of options that users can select from. This is useful in scenarios where end-users need to filter their data through choices, such as being able to select or de-select different countries from a list.

A typical combo box can look like this:

The following sections will describe the different available widget properties and how to configure the widget using them.

### General Tab {#general}

The **Source** option (required) is used is used to configure the datasource type for the widget. It supports the following data types via these properties:

* [Context](#context)
* [Database](#database)
* [Static](#static)

##### Context {#context}

When Context source is selected, the **Data source** section (required) configures the type of the context. It supports the following data types via these properties:

* [Association](/refguide/association-source/)
* [Enumeration](/refguide/enumerations/)
* [Boolean](/refguide/boolean-expressions/)

##### Database List {#database}

The database source type can be used to set the value of a string or integer attribute with options fetched from an attribute with the same type.

##### Static Values {#static}

The static source type can be used to set the value of a string attribute with manually configured values.

#### General Tab

The **General** section allows you to configure general behavior and captions for the combo box. The following configurations are available:

* **Placeholder text** – captions that will be displayed when there is no data being selected
* **Filter type** – allows the user to type into the input and filter displayable options on the combo box
* **No options text** – captions that will be used when filter results are empty, or shown when there is no data displayed in the combo box's options
* **Clearable** – if enabled, this allows selected data to be cleared all at once
* **Custom content** – allows custom widgets to be displayed in the combo box instead of normal text values (only for association data source)
* **Show footer** – if enabled, this allows custom widgets to be placed in a combo box's footer (as shown below). For example, you can include a link, button, or image in the footer. A popular choice is including a "new item" button in the footer:

The **Multi selection (reference set)** section allows you to configure combo box behavior for reference set type datasource. The following configurations are available:

    * **Checkbox** – displays a checkbox on the left side of each option. Selected items will be marked by check marks.
    * **Row click** – each selected item will be filtered out from the displayed options. Items can deselected by clicking the {{% icon name="remove" %}} on each of the displayed selected items.
* **Show selected item as** – you can choose to display selected item as labels with {{% icon name="remove" %}} buttons which allow those items to be deselected (shown at the top of this screenshot), or as simple comma-separated text (shown at the bottom): 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/combobox/combobox-showselected.png" alt="Show selected item as list or labels examples" class="no-border" >}}
    {{% alert color="info" %}}The **Show selected item as** property is only available for the **Checkbox** selection method without custom content.{{% /alert %}}

* **Show Select All** – you can choose to enable a "Show select all" button that will be displayed on the top of the options list. It allows the end-user to click it and select or deselect all options at once:
