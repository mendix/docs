## Mendix 7 Compatibility

This is the first version that is also available for Mendix 7. Due to some incompatibilities between 6 and 7, there are now two packages available in the Mendix App Store:

* APM Module version {x.x.x}

  * This is the standard package, which is compatible with Mendix 7
  * This is available in the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/6127/Mendix/Mendix-Application-Performance-Monitor)
  
* APM Module version {x.x.x}
  * This is the same version packaged for Mendix 6
  * This is available in the **All Versions** tab of the App Store accessible via the Modeler

With the release of Mendix 7, the Mendix documentation changed, and the help links in APM pointed to the wrong location. This has been fixed.

## Bug fixes

* In the creation of a trigger in a measurement with a query as the source, the created trigger was connected to the parameter (or so it seemed in the UI). This has been fixed to work as expected.

* A range validation in the BaseTrigger entity that was on the TriggerContinuationPaused Boolean and should have been on TriggerContinuationDelay has been fixed.
