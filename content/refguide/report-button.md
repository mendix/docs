## 1 Introduction

You can set a [report grid](report-grid) to automatically generate the report when the page is loaded. However, if a report page has parameter widgets, you must also add a **Generate report button** widget so that the end-user can regenerate the report after specifying the parameter(s).

The reports are generated when the end-user clicks the generate report button.

## 2 Report Parameter Properties

An example of generate report button properties is represented in the image below:
