## 1 Introduction

The [Portfolio Management](https://portfolio.mendix.com) tool is available to all Mendix Cloud customers. It enables staying informed about initiatives and managing them in the different development stages. It provides portfolio managers, business stakeholders, and developers with everything they need to collaborate effectively in one place and bring new initiatives to the Mendix Platform.

To start the Portfolio Management app, go to the Developer Portal, open the [Switch to menu](/developerportal/), and select **Portfolio**.

## 2 Portfolio Landscape Overview {#portfolio-landscape}

When you start the Portfolio Management app for the first time, an introduction page opens. The introduction page describes the new features and gives helpful information. You can click **Visit Portfolio Management** to open the **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page. After that, when you start the Portfolio Management app, the **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page directly opens. You can click **Learn more about Portfolio Management** to go back to the introduction page.

### 2.1 My Portfolios vs Company Portfolios

The **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page contains two sections: **My Portfolios** and **Company Portfolios**. A section only appears if there is at least one [portfolio card](#portfolio-card) in that section.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/portfolio-landscape-overview.png" >}}

**My Portfolios** shows all the portfolios to which you have access. Clicking a portfolio card opens the portfolio.

**Company Portfolios** shows all the restricted portfolios in your company, to which you do not have access. Clicking a portfolio card shows more details about the portfolio. You can request access to a restricted portfolio by clicking **Request to Join** on the portfolio card. A Portfolio Manager needs to approve this [access request](#access-requests).

### 2.2 Portfolio Cards {#portfolio-card}

On the **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page, each portfolio is presented in a card. On a portfolio card, you can see the name of the portfolio, the company to which it belongs, the [privacy settings](#privacy-settings), and the avatars of Portfolio Managers (up to avatars of four Portfolio Managers).

#### 2.2.1 Different Privacy Settings of a Portfolio {#privacy-settings}

Currently, the privacy settings of a portfolio can be private or restricted. Their differences are shown in the table below:

| Portfolio type | Visible in the **Company Portfolios** section?               | How  to join the portfolio?                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Private        | {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/cross-mark.svg" >}} | A Portfolio Manager can [add users to the portfolio](#add-users). |
| Restricted     | {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/check-mark.svg" >}} | A Portfolio Manager can [add users to the portfolio](#add-users). Users can also request access by clicking **Request to Join** on the portfolio card. A Portfolio Manager needs to approve this [access request](#access-requests). |

A Portfolio Manager can change the **Privacy Settings** on the [Portfolio Settings](#portfolio-settings) page.

### 2.3 Opening a Portfolio 

When you click a portfolio card to which you have access, the portfolio opens with a menu on the left side. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/opened-portfolio.png" >}}

Clicking a menu item opens the corresponding page:

* [Initiatives Overview](#initiatives-overview)

## 3 Initiatives Overview {#initiatives-overview}

In the Portfolio Management app, the term "Initiative" represents a business objective or strategic goal, and could span across multiple apps. An initiative can be related to multiple apps or just one small part of a big app. For progress tracking, we recommend you to break down an app into smaller initiatives whenever possible.

The **Initiatives Overview** page gives an overview of all the initiatives in this portfolio.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/initiatives-overview.png" >}}

In the search box, you can search for an initiative by the initiative name.

### 5.1 Adding New Users {#add-users}

{{% alert color="info" %}}Only [Portfolio Managers](#access-management) can add new users.{{% /alert %}}

1. Go to **Access Management**.
2. On the upper-right corner, click **Add Users**.
3. In the dialog box, enter the **Email Address** of the user who you want to invite. You can add multiple email addresses if you need to invite more than one user. The users can be people within your company or outside your company. For users outside your company, their names and profile pictures are not displayed.
4. Select an **Access Role** for the user(s) – **Portfolio Manager**, **Contributor**, or **Viewer**. This determines the user's access level to all the initiatives in this portfolio.
5. Click **Add to List**.
6. Click **Send Invites**.

The users that you invited receive a notification per email and now appear on the **Access Management** page. 

For users outside your company, they need to accept their invitation. Once they accept, their **Status** will change from **Pending** to **Active**. 

For users within your company, if they have a Mendix account, their **Status** will be **Active** immediately; and if they do not have an Mendix account, their **Status** will change from **Pending** to **Active** after they create a Mendix account.

### 5.2 Editing and Removing a User

At the end of the row, click the ellipsis button (**...**), and then select the corresponding action. To update the permissions and the role of a user, click **Edit**. To remove a user from the portfolio, click **Remove**.

### 5.3 Access Requests {#access-requests}

Users from the same company can request access to a restricted portfolio from the [Portfolio Landscape Overview](#portfolio-landscape) by clicking **Request to Join** on the portfolio card. Access requests need to be approved by a Portfolio Manager. Portfolio Managers automatically get a [notification](/developerportal/#notifications) for a new access request. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/access-requests.png" >}}

The **Access Requests** page shows all open access requests for the portfolio with the following items:

* **Requested By** – This is the name and avatar of the user who requested access.
* **Role** – This is the access role that was requested by the user.
* **Date** – This is the date when the request was made.
* **Reject** – Clicking this rejects the request.
* **Approve** – Clicking this approves the request and gives the user access to the portfolio.
