The template grid shows a list of objects in a tile view. For example, a template grid can show a list of products. Using controls provided by the template grid you can browse, search and manipulate those objects. The template grid has a lot in common with the data grid. The main difference is that the objects are shown in templates (a sort of small data view) instead of rows.

## Common properties

### Name

The internal name of the widget. You can use this to give sensible names to widgets. The name property also appears in the generated HTML: the widget DOM element automatically includes the class '`mx-name-{NAME}`', which can be useful for [Selenium testing](/howto50/Selenium+Support).

### Class

The class property allows you to specify a cascading style sheet (CSS) class for the widget. This class will be applied to the widget in the browser and the widget will get the corresponding styling. The class should be a class from the theme that is used in the project. It overrules the default styling of the widget.

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

Note that the styling is applied in the following order:

1.  Default styling defined by the theme the project uses.
2.  The 'Class' property of the widget.
3.  The 'Style' property of the widget.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Style

The style property allows you to specify additional CSS styling. If a class is also specified, this styling is applied _after_ the class.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

background-color:blue;
This will result in a blue background

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Tab index

The tab index influences the order in which the end user navigates through the page using the tab key. By default tab indices are zero and the tab order is determined automatically by the client system. A value of minus one (-1) means that the widget will be skipped when tabbing through the page.

_Default value:_ 0

## Components

### Control bar

See [Control Bar](Control+Bar).

### Search bar (for data source type "Database")

See [Search Bar](Search+Bar).

### Sort bar (for data source type "Database")

See [Sort Bar](Sort+Bar).

## General properties

### Show control bar

This property indicates whether the control bar will be visible in the end user interface. The control bar also includes the paging buttons.

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

Even if the control bar is invisible there can still be a default button that is triggered by (double) clicking a row. See the property 'Default button trigger' and [grid buttons](Control+Bar) for more information.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

_Default value:_ True

### Show paging buttons

This property indicates with the buttons to page through the information in the grid are visible. Only hide these buttons if you are sure that there will never be more objects than the number of rows of the grid. Note that hiding the control bar also hides the paging buttons.

_Default value:_ True

### Number of rows

With this property you can change the number of rows of templates that will be shown on one page.

_Default value:_ 3

### Number of columns

With this property you can change the number of templates that will be shown next to each other in one row.

_Default value:_ 2

### Style template

The style template property allows you to choose from three different styling of the template grid. These stylings depend on your theme package.

### Selection mode

The selection mode determines whether and how the user can select items in the grid.

<table><thead><tr><th class="confluenceTh">Value</th><th class="confluenceTh">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd">No selection</td><td class="confluenceTd">The user cannot select items.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Single selection</td><td class="confluenceTd">The user can select a single item by clicking on it. Clicking another item will make that item the selection.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Multi-selection</td><td class="confluenceTd">The user can select multiple items by clicking the first one and holding the 'Ctrl' key while clicking on other items. Simply clicking an item will deselect all items and make the clicked item the selection.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Simple multi-selection</td><td class="confluenceTd">The user can select multiple items by simply clicking on them.</td></tr></tbody></table>

_Default value:_ Single selection

### Select first

This property indicates whether the first item will be selected initially. This is especially useful if there is a data view listening to this grid.

_Default value:_ False

### Default button trigger

The default button can be triggered by a single or a double click on a row.

<table><thead><tr><th class="confluenceTh">Value</th><th class="confluenceTh">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Single click</td><td class="confluenceTd">A single click triggers the default button. This cannot be used in combination with allowing the user to select rows.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Double click</td><td class="confluenceTd">A double click triggers the default button.</td></tr></tbody></table>

_Default value:_ Double click

### Refresh time (in seconds)

If the refresh time is non-zero, the template grid will refresh its contents every given number of seconds. For example, a task list could be refreshed every minute so that you know when new tasks arrive. By default the refresh time is zero and this means that the grid will not automatically refresh itself.

_Default value:_ 0

## Data source properties

The data source determines which objects will be shown in the template grid. For general information about data sources, see [Data Sources](Data+Sources).

### Type

The template grid supports the following types of data sources: Database Source, Association Source, Microflow Source. The database source retrieves objects from the database and supports searching and sorting. The association source follows an association from the enclosing data view to get to the objects. Finally, the microflow source calculates the list of objects by executing a microflow.

### Entity (Path) (for data source types "Database" and "Association")

The entity (path) property specifies of which entity instances will be shown in the grid. A top-level grid is always connected to an entity. A nested grid can either be connected to an entity or to an entity path starting in the entity of the containing data view.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

Let us say the domain model contains entities Order and OrderLine with a reference from OrderLine to Order. You can then create a data view on Order and inside it a grid on OrderLine that is connected to the entity path OrderLine_Order/OrderLine. This will ensure that the grid will only show order lines of the order in the data view.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Show search bar (for data source type "Database")

See [Database source](Database+Source).

### Wait for search (for data source type "Database")

See [Database Source](Database+Source).

### XPath constraint (for data source type "Database")

See [Database Source](Database+Source).

### Apply context (for data source type "Database")

See [Database Source](Database+Source).

### Remove from context (for data source type "Database")

See [Database Source](Database+Source).

### Microflow (for data source type "Microflow")

The microflow property specifies a microflow is executed when the grid is opened. The microflow returns the objects that will be shown in the grid.

### Microflow settings (for data source type "Microflow")

The microflow settings specify which parameters to pass to the microflow. See [Starting Microflows](Starting+Microflows).

## Visibility properties

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}
Conditional visibility settings were added in version 5.10.0.
{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Visible

By default, whether or not an element is displayed in the browser is determined by how the page is designed and the user's roles within the application. However, the page can be configured to hide the element unless a certain condition is met.Â 

## Attribute Condition

### Attribute

When checked, this setting hides the widget unless a particular attribute has a certain value. Only boolean and enumeration attributes can be assigned to this purpose.

A practical example would be a web shop in which the user must submit both billing and delivery information. In this case you might not wish to bother the user with a second set of address input fields unless he or she indicates that the billing and delivery address are not the same. You can accomplish this by making the delivery address fields conditionally visible based on the boolean attribute SameBillingAndDeliveryAddress.

### Module roles

The widget can be made visible to a subset of the user roles available in your application. When activated, this setting will render the widget invisible to all users that are not linked to one of the selected user roles. Please note that this does not override project security. Any restrictions due to microflow, form, or entity access will remain in effect.
