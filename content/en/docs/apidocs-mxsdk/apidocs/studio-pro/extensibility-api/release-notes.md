These release notes cover changes to the Extensibility API.

## Version 10.15.1

* We reverted a breaking change in the `IWebView.PostMessage` API where the JSON serialization defaults changed, resulting in incompatible JSON arriving at the web side.

## Version 10.15.0

* We introduced the Untyped Model Access API. For more details and practical examples, see [How to Use the Untyped Model Access API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/extensibility-api/extensibility-api-howtos/untyped-model-access-api/).
* We added `CurrentLanguage` to `IConfiguration` to provide which language is currently set for the UI of Studio Pro.
  
## Version 10.14.0

* We added the event `ActiveDocumentChanged`, which allows an extension to be notified when the active document changes in Studio Pro. If the document is not yet supported by the Extensibility API, only its name and type will be returned.
* We added support for several microflow activities for lists and objects.
* We introduced `IMicroflowActivitiesService`, which includes several functions to facilitate the creation of these new activities.
