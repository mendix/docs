Webhooks for stories and Sprints allow you to build or set up Mendix Platform connectors that subscribe to certain events on the Developer Portal. When one of those events is triggered, Mendix sends an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks for stories and Sprints can be used to update an external application to keep it up-to-date with the changes happening in the Developer Portal.

Every POST payload contains the following delivery information as part of the header:

* `MxAPI-Projects-EventCategory` – the types of event subscribed to (for example, Sprints)
* `MxAPI-Projects-Delivery` – a random UUID
* `MxAPI-Signature` –  the HMAC hex digest (asymmetric hash using the *HMAC_SHA256* hash algorithm) of the response body, which is calculated using the hash (the hashes secret provided in the webhooks setting using the *SHA-256* hash algorithm with the length as 50)
    * For example, `(gNh407kBD1wkpHfwIrjWcTMjw4rKxIKX0s5b48FYOys=)`
* `MxAPI-Webhooks-Version` – the version of the webhooks for stories and Sprints payload (for example, 1)
* `MxAPI-Webhooks-Version-Expiry` – the expiry date for this version (empty if it is the latest version)
* `User-Agent` – `Mx-Platform`
