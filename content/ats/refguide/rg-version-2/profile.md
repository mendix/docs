To change your _Full name_ type into the text box. The change is automatically saved. The _Full name _ is displayed in various places in the app, e.g. in the test run history. This is not the user name which is used to log in.

In order to change your password you have to be able to log in first. If you have problems logging in, contact your tenant administrator.
