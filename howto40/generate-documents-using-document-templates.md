## Description

Make sure that the object which is connected to the document template you intend to use is passed to the microflow.

 **Use a 'Create object' activity to create a new object of the System.FileDocument entity or a specialization of it. If you do not know how to use the 'Create object' activity, please refer to** **[this](create-and-change-an-object)** **article.**

This object will be used to store the document in.

 **Add a 'Generate document' activity to the microflow and double-click on it.**

You can choose either the language of the current user, the default project language, or a language stored in a variable.

 **Use the drop-down at 'Document type' to select which of the available formats should be used for the generated document.**

 **To enable viewing of the generated document, add a download form with file manager, or add a 'Download' activity to the microflow that generated the document.**

If the document is not intended to be kept after the initial download, you can add a 'Change' activity to the microflow that generated the document to set the 'DeleteAfterDownload' flag of the document to 'true'.
