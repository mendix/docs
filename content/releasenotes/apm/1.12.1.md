## 1.12.0

This release is identical to the [1.11.1](1.11.1) release, but it is for Mendix 7.0.2 and above.

### Other Fixes

* When defining an action 'Create trap message' in the trigger configuration. The trap was not created and linked to the triggered event. Both issues are fixed.
* If the logtool is used there is protection in place to configure the 'Max messages to store'. By default this is set to 100.000 records. This protection is in place to protect from overloading the database with records. There is also a protection 'Fallback level' in place. When the logtool is noticing issues like to much data is processed in the logtool the 'Fallback level' will be set the logging to INFO for all loglevels. In exceptional cases the application generates too much INFO logging. This behaviour will consume heap memory and in the end the application will run out of memory. In this release this behaviour still consumes heap memory, however there is a fix in place to prevent the application from running out of heap memory. The following fix in the Mendix platform version 7.7.1 is also needed: We improved the memory management of persistent entities that have been committed to the persistent storage.
