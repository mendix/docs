## Removed features

*   The timeline in the Planning section has been removed.
*   Chat functionality has been discontinued in the Platform Portal. As we have to prioritize features carefully in order to deliver the best software we can, we've come to realize that Mendix users don't use the chat functionality very often. In order to focus our time on more heavily used existing or exciting new features, we've decided to discontinue this functionality.
