## 1 Introduction

This document describes the role of the Technical Contact within the Mendix Cloud.

The Technical Contact is responsible for license renewal and is the first point of contact for the Mendix Support department. A Mendix application will always be set up and delivered with a technical contact assigned to it. The Technical Contact needs an *MxID* before Mendix can activate a license for an application.

It is currently not possible to select more than one Technical Contact in the Mendix Cloud (for more information, see [How to Change the Technical Contact](/developerportal/howto/change-roles). For on-premises installations, it is possible to select more than one contact. Contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com) with your request.

## 2 Technical Contact Responsibilities

The responsibilities depend on the type of hosting for your app: on-premises or in the Mendix Cloud.

### 2.1 On-Premises

This means that the Mendix app is running on the customer's own infrastructure.

These are some details about managing licenses (renewals, activation, and upgrades):

* Mendix will send license renewal notifications to the Technical Contact via email
* If the Technical Contact would like to expand the license (for example, for more users), they need to contact their Account Executive

You can submit requests in the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes, and incidents.

### 2.2 Mendix Cloud

For apps in the Mendix Cloud, the Technical Contact is the first point of contact for the app:

* The Technical Contact will receive notifications for upcoming maintenance operations on the application
* The Technical Contact will be able to receive alerts from the Mendix application when problems arise (for example, CPU load is high, running out of disk space)
* The Technical Contact can configure the alert settings in the **Monitoring** tab of the cloud node

The Technical Contact can perform all the regular operations on the Mendix Cloud node in the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com). Additionally, you can manage the access rights of your team members so that they can deploy, stop, start, etc. For more information, see [Security - Node Permissions](/developerportal/settings/node-permissions).

These are some details about managing licenses (renewals, activation, and upgrades):

* Mendix is responsible for Mendix Cloud app renewals
* Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) if you want to expand the license

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes, and incidents.
