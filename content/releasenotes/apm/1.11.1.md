## 1.11.1

This is a release with bug fixes. It is for Mendix 6.2 and above.

### Other Fixes and Improvements

* When defining a **Create trap message** action in the trigger configuration, the trap was not created and linked to the triggered event. Both issues are fixed.
* Creating sample data failed, because the **Frequency** attribute was set to empty and, in Mendix 6.8.1, the validation rules behave differently. **Frequency** always gets a value now.
