These step-by-step guides teach you how to build native mobile applications and more. Many of these guides use the Mendix Native Mobile Builder UI tool included in Mendix Studio Pro v8.15 and above:

* [Build a Mendix Native App Locally](/refguide/mobile/distributing-mobile-apps/building-native-apps/native-build-locally/) – Follow this guide to build your apps locally using the Mendix Native Mobile Builder.
* [Build a Mendix Native App Locally Manually](/refguide/mobile/distributing-mobile-apps/building-native-apps/native-build-locally-manually/) – Follow this guide to build your apps locally and without an internet connection.
* [Build a Mendix Native App in the Cloud](/refguide/mobile/distributing-mobile-apps/building-native-apps/deploying-native-app/) – Go from a blank slate to an app running on a device.
* [Create a Custom Developer App](/refguide/mobile/distributing-mobile-apps/building-native-apps/how-to-devapps/) – Create a custom developer app (a substitute for the Make It Native app) which accommodates custom dependencies such as native widgets or fonts.
* [Native Template](/refguide/mobile/distributing-mobile-apps/building-native-apps/native-template/) –  The Native Template describes the native dependencies your app needs, and it includes two native apps (one for iOS and one for Android) that can be independently built to create the finished apps.
