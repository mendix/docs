[Hybrid apps](/refguide8/developing-hybrid-mobile-apps/) are built in either connected or [offline](/refguide8/offline-first/) mode. This allows you to maintain two mobile device profiles: one for users who are always online, and one for users with intermittent connectivity. The Mendix Portal builds connected apps by default. Configuring a hybrid app to run in offline-enabled mode can be done in the Mendix Portal in the [Mobile App](/developerportal/deploy/mobileapp/) section by checking the **Enable offline capabilities?** setting.
