## 1 Introduction 

The **Pages** category contains Studio how-to's on pages and will help you build pages for various use cases, such as configuring a list and view its details, enabling your end-user to attach images, or building a form. 

For more general guidelines on how to create a page, drag and drop elements on it, see [Pages](/studio/page-editor) in the *Studio 8 Guide*.
