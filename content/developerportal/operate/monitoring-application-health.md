## 1 Introduction

When your application has reached production status, it's important to keep track of its status and health. When you click **Alerts** in the **Operate** category of the **Developer Portal**, you can inspect your application's health in the Mendix Cloud. 

Mendix analyzes the application and platform status periodically. All status alerts are logged in the **History** of the **Alerts**. 
If you [Receive Environment Status Alerts](/developerportal/howto/receive-alerts), you will receive a status alert only once. Mendix will not send you multiple alerts of the same status.

This document will explain how to access the application status page, what the information on this page means, and how to look at the alerts for your app.

## 2 Application Status

The Mendix Cloud automatically monitors the health and status of apps that are deployed on cloud nodes. To access the information gathered in this way, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the [Developer Portal](https://home.mendix.com).
2.  Open the app that you want to monitor.
3.  Click **Alerts** under the **Operate** category. This will display the status of your app node in various categories.

  {{% alert type="warning" %}}

  The Acceptance and Production buttons at the top let you switch between viewing the status for your production and acceptance node. Note that accessing production information may require additional authentication and is subject to your project's security settings.

  {{% /alert %}}

4.  If one of the status items is not listed as **OK**, click the line to show an additional information box with details about the error.

This status information will tell you important information that you either need in order to resolve the issue, or that needs to be included when submitting a support request with [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com). You can download a log of the alerts on the **Log** page under the **Operate** category.

Any status that could cause your app to stop functioning will result in an alert. For example, the monitoring information from the image showes that one of the status indicators was *Critical*. When this happens to one of your nodes, all users that are subscribed to alerts will receive an email alert.

## 3 Alerting Categories and Thresholds

There are a number of categories on the status overview that are related to various technical parts of your application environment. Any category that does not display as *OK* needs to be investigated. Each category indicates a different part of the app infrastructure that is monitored.

### 3.1 Application Status

CPU | |
:---|:---|
Description | Overall system load of the application server. High values indicate high CPU load because of application activity, and/or the CPU is spending too much time waiting for disk reads or writes.
Example message | System load: CRITICAL (9.6, 10.19, 10.84)
Warning Threshold | System load is higher than 2.8 over the last 15, 10, and 5 minutes, with a maximum deviation of 20% between the values.
Critical Threshold | System load is higher than 6.0 over the last 15, 10 and 5 minutes, with a maximum deviation of 20% between the values.
First actions to take | Inspect the trends for *Application node CPU usage* combined with *Application node disk throughput* and *Application node load* for anomalies and correlate those with application behavior.

Critical Logs | |
:---|:---|
Description | The *CRITICAL* log level is reserved for issuing messages in *rare cases where the application may not be able to function reliably anymore*, for example, there's a chance of data corruption when the application continues to be running. Internal JVM Errors are logged to this level. Out of Memory errors, which are JVM Errors must be treated as harmful for the stability and integrity of your mendix application process.
Example message | 2 critical error(s) were logged
Warning Threshold | Not used.
Critical Threshold | If any logging is done on CRITICAL level, the alerts status always directly switches to Critical. The critical log messages counter will only be reset when restarting the application process.
First actions to take | Inspect the application log file and look up the CRITICAL error messages. Restart the application as soon as possible in case of stability issues.

Health Microflow | |
:---|:---|
Description | A health check microflow was implemented in the application model, but it detected a warning that needs to be reported, and returns this warning as string value when the microflow finishes. |
Example message | Health: the nightly import job took more than an hour to complete! |
Warning Threshold | The warning status is triggered as long as the defined health check microflow returns a non-empty string.
Critical Threshold | Not used.
First actions to take | Because a health check is completely defined by customizable application logic, this can vary wildly.

Running | |
:---|:---|
Description | Show the state (running, not running) of the application, or an error state when the process should be running, but is not responding or otherwise inaccessible.
Example message | Application should be running, but the application process has disappeared!
Warning Threshold | Not used.
Critical Threshold | If the application process should be running but completely disappeared, or if the JVM process does not respond to any signal any more.
First actions to take | Review the application state for Out Of Memory errors and/or review OS memory trends for a OS-level memory problem. If unavailable, restart the application.

### 3.2 Platform Status

Application Server Up | |
:---|:---|
Description | The container or virtual machine in which the application process is running is reachable over the internal network. Alerts on this subject might point at an internal network connectivity issue.
Example message | Packet loss = 5%, RTA = 226.74 ms.
Warning Threshold | Response on a series of ICMP ping packets arrives with more than 5% packet loss, or with a latency higher than 200 milliseconds.
Critical Threshold | Response on a series of ICMP ping packets arrives with more than 50% packet loss, or with a latency higher than 1 second.
First actions to take | If this alert triggers and the application seems to be slow to respond, or if you're getting the red error page with running monsters, visit https://status.mendix.com/ to see if there is an outage. Inspect trends graphs to look for any anomaly in application behaviour leading up to the problem. If no outage is reported, contact Mendix Support, there might be something wrong with this specific environment.

Database Server Up | |
:---|:---|
Description | The operating system of the database server used by the application is reachable over the internal network. Alerts on this subject might point at an internal network connectivity issue.
Example message | Packet loss = 5%, RTA = 226.74 ms.
Warning Threshold | Response on a series of ICMP ping packets arrives with more than 5% packet loss, or with a latency higher than 200 milliseconds.
Critical Threshold | Response on a series of ICMP ping packets arrives with more than 50% packet loss, or with a latency higher than 1 second.
First actions to take | If this alert triggers and the application log displays errors about not being able to create database connections, visit https://status.mendix.com/ to see if there is an outage. Inspect trends graphs to look for any anomaly in application behaviour leading up to the problem. If no outage is reported, contact Mendix Support, there might be something wrong with this specific environment.

Application Server Disk Usage | |
:---|:---|
Description | Track the amount of disk space used for storage of the application model, application log files and uploaded files owned by the application.
Example message | Disk usage 83% (warning=80, critical=90).
Warning Threshold | More than 80% of available disk space is in use.
Critical Threshold | More than 90% of available disk space is in use.
First actions to take | Review trends for *Application node disk usage in %* and *Application node disk usage (in bytes)* and inspect the usage value of the application files partition (usually /srv/) to see if there is a sudden increase or a slow increase over time. Resolve by either stopping a runaway process, removing old files, or ordering more storage.

Database Server Disk Usage | |
:---|:---|
Description | Track the amount of disk space used for the database belonging to the appication.
Example message | Disk usage 92% (warning=80, critical=90).
Warning Threshold | More than 80% of available disk space is in use.
Critical Threshold | More than 90% of available disk space is in use.
First actions to take | Review trends for *Database node disk usage in %* and *Database node disk usage (in bytes)* and inspect the usage value of the database partition (usually /var/lib/postgresql/) to see if there is a sudden increase or a slow increase over time. Resolve by either stopping a runaway process, removing old data, or ordering more storage.

Web Server | |
:---|:---|
Description | The application URL is reachable. This check tries to visit the URL of your application, retrieving HTTP headers on the top level location /.
Example message | Did not find correct headers for url `https://example.mendixcloud.com/`
Warning Threshold | The application URL is not reachable.
Critical Threshold | Not used.
First actions to take | If this alert triggers, and visiting the application url results in slow loading or unresponsiveness, visit [https://status.mendix.com/](https://status.mendix.com/) to see if there is an outage. This condition might point to an internal networking connectivity problem.

## 4 Alerts History

To access the history of the alerts from your app, follow these steps:

1.  Click the tab **History** on the **Alerts** page.

2. You will see an overview of all alerts that have been sent for this application.

    ![](attachments/alerts-history.png)

    The overview shows alert types and details including date and time. The alert types provide a broad indication of the type of error that occurred, such as critical log messages or failures of the health check microflow. Recovery notifications will also be shown here.

    The Acceptance and Production buttons at the top let you switch between viewing the status for your production and acceptance node. Note that accessing production information may require additional authentication and is subject to your project's security settings.

3. Click **Details**. This will open the alert details, which contains additional information. More information might be available in your application's log file.
