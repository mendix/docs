This empowers the Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master, or the development team to craft surveys with personalized customizations, including survey goals, duration, and questionnaire types. After configuring the survey, end-users can conveniently submit their responses. Subsequently, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, or the team can analyze the survey results, extracting valuable insights."

## Introduction

Mini Surveys is a part of Mendix App Insights, a set of tools designed to help you gather and consolidate feedback from your customers.

The Mini Surveys feature consists of two parts:

* A pop-up survey in your app for users to fill in
* A back-end dashboard in the [navigation pane](/developerportal/#navigation-pane) of **Apps** for you to create surveys and aggregate your survey results.
You begin by creating a mini survey from the **Mini Survey** page in the navigation pane of **Apps**, and then you implement the mini survey by configuring the [Mendix Mini Surveys](/appstore/modules/mendix-mini-surveys/) module in Studio Pro. After the mini survey has started, you can view responses that have been collected in Mini Surveys in the Mendix Portal and export the responses to an XLSX file.

This document first describes all the pages in Mini Surveys in **Apps**, and then it describes the procedure for running a mini survey.

## Mendix Mini Survey Configuration 

### Survey Overview {#survey-overview}

When you click **Mini Surveys** in the [navigation pane](/developerportal/#navigation-pane) for an app that already has existing mini surveys, the **Survey Overview** page opens first.

On the upper-left corner of the page, you can see the name of the app currently opened. Click the app name to open a drop-down list of other apps you can navigate to that have been previously opened for Mini Surveys.

The tabs of the **Survey Overview** page are described below.

#### Active Tab {#active}

The **Active** tab shows all the mini surveys that are active for the app with the following details:

* **ID** – This is the unique ID of the mini survey. You can also find this ID on the [survey details](#survey-details) page of the mini survey.
* **Name** – This is the name of the mini survey.
* **Location** – The Location is an identifier that refers to the location where the mini survey will appear in your app.

##### Statuses of Mini Surveys {#survey-status}

A mini survey can have different statuses. You can check the status of a mini survey on the [Active](#active) tab.

Along its lifecycle, a mini survey can have the following statuses:

* **Draft** – This status means the mini survey is not finalized. You can still edit the survey and when you finalize it, you need to schedule it. Once you schedule a survey, its status changes to **Scheduled**.
* **Scheduled** – This status means the mini survey is finalized, but its start time is not reached yet. Once the start time is reached, its status changes to **Active**.
* **Active** – This status indicates that the mini survey is currently running. After the survey reaches its end time, the status will change to **Finished**.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}Only one survey can be active per survey location at a given time.{{% /alert %}}

* **Finished** – This status means the mini survey has ended.

{{% alert color="info" %}}When a mini survey has the status of **Draft**, you can still edit everything in the survey. When a mini survey has the status of **Scheduled**, **Active**, or **Finished**, you can only edit the **Settings** section (for **Runtime** and **Toaster Placement**) in the survey.{{% /alert %}}

#### Archived Tab {#archived}

The **Archived** tab shows all the mini surveys that you are archived for the app. 

The list on this tab contains the following information:

Clicking the mini survey in a row on the list shows its [survey details](#survey-details) page.

#### Settings Tab {#settings}

On the **Settings** tab of **Survey Overview**, you can view or generate API keys.

* **API Keys** – You can view API keys here, or generate an API key if there is none available. You need to use the API key as input when you configure the Mendix Mini Surveys module in Studio Pro to implement the mini survey. You need only one API key per app.

    * To generate an API key, click **Generate API Key** here.

### Survey Details {#survey-details}

When you click a mini survey on the [Survey Overview](#survey-overview) page, the survey details page of the mini survey opens.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/app-insights/mini-surveys/survey-details.png" >}}

On the upper-right corner, you can find the following buttons:

* **Share Link** – Clicking **Share Link** copies the link to this page, which allows you to share the survey details with others.

On this tab, you can view all the responses that have been collected for the mini survey.

## Running a Mini Survey

### Creating a Mini Survey {#create-survey}

1. Open the app in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/) and click **Mini Surveys** in the sidebar. What you see depends on whether there are existing mini surveys for the app:

   * If there are existing mini surveys for the app, [Survey Overview](#survey-overview) opens, which lists all the existing mini surveys and shows the **Create New Survey** button
   * If there are no existing mini surveys for this app, you only see the **Create New Survey** button

2. Click **Create New Survey** to start the survey wizard.
3. Enter the following information for your mini survey:

    * **Context**
        * **Survey Title** – Give the mini survey a name.
        * **Description** – Descirbe your survey.
        * **Start date & End date** – Set the start and end time of the mini survey.
        * **Survey Location** – Select the location of the survey widget.
    * **Questions** – You can set up to three questions per mini survey.
        * **Open Question** – Create a question where the user can fill in their own answer.
        * **Score** – Create a question where a user can give a star or emoji rating.
        * **Multiple Choice** – Create a question where you can set up to 4 answers for the user to pick from.
        * **NPS** – Let the user pick a score between 0 and 10 to rate your app.
    * **Finalize** – Shows an summary of your survey.
        * **Toaster Placement** – Set on which corner of the page the mini survey appears.

4. Click **Preview** to see how the mini survey looks once it is live.
5. If the preview looks good, click **Schedule Survey** to complete the creation of the survey.

Now you can [implement the mini survey](#implement-survey).

### Editing a Mini Survey {#edit-survey}

To edit a mini survey, perform the following steps:

1. Open the app in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/).
2. Click **Mini Surveys** in the sidebar. The [Survey Overview](#survey-overview) page opens.
3. On the **Active** tab, click the mini survey that you want to edit. The [survey details](#survey-details) page opens.

     * **Finished** – if both the start and end dates are in the past

### Implementing a Mini Survey {#implement-survey}

Before the start time of the mini survey is reached, you should implement the survey in Studio Pro. Otherwise, users will not actually receive the mini survey, even if it has the [Status](#survey-status) of **Active** on the **Survey Overview** page. You can [reset the start time in the Settings section](#edit-survey) if you need more time to implement the survey in Studio Pro.

#### Obtaining an API Key {#obtain-api-key}

To obtain an API key for the implementation, follow these steps:

1. On the [Survey Overview](#survey-overview) page.
2. Go to the [Setting](#settings) tab.
3. Check the **API Keys** section:
    * If there is already an active API key, it is shown on the table. If it is suitable to use, click **Copy** to copy the API key, and save it for later use.
    * If there is no active API key that you can use, generate one as follows:

        1. Click **Generate API Key**.
        2. In the **Confirmation dialog** box, click **Proceed**. The **Generated Token** pop-up window opens and shows the new API key.

### Survey Opt-out Rules

A user can choose to opt out of a survey. Once opted out, the survey will no longer appear for that user, even if they have not completed it. This occurs when a user dismisses the survey without submitting it.

* The first time a user dismisses the survey, it will reappear the next time they visit the page. Any information they entered will be saved and shown when they see the survey again.
* If the user dismisses the survey a second time, it will no longer appear for them, even if they trigger it again.

Survey opt-out rule is a variable cached to your internet browser. You can reset and show a survey multiple times by clearing your browser cache.

{{% alert color="info" %}}In a future release, we will allow you to customize these opt-out rules from the App Insights portal.{{% /alert %}} 

### Unfinished Surveys

If a user only answers one or two questions before they close the mini survey. The answers will be stored in your app. Every 15 minutes a scheduled event will submit all unfinished surveys collected in your app to the **Mini Surveys** in **Apps**. A survey answer must be more than one hour old before it is submitted by the scheduled event.
