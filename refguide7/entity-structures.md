## General

Use an entity structure document to specify how an entity gets converted into JSON. You can use entity structures in [import](import-mappings) and [export mappings](export-mappings).

### Entity

Select an entity that you would like to convert into JSON.

The tree structure shows the selected entity and its attributes, with the following columns:

* _Name_. The name if the attribute, and _(Object)_ for the root entity.
* _Primitive Type_. Shows the type of the element.

## Documentation

Use the documentation field to describe the entity structure.
