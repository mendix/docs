A text box can be used to display and/or edit a textual value.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

This text box allows the end-user to set the name of the customer.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

A text box must be placed in a table cell within a data view or template grid and connected to an attribute of type String. The connected attribute is shown in blue and between brackets inside the text box.

## General Properties

### Decimal precision (only in web forms, only for numeric attributes)

The precision of a value describes the number of digits that are used to express that value. This property indicates the number of decimal places (the number of digits following the point).

_Default value:_ 2

### Group digits (only in web forms, only for numeric attributes)

For ease of reading, numbers with many digits before the decimal separator may be divided into groups using a delimiter. This property indicates whether the end user will see these groups.

_Default value:_ False

### Show as password (only for attributes of type String or HashString)

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| False

 |
| True
 | Typed characters are not shown to the end user. Instead an asterisk is shown for every typed character.

### Placeholder text (only in mobile forms)

The placeholder text is shown when no text has been entered yet. It can be used to give a hint to the user what kind of text should be entered.

### Maximum length

The input mask limits what the user can enter in the text box. A '9' means any digit, 'Z' means any letter, 'U' an upper-case letter, 'L' a lower-case letter and '*' a letter or a digit. Other characters will be taken literally. For example, the input mask 99-LLL-9999 matches 24-apr-2008.
