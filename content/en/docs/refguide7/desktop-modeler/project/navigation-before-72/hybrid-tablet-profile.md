{{% alert color="warning" %}}

For details on how this works in Mendix versions 7.2 and 7.3, see [Navigation in 7.2 and 7.3](/refguide7/navigation-in-72-and-73/). For Mendix version 7.4 and above, see [Navigation](/refguide7/navigation/).

{{% /alert %}}

When the hybrid tablet profile is enabled, every user that accesses the Mendix application from a PhoneGap hybrid application running on a tablet device will automatically be redirected to this profile. If the hybrid tablet profile is disabled, tablet users will be redirected to the [hybrid phone profile](/refguide7/hybrid-phone-profile/). If the hybrid phone profile is disabled, users will be redirected to the [desktop profile](/refguide7/desktop-profile/).
