## 1 Introduction

The [Navigation Layout](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/23446/) module includes the the layouts that are used in all app pages. Layouts specify what comes where, and each page is based on a layout. A layout contains widgets and structures that return on every page based on that layout. For example, it is common to put a menu bar widget in a layout so that the menu is visible on all pages.
