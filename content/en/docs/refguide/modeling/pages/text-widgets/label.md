## 1 Introduction

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

For input elements, it is recommended to use the [label property](/refguide/text-box/) to describe the purpose of widgets to end-users.

You can also use the [text widget](/refguide/text/) as it provides more features, for example, you can add parameters, and it generates semantically correct HTML.

{{% /alert %}}

A label shows static text, which describes the purpose of a specific widget to a user.
