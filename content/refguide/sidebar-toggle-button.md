## 1 Introduction

{{% alert type="info" %}}Sidebar toggles are not supported on native mobile pages, as scroll container regions are not supported.{{% /alert %}}

A **sidebar toggle** is a button that when pressed will make either a left or a right region of a [scroll container](scroll-container) appear or disappear. This makes it possible to create a sidebar that is hidden by default and can be shown by clicking the button.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
You can only have one sidebar toggle in a scroll container, and the behavior of the sidebar toggle is configured in the [scroll container region](scroll-container#region) properties.
{{% /alert %}}

For example, the image below shows for an example layout that uses the sidebar toggle to hide and make visible the **Left** region of the **Scroll Container**.

### 2.2 Design Properties Section{#design-properties}

{{% snippet file="refguide/design-section-link.md" %}}

### 2.3 General Section {#general}

#### 2.3.1 Caption {#caption}

The **Caption** property defines a text that will be shown on the sidebar toggle.

#### 2.3.3 Tooltip

The **Tooltip** property determines a text end-users will see in the tooltip that appears when they hover over the sidebar toggle. The tooltip text is translatable. For more information on translatable texts, see [Language Menu](translatable-texts). If the tooltip is not specified, no tooltip will be shown when hovering over the sidebar toggle.

#### 2.3.4 Icon {#icon}

The **Icon** property determines the icon that will be shown in front of the caption of the sidebar toggle. Possible options are: 

* no icon
* a glyphicon 
* a (bitmap) image

Glyphicons come from the Bootstrap Halflings collection. The advantages of a glyphicon over a bitmap image are that they are scalable, look sharp on high-resolution screens, and their color can be changed by changing the font color. The advantage of an image icon is that it can have multiple colors.

#### 2.3.5 Render Mode

Defines the way the sidebar toggle will be shown to the end-user. Possible options are the following:

* **Button** – the widget will be rendered as a button
* **Link** – the widget will be rendered as a hyperlink

*Default render mode:* Button

#### 2.3.6 Button Style

The **Button style** property applies a predefined styling to the sidebar toggle. Possible options are the following:

* Default
* Inverse
* Primary
* Info
* Success
* Warning
* Danger
