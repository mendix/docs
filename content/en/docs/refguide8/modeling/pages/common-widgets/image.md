## 1 Introduction

The image widget can be used to show a static image on a page, layout, or snippet.

For example, you can configure an image clicking which a page with customer details opens:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/modeling/pages/common-widgets/image/image-example.png" alt="Image Example" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

If you want to dynamically show different images based on data, you need to add [image viewer](/refguide8/image-viewer/) on your page.
