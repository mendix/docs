### Image

This property indicates which image will be shown in front of the caption of the button.

### Icon

The icon property determines the icon that will be shown in front of the caption of the button. There are three options: no icon, a glyph icon or a (bitmap) image. Glyph icons come from the Bootstrap Halflings collection. The advantages of a glyph icon over a bitmap image are that glyphs are scalable, look sharp on high-resolution screens and their color can be changed by changing the font color. The advantage of an image icon is that it can have multiple colors.
