## Introduction {#introduction}

The modules available in the Mendix Marketplace can be added to your app to provide new functionality with accompanying domain models and security options. These Marketplace modules function similarly to the [modules](/refguide/modules/) you create for your app. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}Extensions are a special type of modules that allows you to add new functionality to your development environment in Studio Pro. Extensions are part of your application, and therefore will become available to all members of your app who are developing it. Extensions come as part of [add-on modules](/refguide/consume-add-on-modules-and-solutions/). This means you can download them directly from the Marketplace.</br>Currently, extensions can only be created by Mendix Partners and are available from Studio Pro versions [10.6.3](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/#1063) and above.

When you download these modules, they will go into the **App** > **Marketplace modules** folder.
