Developers can ask questions about app development in Mendix, including how to apply concepts, best practices, and development patterns. It is built based on large language models (LLMs), using data from [Mendix Docs](/), [Mendix Community](https://community.mendix.com/), and [Mendix Academy](https://academy.mendix.com/).

### An Example of Interacting with Maia Chat

The following steps present an example of how you can interact with Maia Chat by asking your own question:

1. Type the following question in the chatbox: `When should I use a calculated attribute?`.
2. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the **Ask** button to send the question. You will then see the following:
    * An answer generated by Maia Chat
    * A copy icon ({{% icon name="copy" %}}) which allows you to copy the given answer to a clipboard (this option was added in 10.7.0)
    * Feedback icons
    * Top relevant references from various resources like Mendix documentation, Mendix Community, and Academy learning paths
