## 1 Introduction 

A **Navigation Document** in Mendix Studio shows a configured menu of your app in a form of a tree. You can create items and sub-items in your navigation. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/navigation/navigation-vs-app.png" >}}

To open the **Navigation Document**, click the corresponding icon in the left menu bar.

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/navigation/navigation-icon.png" alt="Navigation Document Icon" >}}

The **Navigation Document** consists of menu items that allow end-users navigate your app or that perform certain actions. For example, you can configure a menu item to open a specific page or to log an end-user out of their profile. For more information on actions you can assign to menu items, see the [Events Section](#events-section-navigation).

You can also add a sub-item to a menu item. Mind that you cannot assign an action to the menu item that has the sub-item.  

To create a new menu item, do the following:

1. Click the **Navigation Document** icon in the left menu bar to open the **Navigation**.

2. Click a plus at the bottom of the navigation tree to create a menu item, or click a plus next to the existing navigation item to create its sub-item

3. Specify the properties of the created item if needed (For more information, see [Properties of Menu Items](#properties-of-menu-items)). 

A new menu item or a sub-item is added to the navigation.

In Studio, you are viewing and editing a Responsive type of the navigation profile, while there are more types of profiles in Studio Pro. For more information on profiles in Studio Pro, see the [Profiles](/refguide/navigation/#profiles) section in *Navigation* in the *Studio Pro Guide*.

## 2 Navigation Editor Properties

In navigation editor properties, you can set a [default home page](#default-home-page) and [role-specific home pages](#role-specific-home-page). 

### 2.1 Default Home Page {#default-home-page}

You can set a page or a microflow as a default home page:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/navigation/default-home-page.jpg" alt="Default Home Page" >}}

The **Default Home Page** section consists of the following properties:

* **Page** – Allows you to set a page that is opened when an end-user opens the app. 
* **Microflow** – Allows you to set a microflow that is performed when an end-user opens the app. A microflow can be used to execute some logic or gather specific data that should be passed to the homepage.

A home page icon is displayed in a list of pages or microflows against a page or microflow that is set as a home page:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/navigation/home-icon.jpg" alt="Home Icon" >}}

### 2.2 Role-Specific Home Page {#role-specific-home-page}

A role-specific home page is a home page that that overrides the [default home page](#default-home-page) and is opened only for users with the specified role. You can set a separate home page per each role in your app. For more information on roles and how to create them, see [Security, Roles & Permissions](/studio/settings-security/).

For example, an Administrator role can have the **Admin_Dashboard** page as its home page, while other users will have the default home page opened when they open the app:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/navigation/role-specific-home-page.jpg" alt="Role-Specific Home Page" >}}

When adding or editing the role-specific home page, you can set the following properties:

* **Role** – Defines what role has a dedicated home page.

* **Type** – Defines whether a page or a microflow is opened/performed when the user opens the app. The following types are available:

  * **Page** – A page is set as a home page.
  * **Microflow** – A microflow is set as a home page, i.e. a microflow is performed when a user opens the app. A microflow can be used to execute some logic or gather specific data that should be passed to the homepage.

* **Page** – This property is only available when the **Type** is set to **Page**. Allows you to set a dedicated home page that is opened for the selected role.

* **Microflow** – This property is only available when **Type** is set to **Microflow**. Allows you to set a microflow that is performed when a user with the selected role opens the app.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/navigation/role-specific-home-page-properties.jpg" >}}

A role-specific home page icon is displayed in a list of pages or microflows against a page or microflow that is set as a home page:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio/navigation/role-specific-home-page-icon.jpg" alt="Role-Specific Home Page Icon" >}}

### 2.3 Adding a Role-Specific Home Page

1. Make sure your [security](/studio/settings-security/) is enabled and configured.

2. Open the navigation editor > Navigation Editor properties.

3. In the **Role-Specific Home Page** section, click the **Add Role-Specific Home Page**.
