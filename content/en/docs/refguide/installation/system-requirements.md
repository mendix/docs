## 1 Introduction

This document presents the system requirements for the various parts of the Mendix Platform.

## 2 Mendix Studio Pro {#sp}

Mendix Studio Pro has the requirements listed in the following sections.

### 2.1 Software Specifications {#software}

Mendix [Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling/) 10 is supported on 64-bit versions of Windows 10 release 1809 and above. This also includes Windows 11. Studio Pro 10 versions are enabled and tested to run on Apple Silicon Macs such as the M1, which requires [Parallels 17](https://www.parallels.com/) and Windows 11.

The following frameworks are required. They will be installed automatically by the Studio Pro installer if necessary:

* Microsoft .NET 6.0.x desktop runtime (x64) and all applicable Windows security patches
* Redistributable Package (x64)
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package (x64)
* A Java Developer Kit (JDK) version 11 - the flavor which will be installed, if Java 11 is not already installed on your machine, you are installing:
    * Eclipse Temurin JDK 11 (x64)
    
    Oracle JDK 11 can also be used if this is already installed.
* Git for Windows (x64)
* Mendix Native Mobile Builder
* Microsoft Edge WebView2 Evergreen Runtime (x64)

When you are running Studio Pro on a Parallels virtual machine on an ARM64 device (for example, an M1 Mac), you need the following dependencies in addition to the x64 version listed above:

* .NET 6 Desktop Runtime (arm64)
* Microsoft Edge WebView2 Evergreen Runtime (arm64)

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You can choose which JDK is used for building and running locally via the **Edit** > **Preferences** menu item in Studio Pro.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Please note the limitation that the database viewer built into Studio Pro (as described in [How to Share the Development Database](/howto/data-models/sharing-the-development-database/)) does not work with JDK 11.06 or 11.07.
{{% /alert %}}

### 2.2 Hardware Specifications {#hardware}

Mendix Studio Pro will run on any machine which can run the [minimum requirements for running Windows 10 64-bit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-specifications#primaryR2) with the following additional requirement:

* **Disk Space** – Studio Pro requires 2GB disk space to install, and each app you create will vary in size depending on the functionality, but will take a minimum of around 150MB.
* **RAM** – 4GB
* **Display Resolution** –  1080p (1920x1080)

### 2.3 Firewall Settings {#firewall-settings}

Studio Pro needs access to the following URLs in order to work. If your firewall is blocking these, you will need to safelist them:

* `*.mendix.com`
* `*.mendixcloud.com`
* `*.teamserver.sprintr.com`

To run a Mendix app, Mendix Studio Pro uses the following ports by default. If your firewall is blocking these, you will need to open them:

* 8080: runtime port
* 8083: mobile packager
* 8090: admin port
* 8100: sign-in port

For more information on ports and modifying Studio Pro's default ports, see [Configurations](/refguide/configuration/) and the [Troubleshooting Common Mobile Issues](/refguide/mobile/getting-started-with-mobile/prerequisites/#troubleshooting) section of *Native App Prerequisites and Troubleshooting*.

### 2.4 File Locations

For active development and running your application locally, your app folder should be on local drive (such as C:) or on a network folder that has been mapped to a [Windows drive letter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/map-a-network-drive-in-windows-10-29ce55d1-34e3-a7e2-4801-131475f9557d).

### 2.5 Supported Git Service Providers {#supported-providers}

#### 2.5.1 Azure Repos and Azure DevOps Server 

We support both Microsoft’s [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/) hosted Git service, and Azure DevOps Server (former Team Foundation Server) which is an on-premises solution for hosting your Git repos on private infrastructure.

To get a PAT for your user account, see the [Use personal access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page) instructions in the Microsoft documentation.

You need `Code (full)` permission for your token.

#### 2.5.2 GitHub 

We support GitHub’s hosting solutions, including the free GitHub.com cloud-hosted service and GitHub Enterprise, both hosted (Enterprise Cloud) and on-premises (Enterprise Server).

To get a PAT for your user account, see the [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instructions in the GitHub documentation. 

You need `repo` permissions for your token.

#### 2.5.3 GitLab 

We support all tiers of GitLab’s service, including GitLab.com, GitLab Community Edition, and GitLab Enterprise Edition.

To get a PAT for your user account , see the [Personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) instructions in the GitLab documentation. 

You need `write_repository` permission for the token.

#### 2.5.4 BitBucket 

We support all tiers of Atlassian’s BitBucket service, including BitBucket.org, BitBucket Server, and BitBucket Data Center on-premises solutions.

On BitBucket.org, the personal access token are called app passwords.

To setup an App Password for your BitBucket.org account, see the [App passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/) instructions.

BitBucket Server and BitBucket Data Center, on the other hand, still use the term "personal access token." To set up a personal access token, see the [Personal access tokens](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html) instructions.

In both cases you need `repository write` permission.

### 2.6 Graphics Card

If you are using the Intel® UHD Graphics 630 graphics processor, please ensure that you are using [driver version 27.20.100.9664](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Intel(R)+UHD+Graphics+630) or above.

## 3 Team Server {#ts}

The [Team Server](/developerportal/general/team-server/) is implemented using Git, and Studio Pro uses the HTTPS protocol to communicate with that server. To access the Team Server from within Studio Pro, the network at your location needs the following settings:

* The HTTPS port (TCP 443) needs to be open
* The HTTP port (TCP 80) needs to be open
* WebDAV (verbs within the HTTP protocol) needs to be enabled on the proxy server (if any)

## 7 Databases {#databases}

Mendix tries to support the most recent and patched database server versions from database vendors. We aim to add support for a new vendor version two minor Mendix versions after the vendor has released it. Dropping support for a database will be announced in the release notes at the date the vendor drops support. We will drop support two minor Mendix versions later.

Current support:

* [MariaDB](/refguide/mysql/): 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.11
* [Microsoft SQL Server](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-on-windows-microsoft-sql-server/): 2019, 2022
* [Azure SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level?view=sql-server-2017): v12 compatibility mode 140 or higher
* [MySQL](/refguide/mysql/): 8.0
* [Oracle Database](/refguide/oracle/): 19, 21c
* PostgreSQL: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
* [SAP HANA](/refguide/saphana/): 2.00.040.00.1545918182

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Each app must have its own database. Mendix apps cannot share data by sharing the same database.

If you want two apps to share the same database, then you need to share the data from one app to the other using APIs. In Mendix, these are supported by [Data Hub](/data-hub/share-data/) or the REST and OData services described in the [Integration](/refguide/integration/) section of the *Studio Pro Guide*. This is referred to as a microservices architecture.

For more information on why data cannot be shared between apps see [Data Storage](/refguide/data-storage/#databases). Use the [Database Replication](/appstore/modules/database-replication/) module if you need to copy the data from one app to another.

{{% /alert %}}

## 10 Mobile Operating Systems {#mobileos}

For native and progressive web apps built with Mendix, the following operating system versions are supported:

* Latest version of iOS
* Latest three versions of Android

Only devices running on these operating system versions receive up-to-date security fixes from their vendors and thus minimize being vulnerable to known exploits.

You can build native and progressive web apps with Mendix that run on older operating system versions than the ones we support. However, to receive official Mendix support you must demonstrate that your problem also occurs on a supported operating system version.

We recommend the following minimum hardware requirements for all mobile devices running native and progressive web Mendix apps:

* CPU: minimum 2 cores with 2 GHz
* Memory: minimum 2 GB

Depending on your app's complexity, these minimum hardware requirements might not be sufficient and should be adjusted.

## 11 MxBuild {#mxbuild}

MxBuild is a Windows and Linux command-line tool that can be used to build a Mendix Deployment Package. For more information, see [MxBuild](/refguide/mxbuild/).

* .NET 6.0
* JDK 11

## 12 mx Command-Line Tool {#mxtool}

The **mx** command-line tool is a Windows and Linux command-line tool that can be used to do useful things with your Mendix app. For more information, see [mx Command-Line Tool](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/).

* Mono v5.20.x or .NET v4.7.2
