## 1 Introduction

Button widgets perform an action when clicked. They can be rendered as a button or as a hyperlink. Button widgets can be divided into the following ones:

* **Action Button** – a general name for a button that performs a certain action. You can assign an action yourself or you can select a button with a preconfigured action, such as: 
  * Call microflow button
  * Call nanoflow button
  * Open page button
  * Save button
  * Cancel button
  * Link button
  * Close page button
  * Delete button
  * Synchronize button

* **Drop-Down Button** – shows a list of items, an action is performed when one of the items is clicked. A pop-up window with a list of possible actions appears when an end-user clicks a drop-down button:

  Different items can perform different actions. For more information on items and actions that can be assigned to them, see the [Item Section](button-properties#items) in *Button Properties*.
