## 1 Introduction

Mendix uses visual models called microflows to define the logic of your application. Microflows are visual ways of expressing what traditionally would be written in code. This how-to explains how you can create a very simple "Hello World" microflow.

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Create a menu item
* Create and edit a microflow

## 2 Creating a Menu Item {#CreatingaMenuItem}

Microflows can be triggered in many different ways (for details, see [Trigger Logic Using Microflows](/howto7/logic-business-rules/triggering-logic-using-microflows/)). For this how-to, you'll be using a menu item to trigger the new microflow.

To create a menu item, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Navigation** editor, add a menu item in the desktop navigation settings, and enter the caption of *Hello World*:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/18580978.png" >}}

2. Click **Select...** in the **Target** section of the **New Menu Item** dialog box to open the **Select Navigation Target** pop-up window:

3. For **On click**, select **Call a microflow**:

4. In the **Select Microflow** dialog box, select a microflow and then click **New**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/microflow.png" >}}

5. Enter *HelloWorld* for the **Name** of the new microflow.
6. Save the new menu item by clicking **OK**.

## 3 Editing the New Microflow

To edit the new microflow, follow these steps:

1. Open the new microflow by right-clicking the new menu item created in [2 Creating a Menu Item](#CreatingaMenuItem) and selecting **Go to target** from the context menu:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/18580975.png" >}}

    You will see an empty microflow like this:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/18580974.png" >}}

2. Open the **Toolbox** in the lower-right corner of the Modeler:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/18580967.png" >}}

3. Drag a **Show message** action from the **Toolbox** to the line between the green start event and red end event, which will insert a show message action activity:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/18580972.png" >}}

4. Double-click the message activity to open the **Show Message** properties editor.
5. Enter *Hello World* for the **Template** value and click **OK**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/18580970.png" >}}

6. Run the application locally and click **View** to see the application in your default browser:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/logic-business-rules/create-your-first-microflow-hello-world/18580968.png" >}}

7. Locate the new navigation item in the menu bar and click it to see the message.
