## 1 Introduction

Aggregate List can be used to calculate aggregated values such as the maximum, minimum, sum, average and total number of objects over a list of objects.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

See [Common Properties](microflow-element-common-properties) for properties that all activities share (e.g. caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.

{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Input Properties

### 2.1 List

The name of the list to compute an aggregate over.

## 3 Action Properties

### 3.1 Function

Defines which type of aggregation is applied.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sum | The sum of all values of an attribute from the list of objects. |
| Average | The average of all values of an attribute from the list of objects. |
| Count | The total number of objects in the list. |
| Minimum | The minimum of all values of an attribute from the list of objects. |
| Maximum | The maximum of all values of an attribute from the list of objects. |

### 3.2 Attribute
