With the 'Show page' action you can show a page to the end user.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

See [Microflow Element Common Properties](microflow-element-common-properties) for properties that all activities share (e.g. caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

## Input Properties

### Object to pass

Object that will be passed to the opened page. This object will be used by [data views](data-view) with data source "caller of the page".

## Action Properties

### Page

The [page](page) to show to the end user. If the Object to pass is specified, the page must contain a data view connected to the same entity as the passed object (or its generalization).

<div class="alert alert-success">{% markdown %}

You can generate a new page to show by clicking 'Select...' and then 'New'. If you have selected an Object to pass the Modeler will automatically generate a data view to edit that object.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Page title

By default the title of the page is determined by the page title property of the page. You can replace this title with a custom title if necessary.

<div class="alert alert-success">{% markdown %}

This feature allows you to re-use the same page for the New and Edit buttons of a data grid. By simply setting the titles to, for example, 'New customer' and 'Edit customer', you can save yourself the trouble of duplicating the rest of the page.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Location

Location defines how the page is shown.

| Option | Description |

| Pop-up | The page is opened in a new dialog on top of the existing page(s). |
| Blocking pop-up | The page is opened in a new dialog on top of the existing page(s) and a hover, that makes it impossible to navigate to another page, is put on top of the underlying page(s). |
