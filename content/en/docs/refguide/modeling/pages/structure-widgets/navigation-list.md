## 1 Introduction

A navigation list can be used to attach an action to an entire row when a user clicks this row. Such a row is called a navigation list item. 

For example, clicking one row can open a page, clicking another one can execute a microflow.

#### 5.1.2 General Section

In the **General** section, you can set a specific on click event for each navigation list item. An on click event defines what action is performed when a user clicks a row. For more information on on click events, see [On Click Event and Events Section](/refguide/on-click-event/).

Microflows set as an on click event for a navigation list item have no **Execution**, **Confirmation**, or **Advanced** microflow settings. For more information on calling a microflow, see [On Click Event and Events Section](/refguide/on-click-event/#call-microflow).
