## Introduction

The [Tab Swipe](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/78620/) widget can be used for navigating between tabs.

## Usage

To use this widget, follow these steps:

1. Place the widget in the same page, container, or snippet as the target tab container (which will be right below it).
2. On the **General** tab of the widget's properties, add the **Target tab name** for the container (this is found in the **Common** tab of the tab container).
