You can use the radio buttons to choose if these variables are defined as server time or Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

 **If you want the scheduled event to be executed at regular intervals instead of just once, place a check mark at 'Repeat'. After this you can use the drop-down menus at 'Interval' and 'Interval type' to define the interval between repetitions.**
