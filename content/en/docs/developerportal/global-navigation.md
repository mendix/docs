## Introduction

The global navigation top bar and menu work the same in **Apps** as they do in other browser-based parts of the Mendix Portal (for example, [Mendix Marketplace](/appstore/) and [Mendix Catalog](/catalog/)). 

The global navigation is always accessible throughout the online Mendix Platform.

## Global Navigation Menu {#global-navigation}

On the left side of the top bar, click **Open Global Navigation** ({{% icon name="layout-rounded-1" %}}) to access the main menu:

Click the menu items to navigate to different parts of the Mendix Platform, or hover over the menu items to expand the sections for further access.

## Search

In the **Search** box, you can search the platform for **Docs**, **Forum** posts, public **Marketplace** content, and **Academy** content.

Use the various filters to refine your search results:

## Support Menu

Click **Open Support Menu** ({{% icon name="question-circle" color="color" %}}) to read up on [what's new](https://www.mendix.com/releases/) in the Mendix Platform, [ask a question](/community-tools/mendix-community/#questions-tab) to the Mendix community, [share an idea](/community-tools/mendix-community/#ideas-tab) with the community, explore more [Mendix documentation](/), or contact [Mendix Support](/support/).

If you see **Get Started with Mendix**, a red dot next to this menu item will remain there for 30 days after your signup.
{{% /alert %}}

## Notifications Menu {#notifications}

Click **Open Notifications Menu** ({{% icon name="alarm-bell" %}}) to see the platform notifications you have received. Clicking the notification itself takes you to the source.

To configure what types of notifications you receive, click **Settings** ({{% icon name="cog" %}}) and update the options in the [Notification Settings](/community-tools/mendix-profile/user-settings/#notifications) page that opens.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
To stop receiving notifications when new feedback is submitted for a specific app, go to the [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page for that app and click **Stop Watching**. To disable notifications for multiple apps on one page, use the **Stop Watching** option on the [My Apps](/developerportal/#my-apps) page.

You can also sign out from the Mendix Platform via this menu.
