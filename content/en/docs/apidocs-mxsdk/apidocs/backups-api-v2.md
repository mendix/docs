## Introduction

The Backups API v2 lets you manage backups of the data in your app hosted in Mendix Cloud.

Data snapshots consist of a PostgreSQL database dump and all the file objects referenced from the database.

Database archives are a zip file which contains all the data in the snapshot, or the database and files separately if you prefer. 

You cannot currently upload an archive through this API. This function is currently only supported via the [Mendix Portal](/developerportal/operate/backups/). However, you can use this API to restore data from an existing environment snapshot.

This API focuses on working with snapshots and archives asynchronously, because these can be very long-running tasks for large quantities of data. It replaces the deprecated Backups API v1.

## Authentication

The Backups API requires authentication via API keys that are bound to your Mendix account.

### Obtaining an API Key

To obtain a Mendix API key, follow the instructions in the [API Keys](/community-tools/mendix-profile/user-settings/#profile-api-keys) section of *Mendix Profile*.

### Using Authentication Headers

Use the following request headers to authenticate an API call:

* `Mendix-Username` – the login name of the requesting user with the required privileges in the Mendix Platform
* `Mendix-ApiKey` – the API key of this user

### Configuring Permissions

To perform an action via the Backups API, you need **Access to Backups** and **API Rights** permissions. This can be configured from the [Permissions tab](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/#permissions-tab) of your app's **Environments** page.

## Examples

### Downloading a Backup of Your Data

To download a backup of your data, do as follows:

1. Make sure that you have an API key and the **API Access** and **Backups** permissions.

2. If the snapshot already exists, find the [snapshot ID](/developerportal/operate/backups/#backups-details).

3. If the snapshot does not exist, call `POST /api/v2/apps/<ProjectId>/environments/<EnvironmentId>/snapshots` to create a snapshot. For more information, see the [Request Creation of an Environment Snapshot](#request-creation-snapshot) section below.

4. Use the value of `snapshot_id` in the output to create an archive file from the snapshot. To do so, call `POST /api/v2/apps/<ProjectId>/environments/<EnvironmentId>/snapshots/<SnapshotId>/archives`. For more information, see the [Request Creation of a Snapshot Archive](#request-creation-archive) section below.

5. Use the value of `archive_id` in the output to check whether the creation of the archive is completed. To do so, call `GET /api/v2/apps/<ProjectId>/environments/<EnvironmentId>/snapshots/<SnapshotId>/archives/<ArchiveId>`. For more information, see the [Request Status of Creation of an Archive](#request-status-archive) section below.

6. After the archive is created, use the value of `url` in the output to download the backup archive.

### Request a Restore of a Snapshot to an Environment

#### Description

Restore a previously created backup snapshot to an environment. The environment to which the data will be restored must be stopped before using this call. The response of a successful call contains the details of the request. This call is only available for Mendix Cloud applications. Please note that the `source_snapshot_id` can be a snapshot created for a different environment, similar to the "restore into" functionality in the Mendix Portal.

```bash
HTTP Method: POST
URL: https://deploy.mendix.com/api/v2/apps/<ProjectId>/environments/<EnvironmentId>/restores
```

#### Request

**Request Parameters**

* *ProjectId* (String): Unique project identifier. Can be looked up via the [Mendix Portal](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) or [apps API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/#list-apps).
* *EnvironmentId* (String): Unique environment identifier. Can be looked up via the [Mendix Portal](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) or [environments API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/#list-environments).

**Query Parameters**

* *source_snapshot_id* (String): Identifier of the snapshot that will be restored. This value is required; it must belong to a snapshot within the same application, although it could be a different environment.
* *db_only* (Boolean): Boolean flag. Set this to *true* if you are doing a database-only restore operation. It defaults to *false* if not present.

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}Setting `db_only` to `true` will not restore any of your files, leading to a risk that data will be missing from your app or that your app will not work as expected. Use this option with caution.
    {{% /alert %}}
