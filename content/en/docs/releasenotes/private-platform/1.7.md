## 1.7.0

### Release date: February 26, 2024

Version 1.7.0 of Private Mendix Platform introduces several key features related to the Marketplace, Platform experience, and improvements to the Build and Deploy (CI/CD) capabilities.

#### New Features

##### Statistics Dashboard for Platform Usage

The dashboard allows company admins to view the Platform usage statistics and get a quick graphical representation of ongoing Platform activity through metrics like project creation, collaboration activity, and so on.

##### Platform Notifications

Enjoy more interactivity across users and stay more up-to-date thanks to the newly introduced Notifications feature on the Platform. App invites now display as notifications in the top bar of the Platform, which unfolds a notification center with additional information and links to the relevant projects or pages.

#### Improvements

##### Marketplace Uploads Approval Policies

Better, more fine-grained governance controls for setting the approval policies for user-uploaded content in the Private Mendix Platform Marketplace. You can configure approvals for the following:

* Marketplace components in general
* Marketplace component versions individually

You can also set a component version to be unchangeable, to prevent versions from being edited after publication.

##### CI/CD Experience Improvements

Private Mendix Platform 1.7 contains various UI and UX improvements related to the setting of Build and Deploy capabilities, as well as the configuration of relevant service integrations and resource usage.

##### Engineering Improvements

###### Random Names for Environment Creation

For a more user-friendly environment creation process, a random unique name for each environment is generated as its identifier. The environment name is set as a human-readable label and displayed across the Platform where relevant. The technical name (or identifier) of the environment is now separate from the user-friendly label.
