## Introduction

The **My Group Apps** page shows an overview of all apps owned by the groups to which a user belongs.

It contains the following elements:

* Search bar - Use the search bar to search through apps by name or description.
* A card for each app owned by all your user groups.

   * If you are a member of this app's project team, you can click the card to see the app details. 
   * If you are not a member of the project, clicking the card opens a dialogue window with basic information about this app. From there, you can click **Request Access** to notify the app owner that you want to join the app team. If the app has been deployed, you can also click **Launch App** to open the URL of this app's most recently deployed environment.
