## 1 What Is the Developer Portal?

The [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com) is one of the three key components of the Mendix Platform. The other two are [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling) and [Mendix Studio](/studio/). In the Developer Portal, Mendix developers can collaborate, deploy, and manage their apps, and manage their company and users. 

The Developer Portal also offers open, well-defined APIs, enabling third-party developers to integrate their own widgets and plugins. For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/).

You can navigate the menu items in the header:

## 2 Apps

In [Apps](apps-list/), you can find your free and licensed apps, nodes, and other apps created by your company:

If you are an App Team member, you can go to the app [Buzz](collaborate/buzz). Here you can  manage not only the deployment of the app itself but the entire development process via user stories which can be refined and allocated to Sprints.

You can pin/unpin your app by clicking on the pin icon at the bottom right of your app card. You will find your pinned apps into the "Pinned" tab.
