The starts-with() function tests whether a String attribute starts with a specific string.

```
//Sales.Customer[starts-with(Name, 'Jans')]

```

This query returns all customers from which the name starts with the string 'Jans'. Customers with the name 'Jansen' or 'Jans' will be returned, because both names start with 'Jans'.
