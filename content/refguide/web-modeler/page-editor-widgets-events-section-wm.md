## 1 Introduction 

The **Events** section is a section in the **Properties** tab that is common for different widgets in the Web Modeler, for example, for a static image, buttons, list view, and data view. 

In the **Events** section, you can set the **On Click Action** for widgets and specify what action will be performed when users click the widget. For example, you can specify that when a user clicks a profile image, the page with the user's personal account will open.

### 2.3 Delete Object Action {#delete-object-action}

Behavior of the **Delete Object** action depends on a data container it is placed in: a [list view](page-editor-data-view-list-view-wm#list-view-properties) or a [data view](page-editor-data-view-list-view-wm#data-view-properties). 

#### 2.3.1 Delete Object Action in a List View

If you place the **Delete Object** in a list view, the corresponding list view item will be deleted, when a user clicks a button.

For example, you have a page with a list view showing customer names. A **Delete** button is placed inside the list next to each name. Thus, if you click **Delete** in a line that says "Peter", this customer and all customer's details will be deleted.

#### 2.3.2 Delete Object Action in a Data View

When placed on a data view, **Delete Object** will delete the connected object. For example, you opened a page with customer's details. The details are placed in a data view. You have **Save** and **Delete** buttons at the bottom of the page. When you press **Delete**, the customer "John" and customer's details will be deleted and the page will be closed.
