## 1 Introduction

Mendix hosts a variety of services in the cloud. These include the environments for apps that are deployed to Mendix Cloud, as well as various online services (such as Buzz Project Management).

The status of all these services is reported on the [Mendix Platform Status](https://status.mendix.com/) page.

## 2 Mendix Cloud Statuses

You can check the status of Mendix Cloud by going to the [Mendix Platform Status](https://status.mendix.com/) page. This page tells you if there are any issues with Mendix Cloud that may impact your apps.

You can expand the status of the cloud to see the status of a particular region. For example, you can expand **Mendix Cloud** to see the status for **Mendix Cloud EU**.
