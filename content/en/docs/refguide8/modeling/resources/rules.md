## Introduction

A rule is a special kind of microflow. Its result should be an enumeration or a Boolean and it can be used in a [decision](/refguide8/decision/) to make a decision based on that result. The idea is that complicated decisions can be consolidated in rules and reused in various places.

## Differences from Microflows

Rules are very similar to microflows; see the documentation on [Microflows](/refguide8/microflows/) for more information on how to build a rule. There are only a few differences between rules and microflows:

* A rule can only be used in a decision
* The return type has to be Boolean or enumeration
* A rule cannot change data in the database; the actions to create, delete, change and rollback objects are not available in rules
* A rule cannot interact with the client; the actions to show or close forms, show messages, send validation feedback and download files are not available in rules
* A rule cannot call web services, generate documents or import XML
