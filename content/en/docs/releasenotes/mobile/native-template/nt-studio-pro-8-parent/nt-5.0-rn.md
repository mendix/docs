As of August 2020, Google Play requires apps to be built targeting SDK 29. This version of the Native Template complies with these requirements. For more information, see [Target API level requirements for the Play Console](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469#targetsdk).

## 5.0.0

**Release date: August 7, 2020**

Mendix Studio Pro [8.12.1](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.12/#8121) introduces better splash screen support for native mobile apps. As the new functionality requires new native dependencies, the changes are not backwards-compatible with previous Mendix Studio versions. 

In the first implementation, splash screens were static resources controlled by the native side of the app. While good enough in simple cases, they were inadequate for longer synchronizing sessions where the splash screen could toggle off too soon.

With the new implementation, splash screens are fully togglable via the client. That means that the client has full control over the splash screen. That translates to better on/off timing and fewer missed frames for longer synchronizing sessions.
