## 1 Introduction 

Mendix Studio and Mendix Studio Pro will be fused in one IDE in Mendix 10. Starting from Mendix 9.21, Mendix only features Studio Pro, meaning that Mendix 9.20 is the latest version you can use for Studio. For more information on fusion, see the [Coming in 2023: The Merging of Studio and Studio Pro](https://www.mendix.com/blog/coming-in-2023-the-merging-of-studio-and-studio-pro/) blog post.

Therefore, we are encouraging Studio users to switch to Studio Pro before Mendix 10 release. This document outlines the steps a Studio developer needs to take to install Studio Pro, know their way around it, and start developing with it.

## 2 Moving from Studio to Studio Pro

To start using Studio Pro for your app modeling, do the following:

1. [Download and install Studio Pro](/refguide9/install/). From Studio, you can initiate the download by clicking the **More Options** icon > **Edit in Studio Pro** in the top menu bar. This path ensures that you downloaded the same Mendix version for Studio Pro as your Studio app:

2. After you downloaded and installed Studio Pro, sign in to Studio Pro with your Mendix credentials. 

3. Find and open your app from the list of apps:
