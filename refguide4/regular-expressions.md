A regular expression describes a set of criteria that a string can match. In the [validation rules](validation-rules) of an entity a regular expression can be used to validate whether an attribute of type String matches these criteria.

A regular expression has the following properties.

## Common

### Name

The name can be used to refer to the regular expression from a [validation rule](validation-rules) of an entity.

### Documentation

This is for documentation purpose only; it is not visible in the end-user application that you are modeling.

## Expression

The expression defines the criteria that a string should be checked against in a formal, internationally standardized regular expression language.

Expression: [1-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] ?[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]
Examples (excluding the quotes): "3024EL" and "7500 AH"
Criteria:

*   The first character is a digit in the range 1 to 9.
*   The second, third and fourth characters are digits in the range 0 to 9.
*   The last two characters are letters, as expressed by the last two subexpression [A-Za-z], which indicate that the last two characters should be in the range A-Z or the range a-z.
*   Between the digits and the letters there can be a space, as expressed by the subexpression which consists of a space and a question mark. The question mark indicates that the space occurs never or once.

### Subexpressions

A regular expression consists of a sequence of subexpressions. A string matches a regular expression if all parts of the string match these subexpressions in the same order.

A regular expression can contain the following types of subexpressions:

* [ ] - **A bracket expression** - Matches a single character that is indicated within the brackets. Examples:

    *   [abc] matches "_a_", "_b_", or "_c_".
    *   [a-z] specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from "_a_" to "_z_".
    These forms can be mixed: [abcx-z] matches "_a_", "_b_", "_c_", "_x_", "_y_", or "_z_", and is equivalent to [a-cx-z]. 
    The - character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first character within the brackets, or if it is escaped with a backslash \.
    In the zip code example above the four bracket expressions [0-9] indicates that the first 4 characters should be digits, and the two bracket expressions [A-Za-z] indicate that the last two characters should be letters.

* [^ ] - Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets.
For example, [^abc] matches any character other than "a", "b", or "c". [^a-z] matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from "a" to "z". As above, literal characters and ranges can be mixed. |

* {m,n} - Matches the preceding element at least _m_ and not more than _n_ times.
For example, a{3,5} matches only "_aaa_", "_aaaa_", and "_aaaaa_".

* {n} - Matches the preceding element exactly n times.
For example, using this construct the expression of the Dutch zip code example above would be:
[0-9]{4} ?[a-zA-Z]{2} |

 * . - **A dot** - Matches any single character. If you want to match a dot, you can escape it by prefixing it with a \ (backslash).

* **A literal character**
    * A character that does not have a special meaning in the regular expression language matches itself. Example:
        *   In the Dutch zip code example above the space is such a character that just matches itself.
* \w - **A word** - a letter, digit or underscore. \w is an abbreviation for [A-Za-z0-9_]

* \d - **A digit** - \d is an abbreviation for [0-9] 

### Quantifiers

The number of times that a subexpression may occur in a string is indicated by a quantifier after the subexpression. If no quantifier is present, the subexpression must occur exactly once.

The following quantifiers can be used:

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| ? | The preceding subexpression should occur not or once. |
| * | The preceding subexpression occurs any number of times. |
| + | The preceding subexpression should occur once or more. |
|   | No quantifier means that the preceding subexpression should occur exactly once. |
