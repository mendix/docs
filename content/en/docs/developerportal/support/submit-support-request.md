## 1 Introduction

In order for Mendix Support to pick up and process your support request, it is important to provide the right information. This will speed up the processing of your request and minimize back-and-forth communication between you and Mendix Support. The details below are what Mendix Support needs and uses to process an incident ticket.

## 2 Checking Useful Links Before Submitting a Request

Before submitting a new Menix Support request, check these resources to make sure your question has not already been answered:

* [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendix.com)
* [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/)
* [Mendix Platform status](https://status.mendix.com)

If you cannot find the answer to your question on the Mendix Forum or in the Mendix documentation, you can submit a support request. The Mendix Support Portal will walk you through the ticket creation by asking for relevant information based on the type of request. 

## 3 Submitting a New Request {#submitting}

You can access the Mendix Support Portal at [support.mendix.com](https://support.mendix.com).

This is the basic information required for a ticket:

* A detailed description of the exact error
* A detailed description of the action that was performed when the error was received
* A description of the desired goal (optional)
* The affected app (for more information, see [How to Prepare Your App for Support](/developerportal/support/prepare-your-project/))

To submit a request with Mendix Support, follow these steps:

1. Click **Submit a request** in the upper-right corner of the portal.

5. Make sure all your attachments have finished uploading before clicking **Next**.

The Mendix Support Portal will first suggest relevant documentation for you to read before you submit a request. Based on a complexity check, recommendations might be skipped to improve your experience. This complexity check takes your request priority and other factors into consideration.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/support/submit-support-request/recommendations.png" >}}

If investigating the documentation and searching the [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com/index4.html) does not help you solve your issue, you can submit the Mendix Support request.	

## 4 Request Priority {#request-priority}

You can select the priority that you feel the request should have. Please note the [SLA regulations](/developerportal/support/#sla) for this priority.
