## 1 Introduction

The [Portfolio Management](https://portfolio.mendix.com) tool enables staying informed about projects and managing them in the different development stages. It provides portfolio managers, business stakeholders, and developers with everything they need to collaborate effectively in one place and bring project ideas to the Mendix Platform.

{{% alert type="info" %}}The Portfolio Management app is available to all Mendix Cloud customers. Mendix Admins can access all portfolios within their company.{{% /alert %}}

To start the Portfolio Management app, go to the Developer Portal, open the [Switch to menu](/developerportal/), and select **Portofolio**.

## 2 Projects Overview {#projects-overview}

After you start the Portfolio Management app, you see all the portfolios of your company. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/landing-page.png" >}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}When a Mendix Admin starts the Portfolio Management app for the first time and if their company has no portfolio, the system will automatically create a portfolio for the company.{{% /alert %}}

Click a portfolio to open the **Project Overview** page, which gives an overview of all the projects in this portfolio.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/projects-overview.png" >}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}For the Beta version, it is only possible to have one portfolio board for an organization. We aim to provide the capability to create multiple portfolio boards in later versions. Stay tuned.{{% /alert %}}

On the top of the page, you can search for a project in the search bar.

On the upper-right corner, you can use the **Filters** to filter projects. Using the drop-down list next to the **Filters**, you can [change your view](#change-view). Clicking the **Create New Project** button allows you to [create a new project](#create-new-project).

### 2.1 Creating a New Project {#create-new-project}

In the Portfolio Management app, the term "Project" refers to a software project that you manage as you work along the development lifecycle. An app can be the result of multiple projects (if the app is complex and big) or only one project. For progress tracking, we recommend you to break down an app into smaller projects whenever possible.

{{% alert type="info" %}}Only Portfolio Managers can create a new project. For more information on roles and permissions, see [Access Management](#access-management).{{% /alert %}}

2. [Add general information.](#add-general-information)
3. [Add planning information.](#add-planning-information)
