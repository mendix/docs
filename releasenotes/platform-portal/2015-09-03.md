## New features

*   All expanded items in the backlog can be collapsed at once, by using either the new 'Collapse All' button in the toolbar or the keyboard shortcut <ctrl+space>.
*   New stories can be pre-filled with a default set of tasks, which can be defined as a Story Template on the Capture page (click More>Manage story templates).

## Improvements

*   The signup process takes less time to complete
*   The 'details' link of each story in the backlog is now always visible, making it easier to access to the story details page.

## Bug fixes

*   Removed the unnecessary confirmation popup at the end of the sign up process.
