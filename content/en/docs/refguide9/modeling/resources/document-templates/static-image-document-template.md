## Appearance Properties

### Image

This property defines the image that will appear in the document.

### Width

The width defines the width of the image in the document. This is set in pixels and using the PPI in the document template this will be recalculated to actual printing size. Either width or height can be set; to prevent distortion of the image it is not possible to set both.

### Height

The height defines the height of the image in the document. This is set in pixels and using the PPI in the document template this will be recalculated to actual printing size. Either width or height can be set; to prevent distortion of the image it is not possible to set both.
