## 1 Introduction

Your Mendix Profile is your main point of contact with members of the Mendix community. It displays your activities on the Mendix Platform and details about your background. To get more involved in the Mendix community, your profile is the best place to start. 

You can access your Mendix profile by clicking your picture in the upper-right corner of the Developer Portal and then selecting **See Your Profile**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
By default, any newly created Mendix account comes with its own Mendix Profile.
{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Header {#header}

Your profile header displays a quick overview of information about you. Your Mendix experience in level and points, your number of [credits](#challenges), and your number of [connections](#connections) are all found here. You can also select up to four featured [badges](#badges) to display your progress on the Mendix Platform. If you have a certificate from the Mendix [Academy](https://academy.mendix.com), this will also be displayed. The **Personal Info** card presents other information.

You can change these details in the [Settings](#settings).

## 3 Overview and Stats

Your profile opens to the **Overview** tab, which shows you at a quick glance how you are doing on the platform. You can see the following:

* Stats 
* Badges in progress and the next badges to work towards
* Assigned challenge
* Personal information
* Invitations
* Position on the leaderboard
* Portfolio

The first profile card below the header presents your **Stats**, which are your points divided between Mendix products and activities:

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/stats.png"   width="350"  >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Don't get disappointed about a low number of points, because everyone in the Mendix community started like that, even our Expert developers! There are plenty of opportunities to gain more points and climb the [Leaderboard](#leaderboard).
{{% /alert %}}

## 4 Badges {#badges}

In addition to the **Stats** chart, on the **Overview** tab you gain an overview of your **Badges**. These badges represent your achievements and progress on the Mendix Platform. You can see your **Badges in Progress** as well as **Next Badges**. The badges are color-coded based from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare).

To see all your badges as well as the badges you can work towards, click **View all** to go to the **Badges** tab of your profile. On that tab, you can select up to four badges from the **Earned badges** section to make visible in your profile [header](#header) by clicking **Select as featured**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the **Earned badges** section, you find the badges you have completed. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown.
{{% /alert %}}

The percentage on the card of the **Badges in progress** shows how far you have come to earn that particular badge. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown, so don't get distracted while earning it!

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/badges.png"   width="350"  >}}

## 5 Challenges {#challenges}

The **Challenge** card presents a featured challenge you can complete to gain credits. You can use the credits in the [Mendix Shop](https://shop.mendix.com) to order low-code t-shirts or other Mendix swag. Some challenges are going to be easy for you, whilst others might be harder to complete!

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/challenges.png"   width="350"  >}}

Click **View All** to go to the **Challenges** tab of your profile. This tab presents more details on the challenge steps, the time left, and how many credits you can earn with them. You can complete these activities in any order you like.

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/credits.png"   width="350"  >}}

When you complete a challenge, click **Claim Credits** to claim the Mendix credits. You can then spend your credits on cool items in the Mendix Shop.

## 6 Connections {#connections}

One of the greatest strengths of Mendix is our awesome developers community, and the **Connections** card is the perfect place to start connecting to other Mendix developers. When you get an invitation to connect, you can check out their profile and decide whether to accept or ignore it. 

You can also see a list of people you may know so that you can add further connections to your profile. To connect with someone, click the plus icon to send an invitation.

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/connections.png"   width="350"  >}}

Clicking **View All** on the card will bring you to the **Connections** tab of your profile. On this tab, you can invite friends and colleagues to Mendix in two ways:

* **Share URL** – copy the personalized invite link and share it directly
* **Send Invite** – send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/referral.png"   width="500"  >}}

## 7 Leaderboard {#leaderboard}

This card on your profile presents your points and ranking for the last 30 days:

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/leaderboard.png" width="500px" alt="Leaderboard example" >}}

Clicking **View All** takes you to the **Leaderboards** page, where you can view leaders per category, for the whole Mendix Platform, or for your company only.

You can climb the leaderboard by earning points through various activities on the Mendix Platform. For example, let's say you have some time to spare while your app is deploying. You get a cup of coffee and check out the [Mendix Forum]. One questions pops out because you came across a similar problem a few weeks back. You decide to help the community member and post an answer to their question. Not long after, the author marks your answer as accepted. Boom! 15 points right there.

You can also view other developers and their apps to get inspired. You can also click **View All Projects** to go to the **Portfolio** tab, which presents all of your apps.

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/portfolio.png" width="500px" alt="Portfolio example" >}}

To add an app to your portfolio, click **Add Project**, which will open the editor. There are tips in the editor for what you should put in each field. All the fields in the editor are required before submission.

If you cannot finish your portfolio entry or do not want to publish yet, click **Save as Draft** to finish it later. The draft will be visible only to you in the **Portfolio** tab for further editing.

## 9 Activity

On the **Activity** tab, you can see a list of the last 20 public events for your badges, Marketplace, and Forum activity.

## 10 User Settings {#settings}

You can edit the information on your Mendix Profile by clicking **User Settings**. The **Settings** page has a navigation pane that allows you to edit the sections described below.

### 10.1 Profile {#profile}

In this section, you can upload your profile image and fill in your personal and work details

You can tell the Mendix community about yourself and your work experience. Let everyone know your area of expertise by filling in your **Industry** and **Skills**.  

You can also connect your social accounts via **Twitter URL** and **LinkedIn URL**.

You can also choose to make your profile public (which will allow the Mendix community to view your profile) by clicking **Make Profile Public**. Be sure to do the following to make your profile public:

* Add an avatar
* Enter a **Job Title**, **Department**, and **Country of Residence**
* Add some details **About You**
* Add at least one **Skill**
* Add at least one **Industry Experience** item

{{% alert color="info" %}}
To make your public profile private again, click **Make Profile Private**. 
{{% /alert %}}

You can also add a **Recover Email** address, which is useful if you lose access to your account or Mendix Profile. You can provide a non-business email address for this.

#### 10.1.1 Merging Profiles {#merging-profiles}

If you own two (or more) user accounts, Mendix recommendeds merging the profiles of these user accounts with each other. This saves you from having to maintain multiple profiles, and your community contributions will be stored with the one profile you actively use. As a result, you will have a stronger single Mendix Profile, and you will not have to keep track of your progress scattered in multiple profiles in the platform.

The **Merge Profile** process merges the information associated with the merged profiles, resulting in a single Mendix Profile with two (or more) user accounts related to it. For details on what information ends up in the resulting merged profile, see the [Results of Merge Process](#merge-profile-result) section below.

These are the prerequisites for the profile merge actions:

* Own two (or more) user accounts
* Have platform access with at least one of these user accounts
* Be able to receive emails for the user profiles that will be merged (this can be your email address used to log in or a profile email address)

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
You should also prepare for the merge by adding your new account to the relevant apps of your old account. Mendix recommends doing this so that you do not lose access to the apps of your old account, and also so you do not need a new invitation to those apps to gain access.
{{% /alert %}}

Before you start with a new profile merge action, it is important to understand what scenarios are possible and what it means for the profile merge process. The following starting scenarios are possible:

* **All user accounts give you access to the Mendix Platform** – If you have access to the platform with all your user accounts, you are able to initiate a merge after signing in with any of the accounts. For the other profile, a confirmation email message is sent that enables starting the merge action.
* **One of the user accounts gives you access to the Mendix Platform** – If you have access to only one of your user accounts, the profile merge process can only be initiated from that account. Furthermore, the user account you signed in with determines what profile information ends up in the resulting merged profile in the case of properties where the system cannot determine the information that should be kept. For the other profile, a confirmation email message is sent that enables starting the merge action. 
* **None of the user accounts gives you access to the Mendix Platform** – You should own at least one user account that provides access to the Mendix Platform.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
If you do not have access to any of the email addresses linked to the user accounts/profiles that you want to merge and you cannot log in with the Mendix Profile you want to merge, click **Create Support Request**  to go to Mendix Support. Mendix Support will contact you to change the profile **Recovery** email. Once this is done, you will be able to follow the steps below. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
When merging user profiles, a merge confirmation is needed for the user account you are not signed in with. The verification code that you need to confirm the merge operation will arrive by email. Therefore, you must be able to receive the verification email in an email inbox that is associated with the user account or the associated profile.  
{{% /alert %}}

#### 10.1.2 Merge Process

Follow these steps to merge your profiles:

1. Click **Merge Profile**.
2. In the dialog box that appears, enter the email address of one of the accounts linked to the profile you want to transfer information from. Then click **Next**.
3. You will be asked to choose an email address to receive a verification code, so choose an email address you have access to. This step is needed to verify that you are the owner of the Mendix Profile you are trying to merge.
4. Enter the verification code you received via the selected email address.
5. After clicking **Verify**, you will see an overview of the profile information that will be deleted and the information that will be kept. This includes earned points, achievements, credits, certifications, and Academy progress that will be merged to your target profile.
6. To proceed with the merge, click **Merge**. You will be notified once the merge is completed.

{{% alert color="info" %}} 
With the merge, the accounts of both profiles are kept. None of the accounts will be deactivated from the Mendix Platform. That should be done by a [Mendix Admin](/control-center/members/).
{{% /alert %}}

#### 10.1.3 Merge Result {#merge-profile-result}

The result of the profile merge process is that the information of the profiles is merged into one profile. The information that can be added to the profile will be associated with the resulting Mendix Profile. However, in a situation where there is conflicting data for the two profiles to be merged, the system uses the profile data of the user account you are signed in with. 

The following details may have conflicts, but these can easily be updated after the merge process: 

* Avatar image
* **Name**
* **Job Title**
* **Country of Residence**
* **About You**
* **Twitter URL**
* **LinkedIn URL**

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
It is not possible to separate profiles after they have been merged. Double-check that the information from all of your profiles is valid.
{{% /alert %}}

### 10.2 Accounts

This page is an overview of all the accounts you own and that are linked to your Mendix Profile. You can see which account you are logged in with, the company associated with each user account, if single sign-on is enabled, and the status of each user account (**Active** or **Deactivated**).

By default, you are requested to change your password every 90 days. A Mendix Admin can change this password policy setting in [Control Center](/control-center/security/).

You can update the password of your logged-in account via the [Change Password](https://login.mendix.com/mxid3/request-password-reset) button that is available by clicking the menu button (**...**) of the logged-in account. You can also reach this screen using the **Forgot password?** link on the login screen.

If you do not want to use an account anymore, you can remove it from this page. Click the menu button (**...**) for the logged-in account and select **Delete this account**. All of the account information is then removed and deleted from Mendix's servers. All the personal and identifiable information of your profile is deleted when you delete all of your accounts. 

You can only remove the account with which you are logged in. If you do not have access to your account anymore, please reach out to [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us) to delete your account.

#### 10.2.1 Creating an Account

If you already have a profile and want to add a new account to this profile, you can create the new account on your profile's **Accounts** overview. This action combines signing up for a new Mendix Platform account and [merging your profiles](#merging-profiles). After succesfully completing the flow, the new account appears in the **Accounts** overview.

Follow these steps to add a new account to your Mendix Pofile:

1. Click **Create Account**.
2. In the dialog box that appears, enter the email address of the account you want to create, then click **Next**.
3. In the next dialog box, enter a secure **Password** and indicate whether you want to receive Marketing communications from Mendix on this account. Then click **Next**.
4. Enter the verification code you receive via the selected email address.
5. Click **Verify**. You will see a loader while your account is created in the background.
6. If all went well, the new account is visible in the list of accounts that are part of your Mendix Profile!

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
This feature is not available if your company has enabled single sign-on. If this is the case, you have to follow the regular sign up process and then [merge the new account to your profile](#merging-profiles) when the sign-up is completed.
{{% /alert %}}

### 10.3 Notification Settings {#notifications}

On this page, you can configure how you want to be notified of Mendix Platform activity.

When you click **Configure Watched Apps** at the bottom of the page, you can choose to **Stop Watching** an app. To watch an app again, return to [My Apps](/developerportal/#my-apps).

You can also configure your **Buzz Notifications**:

* **Receive daily digest** – disabled by default
* **Receive updates for Buzz threads in which I am active** – enabled by default

### 10.4 Developer Settings {#dev-settings}

#### 10.4.1 API Keys {#profile-api-keys}

In this section, you can create and view the API keys that external applications can use to connect via the [Mendix Platform APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/) on behalf of your user account. An API key created here allows the apps using it to act on behalf of the user who created the key. This means the apps will have the same privileges as the user who created the key. An API key allows you to execute operations that need authentication without a password. For example, you can use an API key to perform scripted operations on your application model with the SDK. 

To get a Mendix API key, click **Configure API Keys** > **Create New API Key** and follow the instructions.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Make a note of the API key, as it will only be shown once. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/api-key.png" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
We may cache your API key. This means that when you revoke an API key, it may take some time before the change takes effect.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information, see the following:

* [Authentication](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/authentication/)
* [APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/)
* [Mendix Platform SDK](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/)
* [How to Manage App API Keys](/developerportal/settings/api-key/)

#### 10.4.2 Personal Access Tokens {#pat}

Some platform APIs use personal access tokens (PATs) rather than API keys. This sections explains the concept of PATs, how you can obtain one, and how you can use this security token to give an application access to Mendix Platform services on your behalf.

PATs are used as alternatives to passwords. They are designed to be used when the client application needs to get access on behalf of a specific platform user, but the user is not "present" at the time of access, so the user cannot login via a browser (web SSO). The client application can be any application (meaning, even an app not built with Mendix).

You can create a PAT and remain in control of what access is delegated via the PAT by selecting the scopes. The PAT itself is a "bearer" token, which means that anyone or anything that has access to the PAT can use it as if they were the associated platform user subject to the restrictions set up in the scope of the PAT.

PATs are security tokens that do not expire, but they cannot be used if the associated user has been deactivated on the Mendix Platform or when the user has deleted the PAT.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
From a governance aspect, it is important for Mendix Admins to deactivate ex-employees in the Mendix Platform. This will prevent those leavers from logging into the platform, and it also blocks the delegated access via PATs. This recommendation applies both when users use Mendix credentials, and when users use SSO with authentication provided by their corporate IDP (BYOIDP).
{{% /alert %}}

The following Mendix services support usage of PATs:

* [Catalog API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/catalog-apis/)
* [App Repository API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/app-repository-api/)
* [Projects API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/projects-api/)

##### 10.4.2.1 Creating a PAT {#create-pat}

When you click **New Token**, you need to set the following characteristics of the PAT:

* **Name** – give the PAT a name that reflects where or why you intend to use it
* **Defined Scopes** – the scopes (authorizations) that you want to delegate to your PAT

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/create-pat.png" width="500px" alt="Dialog box for defining the PAT scopes" >}}

Details about the scopes can be found in the documentation for specific services.

After you click **Create**, a pop-up window shows your secret token, which is the PAT. You must copy the secret token via **Copy Token**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/token-secret.png" width="500px" alt="Created PAT in pop-up window" >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Store the secret token in a safe location, because it will not be displayed again!
{{% /alert %}}

##### 10.4.2.2 Managing a PAT

To see the scopes of a PAT you have created, click **View Details**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/manage-pat.png" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You cannot see the secret token of a PAT here. You can only see that the PAT exists along with its scopes. 
{{% /alert %}}

You can delete a PAT you have created via **Delete**. This will prevent anyone who has obtained the PAT's secret token from successfully using it.

##### 10.4.2.3 Using a PAT

Use of a PAT depends on the API you are accessing.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
For security reasons, you should not include PATs into your source code.
{{% /alert %}}

To use a PAT with the [Catalog APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/catalog-apis/), it must be passed as the authorization header on every request made to the Catalog. The request will look like this:

```http
GET /v1/register HTTP/1.1
Host: catalog.mendix.com
Authorization: mxtoken <your personal access token>
```

If the PAT is not valid, the response will be `HTTP 403 Access Denied`:

```http
403 Access Denied
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "error": ""
}
```

For information on other PAT usages, see the [App Repository API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/app-repository-api/) and [Projects API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/projects-api/).

### 10.5 Personal Data

The Mendix Platform stores certain personal information about you. You can view this information by clicking  **Download Personal Data**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Mendix has been tracking these data changes since November 2018.
{{% /alert %}}

## 11 Point Penalties

Abusing the Mendix Forum, point system, or other community tools is not allowed. Any such action can result in a point penalty. Mendix reserves the right to penalize a user who bypasses or games the system without informing them.
