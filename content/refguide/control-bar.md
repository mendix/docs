## 1 Introduction

The control bar of the template grid, data grid, and reference set selector allows you to manipulate the objects displayed by means of buttons. By default, both grids will be created with a new, edit, and delete button in the control bar. The control bar can also include a number of selection options and spreadsheet export buttons, as well as microflow buttons for custom actions.
