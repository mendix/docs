## 1 Introduction

The image widget can be used to show a static image on a page, layout, or snippet.

For example, you can configure an image clicking which a page with customer details opens:

![Image Example](attachments/common-widgets/image-example.png)

{{% alert type="info" %}}

If you want to dynamically show different images based on data, you need to add [image viewer](image-viewer) on your page.

{{% /alert %}}
