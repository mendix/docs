## Purpose of This Guide

This guide presents the main Mendix product names, other Mendix terms, and partner terms currently being used in the Mendix Platform UI, the [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/), and the [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/). 

The purpose of this guide is to provide guidelines on usage, capitalization, and spelling as well as notes on important details and [terminology history](terminology-history) where necessary. Accordingly, if there are no specific usage guidelines or decisions on product terms (at least not yet), they are generally not included here.

In addition, terms included here should appear in the Mendix Documentation, Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide, or the Mendix Platform UI. If a term does not appear in one of these locations, it may be an internal-only term (for example, technical or generic terms only used on R&D teams), it may be outdated (meaning, usage of the term has been decided against), or it should not be used in customer-facing resources. In that case, company-wide consensus on the term does not need to be a goal, and thus the term does not need to be included here.

The purpose of this guide is not to provide a definition for each term. Terminology details are only given here for clarification where necessary. Product definitions are found throughout the [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/) and [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/), and for the sake of maintenance, they are not duplicated here.
