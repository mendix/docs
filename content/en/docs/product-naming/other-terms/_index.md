## Introduction

This document contains various Mendix terms that are used in the product UI and documentation.

### Under Each Term

Details and cross-references where necessary.

Guidelines for usage.

{{% alert color="success" %}}
Example usage.
{{% /alert %}}

## A-K

### application & app {#app}

An "application" or "app" can be one of the following:

* A local application
* A [Free App](#free-app)
* A licensed application hosted on the Mendix Cloud; another cloud such as AWS, SAP Cloud, or IBM Cloud Portal; or on the user's own server

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Do not capitalize (meaning, do not write "Mendix App").<br />
<br />
Do not replace with "app project" (or "project") generically, even when referring to project management-like tasks. **Project** is still used in some UI text, but that usage is being phased out. Using  "app" in all instances is prioritized.<br />
<br />
The full word "application" has a more well-rounded meaning to it (as in, web and mobile apps), whereas "app" may suggest just mobile apps to the reader. Accordingly, it can be better to use "application" at the beginning of documents and then switch to "app" later on. We want to make it clear that Mendix is not just for building mobile apps, but all kinds of applications.

### App ID

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Always capitalize.
{{% /alert %}}

### app team

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Does not need to be capitalized, and "team" should be used without the qualifier "app" where possible.
{{% /alert %}}

### app template {#app-template}

This is the term to use to reflect the create-new-app flow UI in the Developer Portal.

There are two inconsistencies in other areas of the platform UI:

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Do not use "starter app."
{{% /alert %}}

### App User

For a definition of this term, see the [Managing App Users](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#managing-app-users) section of the *Developer Portal Guide*.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Atlas UI {#atlas-ui}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.<br />
<br />
Do not use just "Atlas."
{{% /alert %}}

### Build Server

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances (to parallel "Team Server" and "Model Server").
{{% /alert %}}

### Business Engineer

This is a team role. As such, it differs from the term "business developer," which is used in the Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide as a generic role and persona term.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Buzz

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Use "Buzz" on its own, unless you need to specify "Company Buzz" or "App Buzz" for context.<br />
<br />
Do not use "the Buzz" (unless the context demands it).
{{% /alert %}}

### Company Contact

{{% alert color="info" %}}

### Deployment Package Repository

{{% alert color="info" %}}

{{% /alert %}}

### fast deploy & fast deployment

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Do not use "insta-deploy" or "instant redeploy."
{{% /alert %}}

### Free App {#free-app}

A [Free App](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#free-app) is an app that can be deployed to the Mendix Cloud without purchasing a specific license and is therefore free. There are restrictions on the resources available to a Free App. A Free App environment is a cloud environment, but it does not support complex or large applications. Free Apps are part of the [Free Edition](#free-edition).

This is different from an *Unlicensed App* which is an app deployed to an unlicensed environment on another cloud platform, such as SAP or Private Cloud.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.<br />
<br />
Do not use "Sandbox." For more information, see [Terminology History](/product-naming/terminology-history/).
{{% /alert %}}

### Free Edition {#free-edition}

This is the package of offerings that users can employ without requiring a paid license.

"Free Edition" replaced [Community Edition](/product-naming/terminology-history/#community-edition) in 2015, and was made a focus of the announcements at [Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Use to refer to the whole package of Mendix free offerings (Studio Pro, Studio, and Free Apps), not individual parts of the offering.<br />
<br />
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### guided product introduction tour

This describes the user guidance that is built into Mendix Studio. This is a generic term, so it can be applied as more user guidance is built.

It should be qualified by the context/location. In the case of Studio, the generic term is qualified by the context/location in the [Studio Release Notes](/releasenotes/studio/) like this: "A guided product introduction tour is now shown when you select **Start Your First App** from the **Introduction Tour** category when creating an app in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/)."

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Do not capitalize.
{{% /alert %}}

## L-N

{{% /alert %}}

### MTS (Medium-Term Support)

{{% alert color="info" %}}

### Mendix mobile app {#mendix-mobile-app}

[Mendix](/refguide8/getting-the-mendix-app/) is the name for the mobile app available for developers to test hybrid mobile apps.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This term replaces "Mendix Developer app" and "Mendix Mobile app" (which are not to be used in the product UI or documentation – for more information, see [Terminology History](/product-naming/terminology-history/)).<br />
