##Release notes PS 8.0

###New Features:

- View App and Edit App buttons. View App brings you to the deployment URL of your Free App; or, if you have Test, Acceptance and Production environments, lets you choose between these environments using a dropdown menu.
The Edit App button will launch the Desktop Modeler if you have it installed; if you are part of the partner group that tests the Web Modeler then you'll have the choice to directly open your app in the WM here.
- Redesigned interface. The new look sports light colors and a responsive layout. Menu items pertaining to your apps are moved from the top to the left-hand side. Users with permissions to access restricted parts of the Portal can navigate there using the Profile menu which opens when they click their avatar on the top right.
- Breadcrumbs. A header on top of the Development Portal will show you where you are in the navigation structure of the Portal.
- The Feedback widget can now be used when opened on small screen sizes (e.g. smartphone).
- The Guidance sidebar has been replaced by the Intercom widget.

###Bug fixes:
- The password reset form would give an error if you tried to submit it using the Enter key (even though you would receive a link).
- After creating a new app, the Team overview would flicker every few seconds.
- When writing a large post on the buzz, the screen would start jumping at every keypress.
