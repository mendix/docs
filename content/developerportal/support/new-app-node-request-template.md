## 1 Requesting a New License

If you want to deploy your app to a new licensed node in the Mendix Cloud or on-premises/virtual private cloud, you can request one from Mendix Support.

Fill in all the required details for this new licensed app node in the [Request New App Node](https://newnode.mendix.com/) app. This app replaces the *New App Node Request Template*.

Mendix Support will contact the [Technical Contact](../company-app-roles/technical-contact) for the app via a ticket in the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com), and provide the app details. Mendix Support will also check if your request matches your entitlement to resources (number of apps, cloud resources).

If you need a **Subscription Secret** for your app deployed to SAP, please submit a request with [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com).
