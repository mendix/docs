A Mendix hybrid application is a hybrid of a web and native app. If you want to publish your hybrid app on the Apple App Store or Google Play, you have to wrap your app in a native shell. Mendix uses Cordova to make hybrid apps. 

Once you are ready to distribute your app to test users or publish it on an app store, you need to package your app into a native app. For instructions on how to do this, see [How to Build a Mendix Hybrid App Locally](/howto8/mobile/build-hybrid-locally/).
