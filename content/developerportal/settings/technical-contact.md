## 1 Introduction

A Mendix application will always be set up and delivered with a technical contact connected to it. The assignment of the Technical Contact takes place when the order is signed. The Technical Contact is responsible for a Mendix application on a technical level. The technical contact needs a *MendixID* before Mendix can deliver the app. You get a MendixID when you create a Mendix account.

It is currently not possible to select more than one Technical Contact in the Mendix Cloud. See how to [Change the Technical Contact](/developerportal/howto/change-roles).
For On-Premises installations it is possible to select more than one contact. Contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com) with your request.

This document describes the role of the technical contact within the Mendix application domain.

## 2 Technical Contact Responsibilities

The responsibilities depend on the type of hosting for your app: On-Premises or Mendix Cloud.

### 2.1 On-Premises (The Mendix App Runs on the Customer's Own Infrastructure)

Managing licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix will send license renewal notifications to the technical contact via email
* If the technical contact would like to expand the license (e.g. more users), they need to contact their Account Executive

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes and incidents.

### 2.2 Mendix Cloud

You are the first point of contact for the app:

*   You will receive notifications for maintenance from Mendix Support
*   You will be able to receive alerts from the Mendix application when problems arise (CPU Load is high/running out of disk space)
*   You can configure the alert settings in the Monitoring tab of the cloud node.
*   If problems arise (for example, when the app is down)


You can manage the Mendix application in the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com):

* Deploy the model
* stop/start the app
* monitor the app
* connect an app to the node
* check log files
* manage the access rights of team members - the Technical Contact can also provide access rights to project members so they can also perform the above tasks. For more information, see [Security - Node Permissions](/developerportal/settings/node-permissions).


Licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix is responsible for Mendix Cloud app renewals
* Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) if you want to expand the license

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes and incidents.
