## Introduction

Mendix offers Atlas UI, a cross-platform UI framework that gives teams the foundation they need to build engaging, high-quality experiences and brings UX, IT, and business together. See the [Atlas 3](https://atlas.mendix.com) site additional information on Atlas.

Atlas comes with a default design system which can be fully tailored and extended. New apps are based on this design system. For more information, see the [Atlas Design System](https://atlasdesignsystem.mendixcloud.com/) website.

The following how-tos are available here:

* [Get Started](/howto/front-end/get-started/) — Learn more about Atlas UI and get started on your first customizations.
* [Customize Styling](/howto/front-end/customize-styling-new/) — Customize your styling in deeper ways. Specifically, you will see how our progressive and web apps use SASS (SCSS) and our native mobile apps use JavaScript to create your app's styling.
* [Configure Module-Level Theme Settings](/howto/front-end/module-level-theme-settings/) — Use module-level theme settings to control theme system behavior. This allows you to control which elements your developers can and cannot use.
* [Create a Company Design System](/howto/front-end/create-a-company-design-system/) — Create a company design system: a "UI kit" which contains all the elements that a team needs to design, realize, and develop a product.
* [Extend Design Properties](/howto/front-end/extend-design-properties/) — Learn the basics of design properties and how to make your own.
