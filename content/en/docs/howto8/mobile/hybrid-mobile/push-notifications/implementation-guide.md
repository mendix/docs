## 1 Introduction

This how-to will walk you through the steps needed to implement push notifications in your application.

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Import the PushNotifications module
* Add the push notification widget and administrator pages
* Update several project files with the necessary dependencies
* Obtain FCM/APNs access/credentials and configure them with your application
* Build the hybrid mobile package

## 2 Importing the PushNotifications Module from the Marketplace

The [Push Notifications Connector](/appstore/modules/push-notifications/) module is published in the Mendix Marketplace. To import it into your project, click the Marketplace icon in the top right of Mendix Studio Pro. Search for "Push Notifications Connector" and click the title of the result:

{{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/hybrid-mobile/push-notifications/implementation-guide/20218020.png" >}}

On the resulting page, click the green **Download** button. Make sure that **Add as a new module** is selected, and then click **Import**:

The Push Notifications Connector assumes that the mobile app and the back-end part will reside in the same app.

## 3 Installing Module Dependencies

The PushNotifications module has the following dependencies:

* [Encryption](/appstore/modules/encryption/)
* [Community Commons Function Library](/appstore/modules/community-commons-function-library/)
* [Nanoflow Commons](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/109515/)
* [Native Mobile Resources](/appstore/modules/native-mobile-resources/)

To include these dependencies, download them from the Marketplace in a way similar to how you installed the PushNotifications module. While importing, you may get a pop-up window with information about overwriting project files, which you can confirm by clicking **OK**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

If your project is using an older version of the [Encryption](/appstore/modules/encryption/) module, it might trigger an error for referencing a non-existent layout. You can fix this by assigning the primary layout of the **Encryption.ResponsiveLayout_Certificate** layout to another layout (please note that in this specific use case, it is not important which layout is used). This does not apply to version 1.3.1 and above.

{{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/hybrid-mobile/push-notifications/implementation-guide/20217886.jpg" >}}

{{% /alert %}}

After importing the module and the dependencies, your error dock will inform you that entity access is out of date. To fix this error, double-click the error and then click **Update security** at the top of the domain model pane.

## 4 Including the Push Notifications Snippet in the Application's Layouts

To properly register your device with a third-party remote push service (FCM or APNs) and display in-app notifications, you should put the widget on the pages of your app. You can accomplish this by dragging the **Online_Snippet** or **Offline_Snippet** (located in the **_USE ME** folder in the **PushNotifications** module) into the layouts used by your app. Which of these two you should pick depends on whether your Mendix hybrid app uses an online profile or an offline profile. Note that push notifications do not currently work on the desktop.

If your app is offline-compatible, ensure that a sync button is available to the user so that device registration requests will be synchronized with the server. For more information, see [Offline](/refguide8/offline-first/) and [Navigation](/refguide8/navigation/#hybrid-profiles).

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

Please do not remove the button with the caption **Device Registration reference** from the **PushNotification_Snippet**. This is required to make the widget offline-compatible. Please note that this button is invisible to the user.

## 5 Starting Connectors from Your After-Startup Microflow

The PushNotifications module contains a microflow named **AfterStartup_PushNotifications** that will start the APNs connector for you. Call this microflow from your **AfterStartup** microflow.

If your project already has an AfterStartup microflow configured, it is recommended that you either: 

* create a new microflow, from which you will call both the existing AfterStartup microflow and the AfterStartup_PushNotifications microflow, and then set this as the AfterStartup microflow for your app
* add a new action to the existing AfterStartup microflow to run the AfterStartup_PushNotifications microflow

{{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/hybrid-mobile/push-notifications/implementation-guide/on-app-startup.png" alt="On start push microflow" >}}

## 6 Setting Up the Administration Pages {#setting}

Add the **PushNotifications_Administration** page to the project navigation, so it can be reached after you deploy your app. This page contains three tabs:

* **Pending Messages** – shows all the messages that are queued either because they were sent using the QueueMessage action or because previous attempts to send them failed
* **Devices** – contains a list of all the devices registered with the application and is useful for testing purposes
* **Configuration** – configures your application so that it can reach the respective services (APNs and FCM) later on

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

Do not add the administration pages to the navigation layout of offline devices. The administration pages are not offline-compatible.

## 7 Setting Up the Project Security for Your Module

On the **User roles** tab of the **Project Security** dialog box, include the following:

* The **PushNotifications.Administrator** role as part of the main **Administrator** role
* The **PushNotifications.User** role as part of the main **User** role
* The **PushNotifications.Anonymous** role role as part of the main **Anonymous** role (if your application allows anonymous users)

## 8 Deploying Your App

At this point, all the implementation steps are done and you can deploy your application to the Mendix Cloud. If you are using a Free App, simply click **Run**.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

Make sure that the `Encryption.EncryptionKey` constant has a value before you start the application. If the value is not set, you will get a NullPointerException when you try to send a notification to APNs. If you are using a Free App, set a default value for the constant in the model. Otherwise, configure the constant value in the Mendix Developer Portal.

## 9 Setting Up Access to APNs or FCM

Below are instructions for setting up access to APNs or FCM and configuring them in your application. We recommend starting with FCM, because it is significantly less complicated than setting up APNs. You can return to this section later to set up APNs.

Open your Mendix app, sign in as an **Admin**, and open the **PushNotifications_Administration** page. Scroll to the **FCM** section and create or edit a configuration. 

Configure FCM as follows:

1. Select the **Enabled** checkbox.
2. Enter a name for the new configuration.
3. Enter your Firebase project ID (located on the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) website).
4. Upload your private key (which you downloaded when you created a service account).

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Make sure the **Encryption.EncryptionKey** constant has a valid value before you start the application. If the value is not set, the private key will not be stored correctly and you will get a **NullPointerException** error when you try to send a notification to FCM. If you get the **NullPointerException** error, please double-check the value of the **Encryption.EncryptionKey** constant, restart your app, and upload the private key again.

## 10 Building the Hybrid Mobile Application

You now need to build the hybrid mobile application. For an explanation on how to do this, see [How to Publish a Mendix Hybrid Mobile App](/howto8/mobile/publishing-a-mendix-hybrid-mobile-app-in-mobile-app-stores/).
