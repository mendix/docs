## 1 Introduction

Grids show a list of objects and include a [data grid](/refguide/data-grid/) and a [template grid](/refguide/template-grid/). The main difference between these grids is the way the list of objects is displayed: a data grid shows it in columns, while a template grid shows it in tiles.

[Data grid 2](/appstore/modules/data-grid-2/) is a special type of grid, available as part of the [Data Widgets](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/116540) Marketplace module.

Grids have the following components in common:

* [Search bar](/refguide/search-bar/) –  allows end-users to search for objects in the grid 
* [Sort bar](/refguide/sort-bar/) –  allows end-users to sort items in the grid 
* [Control bar](/refguide/control-bar/) –  allows end-users to control the objects displayed in the grid by means of buttons
