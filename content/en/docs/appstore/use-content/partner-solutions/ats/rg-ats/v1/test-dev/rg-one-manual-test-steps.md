Manual test steps are the process to search and select required actions to manually create a test case in ATS. In this way the test case will be created by selecting the actions manually.

When you create a new test case it is empty and has no test steps assigned.

To add a new test step follow these steps:

* Click the *Add* button to open the *Test Step Setup* form.
* Under *1) Describe Test Step* you can enter a description of what you are doing in the test step.
* Under *2) Search Action* you can search for an existing action in the repository. A list of all available standard actions can be found in the next section. All of your custom created actions will also be listed here for easy reusability.
* After entering a search term, a list of found actions will show and you can see name and description of the actions
* Click an action to select it and click the *Save* button to add a new test step that uses the action.

You can now select the created test step and edit its parameters under the *Test Step Settings* to the right.
