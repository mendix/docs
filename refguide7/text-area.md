This text area allows the end-user to set the description of the product.

A text area must be placed in a data view or template grid and connected to an attribute of type String. The connected attribute is shown in blue and between brackets inside the text area.

## General properties

### Grow automatically

This property defines whether the text area grows automatically depending on the amount of text in it.
