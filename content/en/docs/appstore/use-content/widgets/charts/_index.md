## Common Chart Properties

### Data Source

#### Series

The **Series** property makes it easy to configure, control, and modify a chart series:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/data-source-example.png" width="450px" class="no-border" >}}

You do not need to put a chart into a data view to feed data into a widget. When you click the **New** button on a series panel, the **Edit Series** dialog box will be shown:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/series-item-example.png" width="450px" class="no-border" >}}

In this dialog box you will find these properties:

* **Data set**
    * **Single** – This represents controls for a single set of dates. This is good option to start with, as you can have multiple **Single** series. 
    * **Multiple** – This is useful if you have a more complex data model or a microflow which could be used as data source for your chart. In this case you must specify which attribute to use as the **Series name**, otherwise your widget will be unable to visualize your data correctly.
* **Data source** – This property controls your data set's type and source. If you click **Edit** you will see a **Data source edit** dialog box where you specify the data series retrieval location.
* **Group by** – This is the attribute used to split items into groups (visible only when **Data set** is set to **Multiple**).
* **Series name** – This property controls the legend of a data series.
* **X axis attribute** – This is the attribute used to get a value for the X axis (visible only when **Data source** is set).
* **Y axis attribute** – This is the attribute used to get a value for the Y axis (visible only when **Data source** is set).
* **Aggregation function** – This attribute defines how data is aggregated when multiple Y values are available for a single X value.
* **Tooltip hover text** – This is the text template used to customize the message shown to user upon a cursor hovering over the series.

Beside the **General** tab you will find 3 more tabs in the **Edit Series** dialog box:

* **Appearance** – This lists properties which allow you to modify styling for the current data series. In most cases there will be color properties.
* **Events** – This lists possible event triggers.
* **Advanced** – This uses one field which will hold a JSON object with advanced configuration for this data series.

### General

#### Enable Developer Mode

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
All changes made in the developer editor are temporary. To save your progress, copy the settings from the **Custom settings** area to the **Chart settings** in Studio Pro.
{{% /alert %}}

When set to **Yes** this property enables **Developer mode** for the selected chart. After enabling **Developer mode** you will see a **Toggle Editor** button. When clicked, this button opens the **Chart settings** panel:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/toggle-editor-button.png" width="350px" alt="Toggle Editor button in top right corner of the chart widget." class="no-border" >}}

This developer mode panel is a live settings editor, meaning that your changes will be instantly applied to the current chart.

At the top of the panel there is a drop-down list which shows the currently selected settings group. By default each chart has a **Layout** group and **Configuration** group—these groups control chart and layout settings. Also, in this drop-down list you will find named groups that allow you to configure chart settings per series:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/charts-dev-panel.png" width="350px" alt="Panel with dropdown on top and textarea below. Textarea content is a JSON object." class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}} 
To see available options and useful examples, see Plotly's [JavaScript Figure Reference](https://plotly.com/javascript/reference/index/) guide. 
{{% /alert %}}

#### Show Legend

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/chart-with-legend.png" width="450px" alt="Column chart. The legend list on right side is highlighted with red square." class="no-border" >}}

This setting controls the visibility of a chart's legend block (highlighted in the picture above). If set to **no**, then the legend block is hidden.

#### X Axis Label and Y Axis Label

These two properties control labels for the X and Y axis respectively.

#### Grid Lines

This property controls horizontal and vertical rulers of the chart:

* **None** – No rulers are visible.
* **Horizontal** – Only a horizontal ruler is visible.
* **Vertical** – Only a vertical ruler is visible.
* **Both** – Both types of rulers are visible.

## Dimensions

### Width Unit

This property controls the unit measuring the widget (it can be **percentage** or **pixels**).

### Width

This property controls width of the widget.

### Height Unit

This property controls the unit for measuring widget height:

* **Percentage of width** – Height is measured relative to widget width (use this mode to keep width and height in aspect ratio).
* **Pixels** – This uses pixels as height unit (a good option for most cases).
* **Percentage of parent** – Height is measured relative to a parent **height** property (only works when parent has **height** CSS property).

### Height

This property controls height of the widget.

## Advanced

### Enable Theme Folder Config

If set to **Yes** this widget will try to load global chart settings specified in the *theme/web/com.mendix.charts.json* file. Before using this feature make sure this file is present in your app.

## Legacy Chart Widget Documentation {#legacy-widget-docs}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
This widget is experiencing rendering issues in Studio Pro's **Design mode**. The behavior is under investigation.
{{% /alert %}}

### Introduction

The [Charts](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/105695/) widget enables plotting and comparing your data across different charts.

These are the available charts:

* Column chart
* Line chart
* Pie chart
* Area chart
* Bar chart
* Time series chart
* Heat chart
* Bubble chart

### Basic Configuration

#### Line Chart {#line-chart}

A **Line chart** (scatter chart) should have one or more series, each displaying commonly grouped data points.

A series' data can be retrieved from the database, by a microflow, or from a REST endpoint:

1. Place the widget in a page within the context of an entity.
2. Select the either **Static** or **Dynamic** for the **Series**.
3. Select a **Data entity** for the chart values.
4. Select the **Data source**:
    * If the **Data source** selected is **Database**, optionally change the **XPath constraint**
    * If the **Data source** selected is **Microflow,** select a **Microflow** that returns the series values
    * If the **Data source** selected is **REST endpoint**, enter the **REST URL**
5. If you set a **Dynamic** series, this will retrieve all the chart series in one configuration. Add configurations for them on the **Dynamic series** tab.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The line chart's X-axis provides support for dates, and thus the line chart can be configured as a [time series chart](#time-series).
{{% /alert %}}

#### Area Chart

The **Area chart** has data properties identical to those of the [Line chart](#line-chart).

#### Column Chart {#column-chart}

The **Column chart** has data properties identical to those of the [Line chart](#line-chart). However, there is no support for the **Date and time** data type.

#### Bar Chart

The **Bar chart** has data properties identical to those of the [Column chart](#column-chart). 

#### Pie Chart {#pie-chart}

Unlike the chart types above, the **Pie chart** requires no series. 

These are the properties for configuring Pie chart data:

* **Data source** tab
    * **Entity** (required) – the entity from which the data values will be retrieved
* **Data points** tab
    * **Name attribute** (required) – the attribute that contains the data point captions
    * **Value attribute** (required) – the attribute that contains the data point values
    * **Color attribute** (required) – the attribute that contains the data point colors
    * **Sort attribute** – the attribute to use for sorting the X-axis data

#### Time Series Chart {#time-series}

The **Time series chart** is a specialised version of the [Line chart](#line-chart), focusing on the X-axis dates. Therefore, it has data properties identical to those of the line chart.

#### Heat Map

The **Heat map** should be configured with required horizontal, vertical, and data attributes.

The sample domain model could be either of the two configurations below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/charts/heat-map.png" class="no-border" >}}

#### Bubble chart

The **Bubble chart** has data properties identical to those of the [Line chart](#line-chart). However, the **Bubble size data** attribute is required, as it contains and determines the size of the bubble.

### Advanced Configuration

The charts in this widget are based on the [mendixlabs/charts](https://github.com/mendixlabs/charts/issues) library. As such, the widget provides support for advanced users to extend or overwrite the basic settings by adding the chart properties as JSON.

To enable this feature, go to the **Mode** option in the **Advanced** properties tab. For the [Line chart](#line-chart) and [Column chart](#column-chart), each series has its own **Advanced** tab for specialized configurations.

The available advanced options and their usage are described below.

#### Layout Options for All Charts

The layout options control the general appearance of a chart. Common options include `title`, `showlegend`, `xaxis`, and `yaxis`. 

```json
{
  "showlegend": true,
  "legend": {
    "orientation": "h",
    "y": "auto"
  }
}
```

#### Configurations Options for All Charts

Configuration options control the appearance of a chart beyond the layout options. Common options include `displayModeBar` and `doubleClick`.

```json
{
  "displayModeBar": true,
  "doubleClick": true,
  "displaylogo": false
}
```

For more details, see the [Advanced Configuration Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mendixlabs/charts/v1.4.4/AdvancedCheatSheet.md).

#### Data Options for the Pie Chart

On the [Pie chart](#pie-chart), the data options control the appearance of the pie circle beyond the general layout options. Options include `hole`, `name`, and `marker`.

```json
{
  "hole": 0.5
}
```

For more details, see the [Advanced Configuration Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mendixlabs/charts/v1.4.4/AdvancedCheatSheet.md).

#### Series Options for the Line and Column Charts

The series options control the appearance of a specific series on the [Line chart](#line-chart) and [Column chart](#column-chart). Options include `line color` and `line shape`.

For the full Plotly API reference, see [JavaScript Figure Reference](https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/).

#### Theme-Based Advanced Configuration

The settings above can also be added in a global context via the **theme** folder of your Mendix app root directory.

Add a *.json* file named *com.mendix.charts* to the **theme** folder. The JSON should be in the following format:

```json
{
  "layout": {
    // Add shared layout options here (for all charts)
  },
  "configuration": {
    // Add shared configuration options here (for all charts)
  },
  "charts": {
    "LineChart": {
      "layout": {
        // Add line chart only layout options here
      },
      "data": {
        // Add line chart only data options here
      },
      "configuration": {
          // Add line chart only configuration options here
      }
    },
    "AreaChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "BubbleChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "TimeSeries": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "ColumnChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "BarChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "PieChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "HeatMap": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    }
  }
}
```

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Use this with caution, as the configs set up here shall be applied to every instance of the charts in your application. Only the advanced configurations set up in the widget itself have a higher precedence.
