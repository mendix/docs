## 1 Introduction

Now that you have implemented the prerequisites in your app, you must implement the [Push Notifications Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/3003) module. Complete the steps below to enable the basic configuration.

## 2 Download From Marketplace

If you have not done so, make sure to download the **Push Notification Connector** module from the Marketplace:

1. Open up the Marketplace from Studio Pro.
1. Search for *Push Notification Connector*.
1. Open the **Push Notification Connector** module.
1. Click **Download**.

## 3 Configure Your App {#config}

In order for your app to use to use the Push Connections Module, configure the following things:

1. Open **Project** > **Security** in the App Explorer.
1. Go to **User roles**.<br />
1. Adjust the user roles that should have access to the push notifications:<br />
	a. The `Administrator` module role should be assigned to at least one user executing configuration and administrative tasks. <br />
	b. The `Anonymous` module role may be assigned to your anonymous project user role. <br />
	c. The `User` role is for any user role that needs to interact with notifications without being an `Administrator` or `Anonymous` user.
1. Save the Security settings.
1. Open up **Project** > **Navigation** in the App Explorer.
1. Add a new open page navigation item to the **Responsive** navigation profile.
1. Select the **Administration** page from the **PushNotifications** module. This page is located in the **_USE ME/Web** folder of the **PushNotifications** module.
1. Add a microflow sub-call to your **Afterstartup** microflow for the microflow **AfterStartup_PushNotifications**:<br />
	a. If you do not have an **Afterstartup** microflow configured yet, read the [After Startup](/refguide/project-settings/#after-startup) section of *App Settings* for more information.

Now you are able to start your app and move on to the next step: [Set Up the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging Server](/howto8/mobile/setting-up-google-firebase-cloud-messaging-server/).
