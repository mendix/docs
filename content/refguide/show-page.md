![](attachments/client-activities/show-page-properties.png)

The **Show page** properties pane consists of the following sections:

* [Action](#action)
* [Common](#common)

## 3 Action Section {#action}

The **Action** section of the properties pane shows the action associated with this activity.

You can open a dialog box to configure this action by clicking the ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to the action.

You can also open the dialog box by double-clicking the activity in the microflow or right-clicking the activity and selecting **Properties**.

### 3.1 Object to Pass {#object-to-pass}

An object that will be passed to the page that is opened. This object will be used by [data views](data-view) with a page parameter data source.

### 3.2 Page

The [page](page) that is displayed to an end-user. If the [Object to pass](#object-to-pass) property is specified, the page must contain a data view connected to the same entity as the passed object (or its generalization).

To create a new page that **Show page** activity will show, click the **Select** button > **New**. If you have selected an **Object to pass**, Studio Pro will automatically create a data view to edit that object.

### 3.3 Page Title

By default the title of the page is determined by the page title property of the page. You can replace this title with a custom title if necessary.

This feature allows you to re-use the same page for the **New** and **Edit** buttons of a [data grid](data-grid). By simply setting the titles to, for example, *New Customer* and *Edit Customer*, you can save yourself the trouble of duplicating pages.
