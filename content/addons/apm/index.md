## 1 Introduction

Development teams can use the Mendix Application Performance Monitor (APM) to continuously monitor and measure performance of their apps in order to diagnose and resolve performance issues. Mendix APM provides point-in-time visibility, tracking, and diagnostics into Mendix Runtime performance at both a high level for user experience performance and at the lowest possible level for details on microflow activity performance. This allows you to continuously improve your app’s performance and user experience.

Mendix APM provides this experience through the following tools:

* Trap Tool – continuously records all levels of logging and stores it when an error occurs
* Statistics Tool – identifies trends by gathering statistics on application performance
* Performance Tool – analyzes individual functions and visualizes where improvement is possible
* Measurements Tool – monitors the CPU and memory, performs measuring queries, and alerts if a limit is exceeded
