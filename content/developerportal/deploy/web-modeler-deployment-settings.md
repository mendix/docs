## 1 Introduction

If you have a licensed app, you need to select an environment for the Web Modeler separately. For more information on licensed apps and environments, see [Mendix Cloud](mendix-cloud-deploy) and [Environments](environments).

By default the environment is not selected for the Web Modeler. Thus, when you try to publish, you will get a warning message. For more information, see [Deploying Your App From the Web Modeler](/refguide/web-modeler/deployment-wm) in the *Web Modeler* category.
