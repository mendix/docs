## 2018

### January 29th, 2018 16:10:52 GMT

#### Improvements

* In the page editor, you can now configure the page size of list views by changing the value of the **Page Size** property. The WYSIWYG editor will instantly render the number of rows you entered.
* When you create a page from an entity context that contains an Atlas UI data view, you will now see a new check box in the **Create new page** wizard: **Pre-fill page contents based on the `<name>` entity**. When you check this box, page content will pre-fill automatically. This speeds up initial app development by automagically adding and wiring the appropriate widgets for the entity specified.
* When using exclusive splits in the microflow editor, we now auto-configure the last split condition of an exclusive split. This will save you time and keep you from unintentionally omitting that condition.
* You can now easily jump to the microflow that serves as the data source for your data widget by clicking the arrow icon that is located right next to the **Data Source** property.
* We added support for [Desktop Modeler 7.11.0](../desktop-modeler/7.11). The minimum (and only) supported version is now Desktop Modeler 7.11.0.

## 2017

### December 18th, 2017 10:43:36 GMT

#### Improvements

* You can now use the radio buttons widget in the page editor.
* For an **Exclusive Split**, you can now configure split cases using the **Add case** button in the **Properties** pane of the microflow editor.
* We added a progress bar to the steps in the guided product introduction tour that is available when you select **Start Your First App** when creating an app in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/).
* We added support for the forthcoming release of Mendix 7.10.

#### Fixes

### December 1st, 2017 09:53:20 GMT

#### Improvements

* We introduced a help menu and improved the dialog box for syncing with the Desktop Modeler.

* You are now able to configure **Close Page** and **Show Home Page** activities in the microflow editor.
* Your SCSS is no longer compiled to CSS when opening the Web Modeler, so you won't have styling changes when you sync with the Desktop Modeler without having changed any styling in the Web Modeler.

### November 20th, 2017

#### Improvements

* You are now able to configure splits with enumerations in the microflow editor. This adds a host of opportunities for adding logic to your app!

### November 14th, 2017

#### Improvements

#### Improvements

* We improved the text of the guided product introduction tour.

* Along with all of its button cousins, we now support the creation and configuration of link buttons. You can find the new **Open Link** button in your **Toolbox**. An old favorite from the Desktop Modeler, link buttons allow you to, for example, redirect the browser to a new page, an email form, or the call/messaging apps on your phone.
* We added support for [Desktop Modeler 7.7.1](../desktop-modeler/7.7)

#### Fixes

* We fixed the problem that prevented configuring an add-on widget when one of its properties used a relative path in its `entityProperty` configuration.

### September 5th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Entity access will no longer be out of date when adding or removing attributes, associations, and entities, so you won't need to go to the Desktop Modeler anymore to fix this problem. Deployment in the Web Modeler will succeed after the aforementioned actions.
* We improved the publish-application flow by updating some messages in the **Publish** dialog box.
* Menu bars and navigation trees configured with a custom menu document are now displayed.

### August 28th, 2017

* We implemented basic keyboard support for the modal dialog boxes. You can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to jump to the next input field or button inside a modal dialog box. You can also use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the dialog box.
