Welcome to the Mendix 4 how-to section. Here you will find short step-by-step guides to help you with some of the more challenging aspects of the Mendix Framework. Should you be looking for in-depth descriptions of the various aspects of the Mendix technology, you can find these in the [reference guide](/refguide4/).

**Project Settings**

These articles help you configure settings that affect your entire project, as well as the navigation of your application.

**Domain Model**

The domain model is a central part of any application, as it defines both the entities the project uses and their interrelationships.
