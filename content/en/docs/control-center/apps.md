## 8 Viewing App Details {#app-details}

If you click an app name on a tab, a page opens and shows the details of this app.

The app details page has the following tabs:

* **App Info** – This tab has the **Description** and **App ID** fields, which are also available on the [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page for your app in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/).
* **Members** – This tab presents the team members in the app development team.
    * You can directly deactivate a team member from the app by clicking their name and selecting **Deactivate Member**.
    * For other member management options, click **Manage Members**, which will open the [Team](/developerportal/general/team/#managing) page of the app. As a Mendix Admin, you can also add yourself to a team via this page.
* **Environments** – This tab shows all Mendix Cloud environments. For the free Mendix Cloud environment, you can delete the environment on this tab. Once the free environment is deleted, all data will be removed. However, the app team members can still access the associated app repository in the Mendix Portal.
* **App Roles** – This tab presents the app team roles defined via the **Default App Roles** feature on the [Roles & Permissions](/control-center/roles-and-permissions/) page.

If the app is not a licensed app, you can see the action menu ({{% icon name="three-dots-menu-horizontal" %}}) on the upper-right corner of the page. If the app is active, then you have the options to deactivate the app and delete the app; and if the app is deactivated, then you have the options to activate the app and delete the app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Deleting and deactivating apps is currently not supported for licensed apps or apps that are not running on Mendix Cloud. For the consequences of these operations, see the table in the [Deactivating and Deleting Apps](#deactivate-delete-apps) section.
