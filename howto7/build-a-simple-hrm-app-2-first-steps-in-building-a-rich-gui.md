## 1 Introduction

This how-to is based on the video "Build a Simple HRM App: the First Steps in Building a Rich GUI," which is part of the [Getting Started videos](http://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/courses/gettingstarted).

This is the second how-to in a series of five on how to create a simple human resource management (HRM) application. In this how-to, you will learn how to build pages to manage employees in your application.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* How to create a domain model
* How to build pages

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Use the first how-to in this series: [Build a Simple HRM App 1: Create, Manage, and Deploy the App](build-a-simple-hrm-app-1-create-manage-and-deploy-the-app)

## 3 Creating a Domain Model

The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. It is central to the architecture of your application. The domain model consists of entities and their relations represented by associations.

To create a domain model, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Domain Model** of the **MyFirstModule** module:

    For more information about entities, see [Entities](/refguide7/entities) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
3. Double-click the new entity:
