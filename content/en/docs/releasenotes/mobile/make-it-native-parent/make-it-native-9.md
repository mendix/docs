## Android 2.0.0 / iOS 2.0.0

**Release date: 28th March 2023**

### Improvements

* The Make It Native 9 app now uses React Native 0.70.7 to support Studio Pro [9.24.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.24/). This means it is no longer compatible with older Studio Pro versions. We recommend upgrading your app to 9.24 or building a [custom developer app](/refguide/mobile/distributing-mobile-apps/building-native-apps/how-to-devapps/). 

### Fixes 

* We fixed an issue with the QR Code scanner.

## Android 1.1.2 / iOS 1.1.1

**Release date: 16th August 2021**

### Improvements

* The Make It Native 9 app now uses React Native 0.64.2 to support Studio Pro 9.5.0.

### Fixes 

* The Take picture action should now work as expected.

## Android 1.1.0 / iOS 1.1.0

**Release date: 30th March 2021**

This is the official release of the Android and iOS versions of the Make It Native 9 app with support for Mendix Studio Pro 9.0. Both the Android and iOS versions allow you to preview and debug your locally-running native app on any [supported mobile platforms](/refguide/system-requirements/#mobileos).

## Android 1.0.5

**Release date: 11th May 2021**

### Improvements

* AR-specific device features are now *not* mandatory. We added a dialog box which notifies people using unsupported devices. The dialog box informs users that AR might not fully work on their specific device. The dialog box will also mention which specific device features prevent AR from working.
* Devices that do not comply with AR requirements will once again be able to download the [Make It Native 9](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendix.developerapp.mx9&hl=en_US&gl=US) app from the Google Play Store. However, Mendix 9 AR features might not be fully testable on such devices.

## Android 1.0.4 / iOS 1.0.2

**Release date: 30th March 2021**

This is the official release of the Android and iOS versions of the Make It Native 9 app, with support for Mendix Studio Pro 9.0. Both Android and iOS versions allow you to preview and debug your locally running native app on any supported mobile platform.
