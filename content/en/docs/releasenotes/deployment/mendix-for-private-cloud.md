To use Prometheus metrics, upgrade to Mendix Operator v2.1.0 (or above) and follow the [instructions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-monitor/).

### October 25th, 2021

#### mxpc-cli v2.1.2 for Mendix Operator v2.1.0 and Mendix Gateway Agent v2.1.0

* We have added support for configuring Ceph Object Storage as a storage type.
* We have added an option to prevent data deletion when using one of the storage plan types minio, amazon-s3, azure blob, google cloud, or ceph.

    The new option prevents files being deleted from storage when an environment is removed.

### October 14th, 2021

#### Portal Improvements

* We have replaced the Mendix 8 placeholder app which is deployed when you add a new environment with a Mendix 9 app. Use the Mendix 7 placeholder app if you are planning to  deploy a Mendix 7 or Mendix 8 app.

##### Known Issue{#2.1.0}

This issue is fixed in [version 2.1.1](#2.1.1) of `mxpc-cli`.

* Upgrading a namespace from operator v2.0.0 to v2.1.0 causes app deployments to have outdated labels or annotations that make your environments unreachable.  (Ticket 129150)

    To fix the issue, you must delete the app deployments using the following commands:

    ```
    kubectl delete deployment <app>-master -n <namespace>
    kubectl delete deployment <app>-worker -n <namespace>
    ```

  * Bash (or Git Bash) is no longer required to install and configure a cluster. This allows you to use the tool in most Windows terminals such as PowerShell and Windows Command prompt with no workarounds.
  * The installation process no longer needs to communicate with an external service to download installation resources, and only needs access to the Kubernetes cluster API.
  * Migration of Mendix components to a Private Cloud registry no longer requires downloading and patching the installation script.
  * The process for upgrading to the next version of Mendix for Private Cloud has been complely automated. Instead of a manual process using a Bash terminal, an upgrade can be done with a click of the mouse.
  * It's now possible to install or upgrade to a specific version of Mendix Operator (1.9.0 and later). Previously, it was only possible to install the latest version of the Operator.
* We have added reporting of the **Storage Provisioner Version** to the Private Cloud Portal.
* We have added dedicated sections to configure scheduled events and app constants when using the Operator in standalone mode.

To upgrade an existing installation of Private Cloud to this version, follow the [Upgrade instructions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-upgrade-guide/).

* The Private Cloud Portal now allows to download a version of the Configuration Tool that's compatible with the Mendix Operator installed in a cluster.
* We have fixed a UI layout issues that were sometimes visible when an environment failed to build a container image. (Ticket 114548)
* We have fixed an issue with the feedback widget duplicating itself.

#### Mendix Operator v1.8.0 and Mendix Gateway Agent v1.7.0

* We have improved dependency version management, so upgrading to future versions of the Mendix Operator will be easier.
* We have introduced versioning for all components, instead of using the "latest" version. All components are now tested for compatibility, and once the Mendix Operator is installed, its behavior will remain unchanged. Components can only be updated through a manual update process.
* We have added a feature to report installed component versions to the Private Cloud Portal. In the future, this will be used to indicate which Mendix for Private Cloud Operator version is installed and which features it supports.
* We have added a new S3 option, allowing the use of an existing IAM policy and S3 bucket. Each environment will still get its own account (AWS IAM user) and will not have access to files from other environments.
* We have improved the S3 storage configuration UI in the Configuration Tool.
* We have updated the Configuration Tool to run in fullscreen, so that it adapts better to smaller and larger screens.
* We have fixed an issue with misleading error messages in the container logs if Mendix Runtime is failing to start. If the MxAdmin user has an insecure password, a correct error message will be displayed.

To upgrade an existing installation of Private Cloud to this version, follow the [Upgrade instructions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-upgrade-guide/).
After upgrading the Mendix Operator, we recommend downloading the latest version of the Configuration Tool.

### January 6th, 2021

* We now add an environment UUID to environments deployed to Private Cloud namespaces so environment names no longer need to be unique.
* As part of a Developer Portal clean up, we removed the *Model* option from the *DEVELOP* section of the Developer Portal menu when you are looking at environments on Mendix for Private Cloud. The functions of this page are still available via the **Edit in Studio** and **Edit in Studio Pro** buttons on the environments page. 

#### Fixes

* We fixed the bug where you would be taken to a non-existent page and receive a *404 Not Found* message if you didn't select an Operating System when downloading the configuration tool.

### December 10th, 2020

#### Mendix for Private Cloud — Mendix Operator v1.7.0 and Mendix Gateway Agent v1.6.0

* We have added a configuration option to add custom Certificate Authorities which should be trusted by the Mendix Operator and app environments.
* We have added a Strict TLS mode to PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Minio, which will only allow connections to the database and file storage if there is a valid and trusted TLS certificate. Together with the custom Certificate Authorities option, this will ensure that Mendix apps are connecting to the database and file storage over a secured connection. Strict TLS mode should only be used with apps created in Mendix 8.15.2 (or later versions), earlier Mendix versions will fail to start when validating the TLS certificate.
* We have added an option to specify TLS client certificates in Mendix apps. A Mendix app can use a TLS client certificate when communicating with external web services.

To upgrade an existing installation of Private Cloud to this version, follow the [Upgrade instructions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-upgrade-guide/).

### November 16th, 2020

### September 14th, 2020

#### Fixes

* We resolved an issue where deployment of a new MDA to an environment set the constant values to the defaults in the MDA rather than applying the values set through the environment's [Model Options](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-deploy/#environment-details). (Ticket 106933)

### September 9th, 2020

#### Mendix Operator v1.5.0 and Mendix Gateway Agent v1.4.0

* We added an option to configure TLS options per environment, overriding the default namespace settings.
* OpenShift Routes now support all features which were previously only available in Ingress endpoints.
* We now only monitor the selected endpoint type (OpenShift Routes or Ingress), removing an error message which appeared when starting the operator in a non-OpenShift cluster.
* We have added several features which make it possible to use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) with Ingress — this allows you to have TLS certificates generated on-demand.
* We added an option to specify an environment's TLS certificate, or load it from a Kubernetes secret.
* When TLS is enabled, Mendix for Private Cloud Portal will now display the App URL with an https:// prefix.

#### Mendix Operator v1.1.0

To upgrade an existing installation of Private Cloud to this version, follow the [Upgrade instructions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-upgrade-guide/).

* Mendix apps now run as Kubernetes Deployments instead of StatefulSets. This will allow you to use rolling updates, reducing downtime. In addition, this helps avoid situations where a StatefulSet might become stuck and stop processing any changes.
* We now allow you to set Kubernetes resource requirements in addition to resource limits. Apps no longer require the maximum amount of CPU and memory, improving utilization of cluster resources.
* We improved the default health check configuration by adjusting the default Kubernetes liveness and readiness probe configuration. Kubernetes will now be much quicker in detecting that an environment has started and is ready to serve requests. In addition, the Kubernetes liveness probe will start with a delay to give a Mendix app some time to start and perform migrations.
* We have added a port to enable monitoring of Mendix apps with Prometheus.
* We have added an option to make a storage plan dedicated so that it can be used by only one environment.
* We have added support for Microsoft SQL server and Azure SQL databases.
* We have fixed a regression which prevented Private Cloud installing when using kubectl version 1.18.

#### Mendix Gateway Agent v1.1.0

To upgrade an existing installation of Private Cloud to the latest version, follow the [Upgrade instructions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-upgrade-guide/).

* We have improved the reliability of event processing and cluster authentication.

#### Mendix Operator v1.0.1

* We have added an additional field to the `MendixApp` CR which will allows the Developer Portal to display the latest state of environments.
* We have improved compatibility with popular container image registries (such as Azure Container Registry). The build process can now recognize that the container image already has the necessary base layers, and avoids downloading them again, saving time and network traffic.

#### Mendix Gateway Agent v1.0.1

* We have improved the reliability of sending environment statuses to the Developer Portal.

### March 23rd, 2020

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where users could not accept invitations to join a cluster.
* We fixed an issue were the first time an app was deployed no replicas were started, meaning that it was still in a stopped state. Now all apps will have one replica started when they are deployed for the first time.

### March 4th, 2020

#### Improvements

* You can now deploy Mendix apps easily to Kubernetes-based platforms. We currently support Red Hat OpenShift, Amazon Web Services Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS-EKS), and Amazon Web Services Azure Kubernetes Service (AWS-AKS). This involves deploying a Mendix Operator to your cluster to manage the Mendix requests. For more information see the [Private Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/) documentation.

## 2019

### December 5th, 2019

#### Improvements

* On the **General** page of [App Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz/#app-buzz), we added a **Private Cloud** target. This will currently take you to a closed Beta test that allows you to connect your private cluster to Mendix. You can ask to join the Beta program, but places are currently limited.
