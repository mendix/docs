## Behavior Properties

### Maximum number of rows

Indicates the maximum number of rows that can be present in the datagrid when exporting. Useful to prevent users from exporting large quantities of data, potentially placing a heavy load on the server.

### Use grid date format

If true, the date format of the column is used, otherwise a format that is recognized by Excel as a date is used (yyyy-MM-dd).

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

The date format of the columns is used to determine whether only the date, only the time or both date and time should be exported in this Excel compatible format.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Generate Excel seperator hint

If true, adds an extra line to the CSV file header that informs Excel what the seperator character is. This solves compatibility issues with Excel and localization.
