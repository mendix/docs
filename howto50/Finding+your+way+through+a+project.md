This how-to explains how you can find your way through a project in the Mendix Business Modeler. At many places in the Business Modeler you can access a handy menu by clicking the right mouse button. Two options are commonly used to find your way through a project and they are called 'Go-To' and 'Find usages'. The 'Go-To' option for example allows you to navigate to the target of a button or to the source of data grid. The 'Find Usages' option for example allows you to find all buttons that are opening a certain page.
