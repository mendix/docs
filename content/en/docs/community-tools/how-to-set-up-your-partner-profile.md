## Introduction

The purpose of the Partner Profile is to provide the Mendix community and customers with a transparent overview of each partner company's knowledge, skills, experience, reviews, and culture. The profile is a simple and clear way for each partner to present themselves through an aggregated view of the developers in the organization, including the number of certified developers. It is also possible to add projects, customer reviews, contact information, a company video, and a description to each profile.

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Set up and edit the Mendix Partner Profile
* Add projects to the profile
* Add developers to the profile

## Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Have a Mendix Profile (register [here](https://www.mendix.com/try-now/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=signup) and see [Mendix Profile](/community-tools/mendix-profile/))

## Signing In to the Partner Profile

To sign in to the Partner Profile, edit it, and make it public, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your own Mendix Profile [here](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/openid/login?immediate=true&continuation=link/ownprofile/). Now Mendix knows who you are and which company is attached to your account.
2. At the top of your Community Profile, you will see your role and company (for example, "Senior Developer at **Finaps**"). When your company is a partner, the company name is clickable. Click your company name to go to its Partner Profile. 
3. If you are authorized as a Partner Profile Editor, click **Edit Partner Profile** to edit the profile:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/edit-partner-profile.png" class="no-border" >}}

    If you are not authorized to edit the profile but your colleagues are, a list with their email addresses is shown. To gain access to editing the profile, you can contact them so that they can add you as an editor (for details, see the [Changing the Profile Editor](#editors) section). If none of your colleagues are authorized, click **Feedback** on the right side of the screen and submit a feedback item to gain access.<br>

4. Once you are in edit mode, click the form field to edit the Partner Profile:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/edit-profile-field.png" class="no-border" >}}
    
    For details about editing, start with the [Editing the Overview](#editing) section below.<br>

5. After you have finished editing, you can make the profile public so that the Mendix community and customers can view it. To do this, simply click **Save and Exit**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/close-edit.png"  width="343px" class="no-border" >}}

## Editing the Partner Profile Header

### Header Elements

The header of your Partner Profile has important contact details about your company:

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/header.png"   width="400"  class="no-border" >}}

You must complete the **Address** and **Email Address** fields before you can make your Partner Profile public (the email address will allow customers to contact you via the **Contact us** button). So, click **Edit Profile** and add this information to the header:

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/address.png"   width="550"  class="no-border" >}}

### Capability Levels {#capability}

The header also displays whether the company is **Authorized**, **Expert**, or **Professional**. These capability levels are defined as follows:

* **Authorized** — this type of partner has qualified and certified resources to support customers with Mendix initiatives 
* **Platform** — this type of partner can support an enterprise in its successful positioning and adoption of the Mendix Platform with all elements of the Mendix "4 P's" (portfolio, people, process, and platform; for details, see [How to Implement Bimodal IT: Focus on the 4 P’s](https://www.mendix.com/blog/how-to-implement-bimodal-it-focus-on-the-4-ps/))
* **Global** — this type of partner can help an enterprise with large scale programs spanning multiple countries or regions across the globe

A capability level is determined through an assessment of your company's delivery expertise, project references, and Mendix Developer Certification levels. For more information, please contact your Mendix Customer Success Manager.

## Editing the Overview {#editing}

## Editing Team Members {#team}

This section presents information on adding the most valuable assets of your company: your certified Mendix developers. Before you can add a developer to the Partner Profile, their Mendix Profile needs to be set to public (for details on how to do this, see the [Profile](/community-tools/mendix-profile/user-settings/#profile) section of *Mendix Profile*.

To add developers to the Partner Profile, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Developers** tab, where all the certified Mendix developers in your company are shown:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/team-members.png"   width="550"  class="no-border" >}}

    You can use the **Sort by**, **Search**, and **Certification Level** features to find a specific team member.

2. Select the active team members within your organization whose certifications you want to be visible on your Partner Profile by clicking **Add to profile**. The certification of each developer added to the profile will be visible in the statistics in the profile header, where numbers for **Rapid Developers**, **Advanced Developers**, **Expert Developers**, total **Mx Developers** (all developers added to the profile), and total **Mx Developers** (all existing developers) are displayed.

    Only the certifications and points of the added developers will be counted in the Partner Profile. The highest rank of certification will be added to the overview.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Make sure you offboard and deactivate the developers who no longer work at your company through [Control Center](/control-center/).

## Editing Testimonials

On the **Testimonials** tab, all the testimonials on your company and projects are available. These testimonials are approved by your company's Profile Editor before they are displayed on the profile. 

You can do further editing to the testimonials with the following buttons:

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/testimonials.png"   width="250"  class="no-border" >}}

* **Edit** – opens the testimonial editor, where you can edit details of the testimonial
* **Delete** – deletes the testimonial
* **Show on profile** – displays the testimonial on your company's Partner Profile

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Providing accurate testimonials is an important part of participating in the Mendix community, as is respecting the testimonials that have been given. So, while you are able to edit the details of a testimonial about your company, please respect the original intent of the writer of a testimonial that has already been approved by your company's Profile Editor.
{{% /alert %}}

## Changing the Profile Editor {#editors}

To make a colleague a profile editor, follow these steps:

1. On the Partner Profile, click the **Profile editor(s)** tab.
2. The **Select profile editor(s)** dialog box displays all the employees of your company. Select the colleague who you want to make a profile editor.
3. Click **Make Profile Editor**.

## Sorting on the Partners Overview Page

The [Meet Our Partners page](https://developerprofiles.mendix.com/link/partneroverview) is an overview that presents all the partners in the Mendix community. The sorting is based on a combination of the following KPIs:

* Whether your company is Expert (which will get the most weight in sorting), Professional, or Authorized (for more information, see the [Capability Tracks](#capability) section)
* The total amount of certified developers (note that developers with multiple certifications count as one certified developer)
* The total number of projects you have published on your Partner Profile
