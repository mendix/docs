## 1 Introduction 

The **Theme Customizer** is a tool that helps you customize your app in Mendix Studio. For example, you can adjust colors, upload logo, change text style, thus making your app look the way you want.

The **Theme Customizer** is divided into two panes:

* [Settings](#theme-customizer-settings) 
* [Preview](#theme-customizer-preview)

At the bottom of the **Theme Customizer** you can see two buttons with following functions: 

* **Reset Style** – click it to reset changes and restore the values that were there when you opened the **Theme Customizer** (but you can't reset changes once you have clicked **Apply Style**)
* **Apply Style** – click it to save changes

## 2 Settings Pane {#theme-customizer-settings}

In **Settings** you can change the way your app looks. The changes that you can make using the **Settings** pane are described in the table below. 

| Section          | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Upload Logo      | You can upload a picture that will be used as a logo in your app. You can upload  images with extensions png, jpg, jpeg, gif, svg. <br />Once the logo is uploaded, its colors will appear in the drop-down window for adjusting colors of such elements as buttons, text, top and side bars in the **Theme Customizer**. Thus, you can select colors from **Logo Colors** to make your app the same style as your logo. For more information, see [**Adjusting Colors**](#adjusting-colors). |
| Brand Colors     | In this section you can choose the main colors of your app (mostly used for buttons). |
| UI Customization | In this section, you can adjust the style and color of the main UI elements: <ul><li>Topbar</li><li>Sidebar</li><li>Backgrounds</li></ul> |
| Typography       | Use this section to override the text styles and text colors for your app. |
