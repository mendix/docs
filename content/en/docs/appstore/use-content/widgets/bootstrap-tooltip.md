## Introduction

The [Bootstrap Tooltip](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1939/) widget adds a tooltip to a user-defined field that contains help text or extra information.

### Typical Usage Scenario

* Add help text to an input field that is visible upon focus
* Add informative text for buttons that is visible upon hovering

### Feature

* Based on Bootstrap's *tooltip.js*

## Installation

To install, import the Bootstrap Tooltip widget into your app and add the widget on a page. Locate the widget as close to the target element as possible (preferably next to it).     

When an element has a tooltip attached to it and needs to be conditionally visible, put both the element and the tooltip together in a container and apply the visibility conditions to the container instead of the element:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/widgets/bootstrap-tooltip/tooltip.png" class="no-border" >}}

## Configuration

You can configure the properties below to determine how the widget will behave in your application.

### Appearance Tab

* **Target element classname** – the class name of the field to which you want to attach the tooltip
* **Render HTML** – selecting **Yes** renders the tooltip content as HTML
* **Tooltip position** – the location of the tooltip relative to the field
* **Tooltip mode** – when to show the tooltip

### Data Source Tab

* **Default text** – the text displayed when no data source microflow is defined
* **Tooltip source microflow** – the microflow that returns the text to be displayed in the tooltip
