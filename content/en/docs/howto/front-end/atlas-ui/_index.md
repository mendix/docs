## 1 Introduction

Mendix offers Atlas UI, a cross-platform UI framework that gives teams the foundation they need to build engaging, high-quality experiences and brings UX, IT, and business together. See the [Atlas 3](https://atlas.mendix.com) site additional information on Atlas.

If you use an older version of Mendix Studio Pro, see [atlas2.mendix.com](https://atlas2.mendix.com/) for information on Atlas 2.

If you are migrating from Atlas 2 to Atlas 3, see [How to Migrate from Atlas 2 to Atlas 3](/refguide/moving-from-atlas-2-to-3/).

Atlas comes with a default design system which can be fully tailored and extended. New apps are based on this design system. For more information, see the [Atlas Design System](https://atlasdesignsystem.mendixcloud.com/) website.

The following how-to's are available here:

* [Customize Styling](/howto/front-end/customize-styling-new/) — Customize your styling in deeper ways. Specifically, you will see how our progressive and web apps use SASS (SCSS) and our  native mobile apps use JavaScript to create your app's styling.
* [Configure Module-Level Theme Settings](/howto/front-end/module-level-theme-settings/) — Use module-level theme settings to control theme system behavior. This allows you to control which elements your developers can and cannot use.
