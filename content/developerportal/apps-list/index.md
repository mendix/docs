The actions available depend on the app selected:

* **Edit in Mendix Studio**
* **Edit in Mendix Studio Pro** – for apps where Mendix Studio is not enabled
* **Project Management** – opens the app [Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz)
* **App Info** – opens the [general settings](/developerportal/settings/general-settings) of the app
* **Delete App** – allows you to delete your app, provided you are the only team member (you will be warned of the consequences and asked for confirmation before the app is deleted)

### 2.4 Favoriting an App {#favoriting}

To favorite an app, click the star so that it turns yellow in the top-left corner of the app's tile:

You cannot change the sort order of your apps.

If you click an app for which you are a team member, you will be taken to the app [Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz).

If you click an app for which you are not an App Team member, you will see the app details:
