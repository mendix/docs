## 1 Buzz Locations

Located in the Developer Portal, Buzz lets you see Mendix app activity in your company as well as collaborate and share ideas with your team. There are two types of **Buzz** pages: an app **Buzz** page and a **Company Buzz** page.

## 2 App Buzz {#app-buzz}

App **Buzz** is for a specific app:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/buzz/app-buzz.png" class="image-border" >}}

You can see the size of your **Team** and your team members on the right side of the page. Up to 25 team members can be displayed here at a time.

Click **Invite someone to your team** ({{% icon name="add-circle" %}}) to invite new members to your team directly. Click **Show All** to go to the [Team](/developerportal/general/team/) page for the app.

## 3 Company Buzz {#company-buzz}

The **Company Buzz** is accessible via the top bar in the Developer Portal:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/buzz/company-buzz.png" >}}

The drop-down menu for the content you see in the Company Buzz is set to **All Channels** by default. This shows Buzz activity for all the apps for which you are a team member, as well as all Buzz activity for your company. In the menu, you can choose to see only Buzz for your company or for a specific app for which you are a team member. 

Clicking an app name in **Recent Apps** will take you to the [App Buzz](#app-buzz) for that app, described below.

## 4 Communicating on Buzz

The easiest way to communicate with others in your company and on your team is by leaving comments in Buzz. In the **Update status** box, add a comment and click **Share**. You can also attach an image or a document via **Add**.

Once you have posted a comment, you can click **Edit** to **Update Message** or **Delete**. You can also **Reply in Thread** to comments left by colleagues.

On  **Company Buzz**, both Company Buzz and App Buzz communication can be seen by all users in your company via the **All Channels** filter or the company filter.
