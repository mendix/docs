## 2 Revisions

Each line in the grid represents a revision in the repository. For each revision the following information is shown:

* **Revision** number – the number of the revision in the repository. Revision numbers do not have to be consecutive if there is also activity in other development lines. Revision numbers are unique for a whole repository.
* **Changes** – a visual summary of the changes in the selected revision. It shows whether there are model changes, disk changes and whether there was a change in Studio Pro version that was used to commit the revision (green arrow up). Hover over this column to get a textual summary.
* **Author** – the person who committed this revision.
* **Date** – the date of the commit.
* **Time** – the time of the commit.
* **Message** – the user entered message of the commit. If the message is long, you can more easily read it in the Message tab page below.

By selecting a revision in this grid, the tab pages below it will be filled with information about this revision.
