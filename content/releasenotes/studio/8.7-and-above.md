## 2020

### June 3rd, 2020

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 8.10](../studio-pro/8.10). 

### May 18th, 2020

#### Fixes:

* We fixed an issue where users could not see and select associations in the **Select Entity** dialog box.

### May 6th, 2020

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 8.9](../studio-pro/8.9). 

#### Improvements

* We now keep highlighting widgets which have consistency errors (the red border) or conditional visibility property set (the green border) when you edit an element inline.

#### Fixes:

* We fixed a bug in microflows where if you were in read-only mode, and your team member had edited something in microflows, your app crashed after you took over. 

### April 14th, 2020

#### New Features

* To give you more flexibility when creating pages, we added [Conditional Visibility](/studio/page-editor-widgets-visibility-section) to widget properties. It allows you to show a widget only when certain conditions are met. For example, you have a web shop and you do not want to bother users with filling in the same address twice when the delivery address matches the billing address. In this case, you can make billing address fields visible to users only when they check the option that delivery and billing addresses do not match. 

	You can also highlight which widgets have conditional visibility set by clicking the eye icon of the **Show** option in the top-left corner of pages:

	![](../../studio/attachments/page-editor-widgets-visibility-section/highlight-conditional-items.png)

* You have more flexibility when configuring input elements and file and image widgets on pages now! You can set **Conditional Editability** that allows you to make a widget editable only if specified conditions are met based on an attribute value. For example, you would like to make the **City** field editable only when users fill the **Country** field in, because you can deliver your products to a limited number of countries. For more information, see the [Editability](/studio/page-editor-widgets-input-elements#editability) section in *Input Elements* and the [Editability](/studio/page-editor-widgets-images-and-files#editability) section in *Images & Files*.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where enabling security in Studio, resulted in not being able to log in to the app for Studio Pro users if they previewed the app locally. 

### March 31st, 2020

#### Improvements

* We improved the service that makes it possible to manage your app users. As of April 1st, 2020 we are replacing the current service with an improved one. You might be notified that an auto-upgrade of the security settings of your app is required before you can publish your app:

	{{% image_container width="350" %}}![](../../studio/attachments/settings-security/upgrade.png){{% /image_container %}}
	
	If you do not auto-upgrade this service, your app will still be secured and running, but you will not be able to publish a newer version of your app. For more information, see the [Auto-Upgrade to the New Service](/studio/settings-security#upgrade) section in *Security, Roles & Permissions*.
	
* You can resolve [consistency checks](/studio/consistency-errors) faster and easier! All elements, such as widgets or microflow elements, that require your attention are now marked with a clear indicator:

	{{% image_container width="300" %}}![](attachments/8.7/error-highlight.png){{% /image_container %}}

### March 16th, 2020

#### Improvements

* To speed up the process of creating pages, we added an opportunity to clear the selected attribute. Simply click the **Clear** button:

    {{% image_container width="300" %}}![](attachments/8.7/clear-attribute.png){{% /image_container %}}

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue, where errors were not shown when you configured an enumeration, but you could not proceed because of these errors. 


### March 9th, 2020

#### Fixes

* We fixed a bug when a spinner was not displayed while securing an app before publishing it.
* We fixed an issue where you could not manage users if your app had the AppCloudServices module instead of the [Mendix SSO](/appstore/modules/mendix-sso) module.

### March 2nd, 2020

#### New Features

* It is now possible to copy and paste [enumerations](/studio/domain-models-enumeration) between Studio apps, which will allow you to build apps faster. You can also duplicate enumerations:

    ![Copy Pasting Enumerations](attachments/8.7/enumeration-copy-paste.png)

* We added support for [Studio Pro 8.7](../studio-pro/8.7). 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in [Studio Buzz](/studio/buzz) where the **Create Feedback Item** button was not working.
* We fixed an issue where it was not possible to add a new page or microflow in app templates.
