{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The Deploy API only works for apps which are deployed to the Mendix Cloud.

## 1 Introduction

The Deploy API allows you to manage application environments in the Mendix Cloud. Version 3 introduces additional actions and improved actions for some actions.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The V3 Deploy API only supports the endpoints listed here. For all other API calls, the [V2 API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api-2/) or [V1 API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/) must be used.
{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Authentication{#authentication}

Authentication for the Deploy API v3 uses a personal access token (PAT).

### 2.1 Generating a PAT

To generate a PAT, see the [Personal Access Tokens](/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/#pat) section of *Mendix Profile*.

Select the following as **Deployment Mendix Cloud** scopes:

* `mx:deployment:read` – to perform `GET` operations
* `mx:deployment:write` – to perform all operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`)

Store the generated value `{GENERATED_PAT}` somewhere safe so you can use it to authorize your Mendix Cloud Deploy API calls.

### 2.2 Using the PAT

Each request must contain an `Authorization` header with the value `MxToken {GENERATED_PAT}`. For example:

```http {linenos=false}
GET /api/v3/clusters HTTP/1.1
Authorization: MxToken 7LJE…vk
```

To authenticate calls when using the Open API specification below, click **Authorize** and use the value `MxToken {GENERATED_PAT}`.

## 3 Examples

If you need to retrieve app and environment information in an app, you will have to use the [Deploy API – Version 1](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/) calls to do this.

The {appId} in version 3 is retrieved as the {ProjectId} from the version 1 API.

### 3.1 Using the API to Change the Technical Contact

The following steps will change the Technical Contact of the app identified by the UUID {appId}.

1. Set up your authentication PAT. You must have permission to change the Technical Contact of the app.
1. Create a request body containing the userId of the new Technical Contact. For example, to make jane.doe@domain.tld the new Technical Contact, provide a body as shown below:

    ```json {linenos=false}
    {
      "technicalContact": {
        "userId": "jane.doe@domain.tld"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Call `PATCH /apps/{appId}` to update the Technical Contact for your app. For example:

    ```http {linenos=false}
    PATCH /apps/80a28d6e-c5fc-43d9-87c2-d7d56b07542e
    ```

### 3.2 Using the API to Change App Team Members' Access Permissions to an Environment

The following steps will change the permissions of a team member to an environment of the app identified by the UUID {appId}.

1. Set up your authentication PAT. You must have permission to **Manage Permissions** for the app.
1. Call `GET /apps/{appId}/environments/{environmentId}/permissions` to get the existing Team Members' permissions for this {environmentId} of this {appId}. For example:

    ```http {linenos=false}
    GET /apps/80a28d6e-c5fc-43d9-87c2-d7d56b07542e/environments/6b61f27c-dac9-48c5-b359-f861374ceb36/permissions
    ```

1. Update the JSON describing the existing permissions to give the permissions you want. For example, to give john.doe@domain.tld permission to deploy an app, but no other permissions, update the body as shown below:

    ```json {linenos=false}
    …
    {
      "member": {
        "userId": "john.doe@domain.tld"
      },
      "canDeployApp": true,
      "canManageBackups": false,
      "canViewAlerts": false,
      "canAccessAPI": false,
      "canViewLogs": false,
      "canManagePrivileges": false
    }
    …
    ```

1. Call `PATCH /apps/{appId}/environments/{environmentId}/permissions` to update the Team Members' permissions for this {environmentId} of this {appId}.
