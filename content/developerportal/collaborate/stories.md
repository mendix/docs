## 1 Introduction

In **Stories**, you are able to manage Sprints, stories, and labels for your app. These components are often used in an Agile development environment, in which teams work in short development cycles (Sprints) of 2–4 weeks.

By adding your Sprints to Mendix, you will have a clear overview of your tasks and can easily view the status of the development of your app. You can create, refine, and prioritize user stories collaboratively using the stories' conversation threads. User stories can be estimated and organized into Sprints which can be monitored using Scrum boards and burndown charts.

You can also manage the progress of tasks and Sprints from within Mendix Studio Pro via the [Stories pane](/refguide/stories-pane).

Fill in the following details:

After you click **Import / Export**, you will be asked what you want to do:

{{% image_container width="350" %}}
![](attachments/stories/import-export.png)
{{% /image_container %}}

In Mendix, you can export stories from your app at any time. If you select **Export a single sprint to Excel**, you can select just the stories in one Sprint and export these to Excel to work on.

You can also **Export all stories to Excel** and even **Export all stories to Excel (including completed sprints)**.

If you select **Updates stories from Excel**, you can use an an Excel sheet from a previous export as a template for the import. The Developer Portal recognizes existing items by using the **ID** column. The imported content will become stories for your app.

When editing stories in Excel, follow these guidelines:

* To add a new story or task,  add a new line on the correct position and enter the item's name
* To reorder an item, adjust the depth by adding or removing the plus signs (make sure they stay consistent with every item being the same or one level deeper than the item above it)
* To remove an item, replace its depth with a single minus sign (make sure that any tasks associated with it are either moved or are also removed)

#### 2.4.2 Managing Labels {#managing-labels}

The **Manage labels** page is where you can add or remove your labels:

{{% image_container width="550" %}}
