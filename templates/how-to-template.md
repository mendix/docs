title: "Enter the title of the document"
#category: "Enter the category under which the document should be published (for example, "Mobile"); if there is a parent, remove this category line"
#parent: "Enter the parent document filename of this document if necessary (for example, "design-the-architecture"); if there is a category, remove this parent line"
#menu_order: Enter the position of the document in the category or under the parent; number by 10 (for first), 20, 30, etc. for easy ordering of other documents in the future if necessary; don't add brackets or quotation marks; if no number is added, the system will add an extremely high number to order the documents, which means that if you only want a document to appear at the top, you only have to add "10" to that specific document, you don't have to order all the other documents in the category/under the parent
#description: "Set a description with a maximum of 140 characters; this should describe what the goal of the document is, and it can be different from the document introduction; this is optional, and it can be removed"
#tags: [Add a maximum of 5-7 tags/keywords; keep them focused on the most important topics of the document, and make sure the tag is used as a word in the actual content (will function best for SEO as a word in a heading); each tag should have quotation marks and be separated by a comma, for example: "Samba", "MxCloud", "cloud", "share"; the tags should be enclosed with brackets and quotation marks]
