## 1 Introduction

This document describes the prerequisites for the create custom action how-to's. Each chapter gives a description of what is expected in that prerequisite.

## 2 Mendix Rapid App Developer

General knowledge of the Mendix platform is a must when creating custom actions. The HTML of a Mendix app is a direct representation of your app as you see it in the modeler. 

During the [Mendix Rapid App Developer](https://developers.mendix.com/training/) course, you learn all the fundamentals of the Mendix platform. How the different widgets work and how to adjust them. This is a great advantage when looking at a widget through the HTML.

## 3 The Guidelines for Building a Custom Action

[The Guidelines for Building a Custom Action](/bestpractices/guidelines-custom-action) is a best practice that describes the guidelines that you must follow when building custom actions. This delivers the best results.

## 4 Google Chrome and basics Chrome DevTools

The how-to's make use of the Google Chrome web browser and the Chrome DevTools. You must have a basic understanding of the Chrome DevTools to get the full experience from each how-to. 
When you use the Google Chrome browser you can follow the how-to's to the letter. You may use other browsers and their DevTools, but those might not be comparable with the how-to. 

Google provides [how-to's](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) for learning more about the DevTools.

## 5 Understanding of HTML Structure 

The how-to's use the debugger a lot to see the HTML of the page. An understanding of HTML helps a lot when creating custom actions. An understanding of the following points is enough:

* HTML Hierarchy
* Basic structure (Different type of elements etc.)

See [W3Cschools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) for more information.

## 6 ATS Selectors

The how-to's use jQuery selectors to find elements in the browser. Next, to the standard jQuery selectors, ATS also uses pseudo selectors. You can find these pseudo-selectors in the [ATS Selector](/refguide-ats-1/selectors) documentation.

Check out the [Helpful Resources](custom-action-helpful-resources) section for more information on selectors.

## 7 General ATS Knowledge

The how-to's describe how to create custom actions. They do not describe every step. If the how-to says to add this action, you must add the action, the how-to does not describe this process. Make sure you know the basics of ATS, how to search for actions etc.

## 8 Custom Action Basics

The how-to's don't explain everything in detail. Simple things like adding an input parameter are not explained. Make sure you completed the [Custom Action Basics](custom-action-basics) how-to.
