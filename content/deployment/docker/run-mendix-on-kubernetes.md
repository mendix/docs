## 1 Introduction

This how-to describes what is needed to deploy your Mendix app to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) following Mendix best practices. Kubernetes extends Mendix's support for Docker by providing a platform to automate deployments and scale apps with high availability.

This how-to uses [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/), which is a way to run Kubernetes locally. Many of the operations you perform on Minikube are the same as those on a hosted environment, and it provides a low-level entry to Kubernetes. For more information, see [Turn-key Cloud Solutions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/).

For more details on Kubernetes, see [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

All the configuration files used in this how-to are also available on GitHub.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Deploy and run a Mendix app on Kubernetes using Minikube
* Separate the database deployment from your app
* Attach persistence storage to the app container

## 2 Prerequisites

To follow this how-to, having a basic knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes is recommended. For more information to get started, see [Docker Overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) and [Kubernetes Basics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/). Although all the commands and examples will be executable as provided, some experience will help to understand the how-to better.

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Install kubectl
    * The kubectl CLI is the default tool to access and manage your Kubernetes cluster
    * Install kubectl based on the instructions provided in [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl)
* Install Minikube
    * With Minikube, a local cluster can be created that is convenient for exploring Kubernetes (if you have an account for one of the cloud providers and you choose to use that, this step can be skipped)
    * Install Minikube based on the instructions provided in [Install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)

The how-to is based on working with a Unix-like system. The commands for Windows may be slightly different.

## 3 Architecture Overview

This section explains the components needed for Mendix app deployment. This architecture overview shows all the components in the deployment:

![](attachments/run-mendix-on-kubernetes/kubernetes.png)

The deployment of your Mendix app needs the following Kubernetes components:

* [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
* [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
* [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
* [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)
* [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/)

The database is deployed as a **deployment**. Deployment covers control over the pods and the ReplicaSets for these pods. **Pods** are not bound to a specific node in the cluster unless set with selector labels. A deployment can scale pods on one or mode nodes, and it recovers pods when they crash.

The Mendix application is deployed using a **StatefulSet**. The StatefulSet generally provides the same control options as a deployment, but it will provide a stable index number to the pod as well as network ID and storage. The StatefulSet is used for the application to get the unique pod index number to identify which of the instances is allowed to run scheduled events.

Data storage should be externalized as much as possible, given how pods can be created, destroyed, or moved around. Destroying a pod will also destroy any data stored inside the containers started by the pod. When scaling the app, all instances should be able to retrieve the same data. This how-to uses node-bound **volume** mounts, but please check the list of available [clustered storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) options.

To access your Mendix applications inside a pod from outside of the Kubernetes, a **service** must be created exposing the port. Services deal with pod discovery and pod lifecycles, so the consumer of a particular service doesn't need to know where a pod is or what IP is needed to access it.

## 4 Deploying the Components

### 4.1 Deploying the PostgreSQL Database

The first step is deploying our database. For Minikube, an external folder to persist the data outside of the database pod is used.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

For simplicity and compatibility with ```minikube```, we mount a folder from the ```minikube node```. This approach is not recommended for production.

{{% /alert %}}

Here is the definition of the `postgres-deployment.yaml` database component:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        service: postgres
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres:10.1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_DB
              value: db0
            - name: POSTGRES_USER
              value: mendix
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              value: mendix
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
              name: "mendix-pgdata"
      volumes:
        - hostPath:
            path: "/home/docker/pgdata"
          name: mendix-pgdata
```

To create the PostgreSQL database, we use the provided [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) image. The environment variables provided in `env` are needed to configure the default database. Instead of setting the password in the *yaml* file directly, you can choose to use [secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

And finally, it is necessary to expose the database as a service and make it available to the application. This is the definition of such a service:

(`postgres-service.yaml`):

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 5432
  selector:
    service: postgres
```

To create all the mentioned components, use the following:

```
kubectl create -f postgres-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f postgres-service.yaml
```

The database is now created. To verify the installation, check out the logs:

```
# kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -lservice=postgres -o name)
```

This is the expected output:

```
2017-09-14 08:34:37.538 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

Windows users need to execute this inline command first to get the pod name and the logs:

```
# kubectl get pods -lservice=postgres -o name
pods/posgres-whSsHA

# kubectl logs <name>
```

### 4.2 Deploying the Application

With the database running, we can deploy our application. We'll be using a sample Docker container with a Mendix app published in [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/mendix/sample-app-kubernetes/). To create a new Docker container for your Mendix app, see the description on the [docker-mendix-buildpack](https://github.com/mendix/docker-mendix-buildpack).

Before deploying the app, we'll create some secrets so that sensitive information for the application doesn't need to be in our *yaml* file. The secret file has to be applied only once to the cluster, and the values will be kept there. For information on all of the options, see [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

`mendix-app-secrets.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mendix-app-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  admin-password: YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD
  db-endpoint: YOUR_DATABASE_ENDPOINT
  license-key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
  license-id: YOUR_LICENSE_ID
```

To create the secret in Kubernetes we execute the following command:

```
$ kubectl create -f mendix-app-secrets.yaml
```

Once the database service and the secrets are created, you can create the application, which is defined in the file below.

`mendix-app.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mendix-k8s-stateful
  labels:
    app: mendix-k8s
spec:
  serviceName: mendix-k8s-ss
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mendix-k8s
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mendix-k8s
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mendix-app
          image: mendix/sample-app-kubernetes:v2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: "/build/data/files"
              name: mendix-data
          env:
            - name: ADMIN_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mendix-app-secrets
                  key: admin-password
            - name: LICENSE_ID
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mendix-app-secrets
                  key: license-id
            - name: LICENSE_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mendix-app-secrets
                  key: license-key
            - name: DATABASE_ENDPOINT
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mendix-app-secrets
                  key: db-endpoint
      volumes:
        - hostPath:
            path: "/home/docker/mendix-files"
          name: mendix-data

```

In this example, we use a local storage folder on the node to show how to externalize the data stored for your app from the Docker container. For production systems, we recommend using the storage provided on the selected cloud platform.

Deploy the application to Kubernetes:

```
kubectl create -f mendix-app.yaml
```

#### 4.2.1 Some Notes on Scaling

The Mendix 7 Runtime is stateless, meaning that a client can talk to any server instance. However, scheduled events and database migrations should be handled by only one instance. For this, we use a container index count. The pod with index 0 will always trigger the schedule events and deal with database updates in case of an upgrade version.

To get a container index on Kubernetes, a StatefulSet can be used, which will append the instance index to the container's hostname. A deployment does not do this.

It should be noted that using a StatefulSet versus a deployment involves some difference in behavior. For example, a pod won't move to a different node when it crashes, and when the node is not reachable, the pod is not recreated on another system.

### 4.3 Making the App Available

To make the app available from the browser, it needs to be accessible outside of the cluster. For this, we use a service of the LoadBalancer or NodePort type. For Minikube we can use both, which exposes the app via an IP address.

If you deploy to a cloud provider, the method for publishing your app may be different (for example, some cloud providers can automatically update the load balancer to forward a URL request to the cluster). For more information, see [Create an External Load Balancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/).

The definition of publishing the Mendix app as a NodePort service is described in the following file:

`mendix-app-service.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mendix-app-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: mendix-k8s
  type: NodePort
```

Deploy the service:

```
kubectl create -f mendix-app-service.yaml
```

To get the URL to the application on Minikube, execute this command and open the link in your browser:

```
minikube service mendix-app-service --url
```

Congratulations! You have deployed your first Mendix app in Kubernetes.
