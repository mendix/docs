Pressing the sidebar toggle button will make a region of a [scroll container](Scroll+Container) appear or disappear. This makes it possible to create sidebars (for example, a menu on a mobile phone that is hidden by default and can be shown by clicking the button). See the image below for an example layout that used the sidebar toggle.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

The sidebar toggle used to include settings to govern which layout region was toggled and how the transition was visualized. These configuration options were moved to the [scroll container region](Scroll+Container+Region) to improve transparency in Mendix 6.10.
