Cloud Foundry is an Open Source Platform-as-a-Service that can run all kinds of web applications. Its technical highlights are:

![](attachments/18448647/18580565.png)Horizontal Scaling

![](attachments/18448647/18580559.png)Applications run inside stateless containers

![](attachments/18448647/18580563.png)Applications are only reachable over HTTP, HTTPS or WebSockets

## Introduction

**Mendix 5.15** and up integrate with the Cloud Foundry ecosystem in multiple ways. We added support for external filestores to store FileDocuments, we made the session cookie name configurable to support horizontal scaling and we added Cloud Foundry support in the Mendix Business Modeler. Furthermore, we released V1.0 of our [Mendix Cloud Foundry BuildPack](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack).

## Compatibility

Mendix is compatible with all known versions of Cloud Foundry, as long as there are compatible database services (PostgreSQL or MySQL) and custom buildpacks can be used. External file store support can be set up with Amazon S3 or compatible systems. We have included two guides below for deploying Mendix apps to specific Cloud Foundry powered platforms: Pivotal Web Services and HP Helion Development Platform.

These guides focus on graphical interfaces, command line instructions can be found on the [GitHub page of our BuildPack](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack).
