This document describes the installation and configuration of the Mendix software on a system running Microsoft Windows.

In order to set up an environment to run Mendix applications, you will need to install the Mendix software. For each Mendix application that will be run, a separate user(service) account is required. It might help to grasp the full picture before following the rest of the documentation in this section about
steps which have to be executed to manually set up a server that runs a Mendix application. The following section describes an overview of the parts of the whole setup you'll encounter in the next pages.

## 2. Installation of the Mendix Service Console

In this chapter you will download an install the Mendix Service Console.

1.  Download the latest version of the **Mendix Service Console** from our **App Store** ([http://](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/modelers) [appstore.mendix.com](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/modelers)):
    ![](attachments/10813802/11042875.png)

2.  **Install** the Mendix Service Console by following the installation wizard.

3.  **Start** the Mendix Service Console after the installation.

    ![](attachments/10813802/11042877.png)
    The first time you launch the application, a preferences dialog will be shown. This dialog will always be shown if no valid location is configured for all the apps and server files.

*   Enter a location for the apps and server files.
    We advise use a directory that is _not_ on the system partition, where you can easily control the security rights.

    <div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

    The location configured in step 4 is used for storing your app files and Mendix server files.
    The app directory consists of 4 subdirectories:
    - Backup: This directory will store any database changes due to model upgrades
    - Log: This directory will store all of the application log files
    - Project: This directory contains all of your application files. Within this directory you will find the directory
    data/files that contain all of your uploaded files.
    - Service: This directory contains files for configuring the Windows Services.
    Furthermore there will be a file called “Settings.yaml” which contains your application configuration.

    {% endmarkdown %}</div>

Replace **requesthandler** with your own request handler needed for the application.

In the application directory under Project/Web you will find the web.config file which contains the Microsoft IIS configuration for the application. The contents of this file must be similar to this example:

**web.config**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <rewrite>
            <rules>
                <rule name="xas" stopProcessing="true">
                    <match url="^(xas/)(.*)" />
                    <action type="Rewrite" url="http://localhost:8080/{R:1}{R:2}" />
                </rule>
                <rule name="ws" stopProcessing="true">
                    <match url="^(ws/)(.*)" />
                    <action type="Rewrite" url="http://localhost:8080/{R:1}{R:2}" />
                </rule>
                <rule name="ws-doc" stopProcessing="true">
                    <match url="^(ws-doc/)(.*)" />
                    <action type="Rewrite" url="http://localhost:8080/{R:1}{R:2}" />
                </rule>
                <rule name="link" stopProcessing="true">
                    <match url="^(link/)(.*)" />
                    <action type="Rewrite" url="http://localhost:8080/{R:1}{R:2}" />
                </rule>
                <rule name="file" stopProcessing="true">
                    <match url="^(file)(.*)" />
                    <action type="Rewrite" url="http://localhost:8080/{R:1}{R:2}" />
                </rule>
            </rules>
        </rewrite>
        <staticContent>
            <mimeMap fileExtension=".mxf" mimeType="text/xml" />
        </staticContent>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration> 
```

## 5\. Preserve Host Header

To make sure the correct application root URL is used within your web services you must make sure the host header contains the original host header from the client request. To make sure the host header is preserved follow these steps:

1.  Click **Start**, and then click **All Programs**.
2.  Click **Accessories**, and then click **Command Prompt**.
3.  Execute the following command from the command prompt:

    ```java
    cd %windir%\system32\inetsrv
    ```

4.  Then type:

    ```java
    appcmd.exe set config -section:system.webServer/proxy /preserveHostHeader:"True" /commit:apphost
    ```
