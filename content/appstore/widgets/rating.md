## 2 Usage

To use this widget, place it in a [data container](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/data-sources) that has an Integer, Long or Decimal attribute.

The widget offers the following for configuration:

* An Integer, Long, or Decimal attribute to store the rating on user-interaction
* An action (such as microflow or nanoflow) to trigger when the value of rating changes
* An empty icon, to be shown when the value is not yet selected
* A selected icon, to be shown when the value is selected
* An amount to define the maximum amount of icons to be rendered
* Animation, to define whether the widget should animate when clicking on the desired icon  
* A **Size** design property with two options (`Small` and `Large`) influencing icon size
* [Common properties](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/common-widget-properties)

This widget is compatible with [Atlas Core](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117187).

## 3 For Widgets Version 2.0.0 and Below

### 3.1 Features

* Rate an object with stars
* Display average rating
* Display rating in whole and half stars
* Execute a microflow when the rate is changed

### 3.2 Customizing the Rating Icon

In order to overwrite the default star icon, add these classes to your project theme and replace the content with your preferred glyphicon:

```
 .rating-flag [class*="widget-star-rating-full"]:before {
  content: "\e034"; /* flag icon */ 
 }
.rating-flag .widget-star-rating-empty:before {
  content: "\e034"; /* flag icon */
 }
```
The `rating-flag` class should be added to the widget configuration on the **Common** tab.
