## 2 Deploy

In the **Deploy** tab, you can view information about your environment, as well as create, upload, delete, and deploy packages.

### 2.1 Deployment Package Repository

In the **Deployment Package Repository** section, you have an overview of all the available deployment packages with the following details:

* Deployment package name
* Version of the deployment package
* Creation date of the deployment package
* Uploaded by
* Expiry date of the deployment package

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/deployment-package.png" alt="The Deployment Package Repository section" >}}

You can perform the following actions in this section:

* **Create a Package from Team Server** – select a branch to build the revision that it contains
* **Upload** – upload a deployment package from your local device
* **Details**:
    * View the package size, description, build output, and an overview of the environments that are currently running this package
    * **Download** the package
    * **Delete package**
* **Deploy** – transport the package from Team Server to the selected environment

### 2.2 Environments

In the **Environments** section, you have an overview of all the available environments. The contents of this section are different based on whether your node supports flexible environments.

#### 2.2.1 Standard Environments

For standard environments, your node has the following set of environments: production, acceptance, and optionally also test.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/deploy-environments.png" alt="The Environments section for standard environments" >}}

The **Environments** section shows the following details:

* Environment name – for example, Acceptance
* Environment status – indicated by the color of the check mark next to the environment name:
    * Green – there are no alerts
    * Orange – there is at least one warning alert, but no critical alerts
    * Red – there is at least one critical alert
    
    The environment status is cached; there can be a delay of up to five minutes before the status icon displays a change of status. To see the details of the alerts, click **Alerts**. For more information, see [Alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health/).
    
* Deployment package name – for example, Main line-1.0.0.18.mda
* Deployment package version – for example, 1.0.0.18
* **Runtime** – the Mendix Studio Pro version with which the app is built, for example, 9.5.0
* The **URL** of the app – for example, `https://mytestapp.mendixcloud.com`

You can perform the following actions in this section:

* **Details** – for more information, see [Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/)
* **Transport to** – stage an environment to acceptance or production
* **Setup Studios Deployment** – the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) can set the target environment to which apps will be deployed from Studio and Studio Pro; for more information, see [Studio Deployment Settings](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/)

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/setup-studios-target.png" alt="The Environments section with the Setup Studios Deployment button visible" >}}

#### 2.2.2 Flexible Environments

If your node supports flexible environments, you can define the number and type of environments that you have. For example, you can have multiple staging environments if your deployment process requires it.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/deploy-flex-environments.png" alt="The Environments section with flexible environments" >}}

For flexible environments, the **Environments** section shows the following details:

* Environment name – for example, Acceptance
* **Prod** – this indicates whether the environment is a production environment; this is set when the environment is first created
* Environment status – indicated by the color of the check mark next to the environment name:
    * Green – there are no alerts
    * Orange – there is at least one warning alert, but no critical alerts
    * Red – there is at least one critical alert
    
    The environment status is cached; there can be a delay of up to five minutes before the status icon displays a change of status. To see the details of the alerts, click **Alerts**. For more information, see [Alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health/).
    
* Deployment package name – for example, Main line-1.0.0.18.mda
* Deployment package version – for example, 1.0.0.18
* **Runtime** – the Mendix Studio Pro version with which the app is built, for example, 9.5.0
* **Plan** – this indicates the plan for this environment; for more information, see [Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/)
* The **URL** of the app – for example, `https://mytestapp.mendixcloud.com`

You can perform the following actions in this section:

* **Details** – for more information, see [Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/)
* **Setup Studios Deployment** – the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) can set the target environment to which apps will be deployed from Studio and Studio Pro; for more information, see [Studio Deployment Settings](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/)

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/setup-studios-target.png" alt="The Environments section with the Setup Studios Deployment button visible" >}}

* **Search** – you can use the **Search** box to find a specific environment
* Reordering environments - the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) can reorder the environments by dragging them in the list, for example, to group environments of the same type together:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/reorder-environments.gif" alt="Reordering environments in a list" >}}

### 2.3 Activity

In the **Activity** section, you can view a log of deployment activities performed on your environments. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/activity.png" alt="Sample activity log" >}}

If you are the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact), you can download a copy of the activity log by performing the following steps:

1. Click **Download to CSV**.
2. Select the period for which you want to download log entries. For **Custom Period**, you must enter a valid period using **Start Date** and **End Date**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/download-activity-log.png" alt="Sample custom period with a validation error" >}}

3. Click **Download**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Operations performed on a customer's behalf through an authorized Mendix support ticket are not currently logged in the activity log.
{{% /alert %}}

## 3 Custom Domain

In the **Custom Domain** tab, you can manage your custom domain certificates at the application level, as well as see an overview of linked custom domains.

When your Mendix app needs to be accessible via your own URL (for example, `https://myapp.mycompany.com/`), you must provide a custom SSL/TLS certificate for your domain, so that we can make your Mendix app accessible via a secure connection. For more information, see [Custom Domains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/).

## 4 Access Restriction Profiles {#asp}

In the **Access Restriction Profiles** tab, you can manage custom access restriction profiles. These profiles can combine IP range filters and client certificate verification, so that any match on either the IP range or the client certificate will grant access. You can apply access restriction profiles to path-based access restrictions in specific environments of the application.

For more information on setting up access restriction profiles, see [Restrict Access for Incoming Requests](/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/).

## 5 Permissions {#permissions}

In the **Permissions** tab, the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) and other team members who have the Manage Permissions permission can manage various permissions to the environments for each team member. Team members who have the Deploy, Publish, and Monitor permission can view the permissions.

For more information on managing node permissions, see [Node Permissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/).

## 6 Services {#services}

In the **Services** tab, the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) can decide which custom services can be used in environments of this app.

### 6.1 Available Services

The custom services that are currently available on the app level, or the **Environments** page, are as follows:

* **Event Broker Service** – required to use [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/modules/business-events/) on production apps

### 6.2 Enabling Custom Services

The Technical Contact can only see services which have been licensed for their company. If the Technical Contact cannot enable the service, this means that it has previously been licensed but the license has expired.

Team members who have the Deploy, Publish, and Monitor permission can see which services are enabled or disabled.

Once a service has been enabled for an app, Technical Contacts can selectively enable it for each [environment](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#services).
