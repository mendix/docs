## 1 Introduction

Your App Team can include all of your colleagues working on an app project. As well as developing, team members might have other roles such as ideating or reviewing. The Mendix Developer Portal enables developers from both IT and business with mixed experience levels to collaborate.

To view and manage your App Team members, follow these steps:

1. Click **Apps** in the top navigation panel of the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) and select the app you want to manage.
2. Click **Team** under the **Collaborate** category.

On the **Team** page, you will see an overview with the following information about the App Team members:

* **Name** – the developer's name
* **Role** – the developer's App Team role (for details on available roles, see the [App Team Roles](/developerportal/company-app-roles/index#app-team-roles) section of *Company & App Roles*)
