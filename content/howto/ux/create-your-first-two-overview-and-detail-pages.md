## 4 Navigation and Security

1. Now create a navigation item for your overview page to start using it. For details on how to set up the navigation structure, see [How to Set Up the Navigation Structure](setting-up-the-navigation-structure).
2. If you switched on security for this application, you need to configure page access on both the overview and detail pages. For more information on configuring page access, see [How to Create a Secure App](../security/create-a-secure-app).
