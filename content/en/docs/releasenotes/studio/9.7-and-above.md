## 2022

### April 29th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.13.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.13/#9130).

#### Improvements

* We extended the expression language with four new tokens to make it very easy to evaluate against yesterday or tomorrow.
* We changed the **Return Value** category of the **Call Microflow** activity in microflows and workflows to **Output** for more consistency. 
* We added new video tutorials on how to build an app to the **Help & Learning** to enable you to learn how to use Studio faster. 
* With workflows being re-enabled and made generally available in Studio for apps in Mendix version 9.12.1 or above, we updated the upgrading     process for existing apps: 
  * If your app has Mendix version 9.6 or above and does **not** yet have workflows, you can upgrade automatically in Studio to Mendix 9.12.1 or above and start using workflows.
  * If your app has Mendix version 9.5.1 or above and has workflows (which were in Beta) enabled, your app can only be upgraded manually by a team member using Studio Pro. For information on how to upgrade the app, see [Migrate Workflow Apps](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/workflow-beta-migration/) in *Studio Pro Guide*. 

### April 14th, 2022

#### New Features

* Workflows are now fully available in Studio: workflow functionality is not in Beta anymore, so you can use your apps with workflows in production now. For more information on workflows and how to create them, see [Workflows](/studio/workflows/). 
* We added the Approval Flow wizard when you create a workflow. If your use case falls under approval process, for example, approving vacation days for your team, you can use the wizard to create the app automatically: you define data type, and the wizard sets up the rest, including a workflow, relevant pages, and navigation. For more information, see the [Creating a Workflow Using the Wizard](/studio/workflows/#wizard) section in *Workflows*. 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where security was not configured correctly in app templates that had Mendix SSO installed. As a result, users were not redirected to the correct login page when they published their apps.

### January 3rd, 2022 

#### New Features

This gives you a clear overview and helps keep your app up-to-date with the latest Mendix features, security, and bug fixes. For more information, see [Mendix Version & Add-Ons](/studio/settings-version-and-add-ons/).
