## 1 Introduction

The Mendix Marketplace is driven by contributions from members of the community who share the connectors, modules, and apps they have built with the Mendix Platform. This how-to shows how to add and update Marketplace content.

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Add new content and promotions to share in the Marketplace
* Update existing Marketplace content

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Familiarize yourself with the [Marketplace Overview](/appstore/overview/) and [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/overview/use-content/)

## 3 Adding New Marketplace Content {#adding}

To get started, click **Add Content** in the top bar of the Marketplace home screen. Follow the steps in the sections below to add and submit the content.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
<a id="draft"></a>On each page of the upload flow, click one of the following buttons:

* **Save Draft** to save the details you have entered so far to the draft (which you can access via the [My Drafts](/appstore/overview/my-marketplace/#my-drafts) link in the top bar)
* **Save & Continue** to go to the next page of the upload flow
{{% /alert %}}

### 3.1 General {#general}

On the **General** page,  you need to provide some details about your component. 

#### 3.1.1 Describing Your Content

Follow these steps to describe your content:

1. Select a **Content type** for your component. 

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}You can only set the content type in the initial version of your content. You cannot change this setting after the initial version is published.{{% /alert %}}

2. Select the location **Visibility** where you want to publish your component:

    * <a id="public"></a>**Public Marketplace (all Mendix users)** – your component will be available to the Mendix community
        * This content will have to be reviewed and approved by Mendix before it is available)
    * <a id="private"></a>**Private Marketplace (your company only)** – your content will receive the **Private** label and be available only via your [Company Content](/appstore/overview/my-marketplace/#company-content) page
        * Selected private content of a content group can also be made available to [content group guests](/appstore/overview/my-marketplace/#guests) for download
        * This content will not be reviewed by Mendix

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}You can only set the location in the initial version of your content. You cannot change this setting by updating the Marketplace component later.{{% /alert %}}
    
3. You can add one **Category** (up to three total) for your component. A category groups similar components or services together that share common characteristics, functions, or purposes. Categories make it easier for Marketplace users to find what they are looking for.
4. Enter a **Name** for your component.
5. Enter a **Description** of your component.

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}You can use rich text in the editor. However, using rich text at the beginning of the description is not recommended, as it will not get rendered properly. You should add a few lines of regular text before using rich text.{{% /alert %}}

#### 3.1.2 Providing License Details {#license}

Select the type of **License** you want applied to your app.

##### 3.1.2.1 Open-Source Software Licenses

{{% /alert %}}

##### 3.1.2.2 Proprietary Licenses {#proprietary-license}

You can configure your own proprietary license for your company’s content. The license can be used for multiple components, and it can be used by everyone within your organization. 

This license can be created for a new **Public Marketplace (all Mendix users)** component by requesting a new license and submitting it alongside the component. The license needs to be [approved by Mendix](/appstore/sharing-content/#guidelines) after you have created and submitted it the first time. Once it has been submitted for approval, you and the people within your organization can also use it it for other components.

Follow these steps to configure a proprietary license for a new public component:

1. Click **Request New License**.
2. Add a **License Name**, which is the name that will be displayed on the [component details page](/appstore/overview/#details).
3. Add a **License URL**, which should lead the user to a web page that lists the terms and conditions for using the component. Users can navigate to this web page by clicking the license name on the component details page.
4. Add a **Reason** for the new license. This is for the purpose of the Mendix review only, and it will not be displayed on the component details page.

#### 3.1.3 Generating New Leads {#lead-generation}

A lead is a potential sales contact that expresses interest in your product or service. Lead routing is the end-to-end process of collecting the leads and distributing them to you. It is possible to configure lead routing for the following content types in the Marketplace:

* Solutions
* Industry templates
* Services

When prospective customers are interested in your product, they can leave their contact information using the Marketplace product listing. This is done by clicking a call-to-action button and filling in a form.

You can configure the name of your **Main call-to-action** button from the following choices: 

* **Contact Us**, **Notify Me**, and **Request Demo** – requires the email address that will receive the customer information

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}If you choose to add one of these buttons, customers can contact you directly. If you start talking with the customer, it is your responsibility to provide access to the product for that customer. Mendix is not involved in such customer interactions. {{% /alert %}}

* **Download** – no lead routing is established, but customers can directly download your product.

In the **How would you like to receive information on new leads?** field, you must specify the email address (or addresses) where notifications and information can be sent.

#### 3.1.4 Finishing Up

To finish up configuring this page, click **Upload** to upload an icon for your component.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/sharing-content/general.png" >}}

### 3.2 Package {#package}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you are using **Solutions**, you will not see the option to select your content source. If you are using **Industry Template**, selecting a content source is optional.
{{% /alert %}}

On the **Package** page, you can **Upload Source File**: 

* If you select **Manual upload**, follow the steps in the dialog box for uploading the package source file
    * When you are finished, click **Save**
* If you select **GitHub URL**, follow the steps in the dialog box for copying the link of the release you want to import (for details, see the [Using a GitHub Repo](#github) section above)
    * To include the repo's *README.md* file on the component's [Documentation](#doc) tab, make sure you have checked the **Import Documentation** box 
    * When you are finished, click **OK**

Select the **Studio Pro Version** on which you built the content.

If this is the first version of the component you are uploading, the number in the **Version** section will be automatically set to **1.0.0**. 

Enter **Release Notes** for the component in the box provided describing what is new in that release.

### 3.3 Enable {#doc}

On the **Enable** page, you can enter details on requirements and configuration for your component in the **Documentation**. Note that the documentation option is only available when the **Import Documentation** box has not been selected on the **Package** page above. 

Follow the template for the recommended content:

* You must fill out the following sections in order to submit your component:
    * An extended **Description** of the component
    * The **Typical usage scenario** for the component
    * The **Features and limitations** of the component
* These sections are optional:
    * Any **Dependencies** (for example, the required Studio Pro version, modules, images, and styles)
    * The **Installation** steps and details
    * The **Configuration** steps and details
    * Any **Known bugs**
    * Any **Frequently asked questions**

The editor comes with a set of basic formatting tools, such as bold, bullet lists, and URL links.

<a id="screenshot"></a>Click **Upload Screenshot** to select images of the component (especially for configuration) from your computer and upload them (this is required for submitting a new component):

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/sharing-content/enable.png"  >}}

You can optionally add a **YouTube URL** and a **Demo URL**.

### 3.4 Capabilities {#capabilities}

On the **Capabilities** page, you can provide the following details about an industry template:

* A category recommendation in the **Industry Cloud** section
* A **Banner** that will be displayed on your content page
* One or more key features to leverage in the **Solution Capabilities** section (for each capability, enter a **Name** and **Description**)
* A **Use Case** relevant to the content (enter a **Header** and **CTA URL**)
* **External Links** relevant to the content

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/sharing-content/capabilities.png"  >}}

### 3.5 Publish {#publish}

Finally, on the **Publish** page, you can review all the details of your component you entered so far and edit as necessary (via the **Edit** button per section) before publishing.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/sharing-content/publish.png"   width="600"  >}}

After you click **Publish Content**, your draft will be reviewed by Mendix before it is visible in the Marketplace. 

For details on the approval process, see [Governance Process](/appstore/sharing-content/governance-process/).

## 4 Updating Existing Marketplace Content {#updating}

After you publish a component in the Mendix Marketplace, it is your responsibility to make sure that components are updated on a regular cadence. This is important so that components work with the latest versions of dependencies (especially Mendix Studio Pro), and it is required so Mendix can ensure the quality of components in the Marketplace. This means you need to monitor, maintain, and evolve the component so that the Marketplace listing is more noticeable, you can build user loyalty, and you can maintain the good reputation of your company. If the component is not updated regularly, the Marketplace listing will be analyzed for removal from public visibility.

Mendix expects the following updates for components in the Platform, Community, and Premium [support categories](/appstore/overview/#category):

* Bug fixes
* New features
* Feature removal
* Compatibility updates with the latest Studio Pro version and other dependencies

To update content that has already been published, follow these steps:

1. Find the component by clicking **My Marketplace** and selecting one of the following:
    * **My Content**
    * **Company Content**
    * **Content Groups** (note that if an existing Marketplace component is assigned to a [content group](/appstore/overview/my-marketplace/#content-groups) as specific content group [content](/appstore/overview/my-marketplace/#group-content), you can only update the component if you are a member of that group)

2. Click the menu item next to the component you want to update and select **Manage Draft**.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}Only one draft version of a component can exist at a time, so when one draft version is in progress, another draft cannot be started. If there is a draft version in progress, click **View draft** on the page where you manage the component in order to see the draft.{{% /alert %}}

3. You can edit all component details, as described in the [Adding New Marketplace Content](#adding) section above.
4. In the **Version** section of the **Package** page, update the **Major**, **Minor**, and **Patch** numbers so that the component is saved as a new version:

    * **Major update** – a large change (which will save the component from version 5.0 to version 6.0, for example)
    * **Minor update** – a medium-sized change (which will save the component from version 6.0.0 to version 6.1.0, for example)
    * **Patch** – a small change (which will save the component from 6.1.0 to 6.1.1, for example)

5. On the **Publish** page, you can review all the details of your component you entered so far and edit as necessary (via the **Edit Section** button) before clicking **Publish Content**.
