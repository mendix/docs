## 2022

### March _____, 2022

#### New Features

* Workflows are now fully available in Studio. You can use apps with Mendix version 9.11 or above to use improved workflow functionality. For more information on workflows and how to create them, see [Workflows](/studio/workflows). 
* We added the Approval Flow wizard when you create a workflow. If your use case falls under approval process, for example, approving vacation days for your team, you can use the wizard to create the app automatically: you define data type, and the wizard sets up the rest, including a workflow, relevant pages, and navigation. For more information, see the [Creating a Workflow Using the Wizard](/studio/workflows#wizard) section in *Workflows*.
