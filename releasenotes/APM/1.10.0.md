This is a release with multiple minor features.

There was a customer request to rename recorded sessions. This is now possible, as well as
renaming statistics tool snapshots. The performance and the statistics tool also show
details of the recording or snapshot and you can prevent a snapshot or recorded session from
being deleted by cleanup functionality. This last function also is applied to traps,
logs and triggered events.

Another customer asked if it was possible to collect information when a certain message
was logged. The trap tool works for errors (or optionally for warnings), but not for information
messages. Now you can define a pattern for an info message that triggers an event with
the same options as the triggers in the measurements or the statistics tool. The so called
message triggers.

The trigger log action now has a level. You can use this for critical messages and thus 
receive an email when you run in the Mendix cloud.

The trap tool now has a separate buffer for storing traps in memory that are written to
the database and a configuration of the maximum of records in the database. This helps you
to store more records in the database and run the trap tool with less impact on your system.
At the same time we fixed a bug in the traptool that left empty trap records when deleting
the oldest trap messages. Now the oldest trap gets completely deleted if the database limit
is reached.

The licensing mechanism is improved, so we can issue a one time code immediatly. When entering this
code in the 'license request code' field during the installation of APM a license key will
automatically be generated (24/7 within a minute given the license server is up)


Other fixes/improvements
*	Measurements decimal format to 2 decimals so the search in the measurements tool is more readable
*	Rename java parameter that gave issues in some Mx releases
*	Fix some mappings in OData
*	Improved sample data for measurements, queries, exclusions and a statistics trigger
*	Tester/Developer features like stats on console (as developer) and special pages are removed from APM Tool (and added to Task Manager APM Demo app)
*	Random ofset in measurement scheduled events to make sure they do not run at the very same time if they have the same frequency. Should spread usage and give better performance. In demoâ€™s with 5 licenses and more than 5 measurements this is noticeable.
*	Cleanup now runs at midnight
