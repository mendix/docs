The documentation in this section describes a new feature that is still in beta, and is subject to change before the final release.

We define an offline application as the portion of a Mendix app that is accessible through the [Offline device](Offline+device+profile) [profile](Navigation). Pages available in this profile can be viewed without an internet connection. Consequently, they are subject to a number of restrictions.

## Availability

To access the Offline device profile, you need to have a mobile device that runs a correctly configured [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) hybrid application. The app will require an internet connection the first time it is opened in order to download the necessary resources from the server. After the initial synchronization the data will remain available in the app, even without an internet connection. Please note that the offline profile will be used, whether or not an internet connection is actually available. Which profiles is used depends on the PhoneGap app settings, not the connection status of the device.

## Synchronization

The first time an [offline-enabled](Configuring+Hybrid+Mobile+Apps+To+Run+Offline) mobile application is run, it will retrieve all the data it requires to run offline from the server. After that, it will remain in offline mode until a synchronization event is triggered. Remaining in offline mode will significantly improve the performance of your application. Synchronization can be triggered by either the server or the user. The server will automatically resynchronize the app if it is opened after a new model is uploaded, to prevent inconsistencies. The user can trigger a sync by tapping a [sync button](Sync+button), which is available in the modeler. Lastly, the app will always attempt to synchronize if it is (re-)started. If you device is not connected to the internet during start-up, this step will be skipped.

During synchronization, any changed, created, and deleted objects will be applied to the offline database. Additionally, any objects created by the user since the application last synced will be uploaded to the server. The server will perform any relevant event handlers on these objects as usual. If the synchronization action encounters an error during this process, the entire upload process is reversed. For example, if ten objects are uploaded and one of these commits triggers a validation error, all ten objects are lost. This is to ensure that the internal consistency between your newly created objects is maintained. For example; if a user creates a Order with several Orderlines and the Order fails to commit, the entire transaction is rolled back to prevent your Orderlines from ending up in the database without an Order, thus corrupting your data.

## Restrictions

### Microflows

Without a server to process all the necessary logic, microflows run from the Mendix client cannot function in offline pages. This applies to any and all client-side microflows, from datasource microflows to on-change actions. Please note that all microflows run outside the scope of the client will still run. For instance, a before commit microflow can still be used to process complex logic, as long as the developer remains aware of the fact that it will be run on synchronization rather than initial save.

### XPath

The database used to store data on your mobile device for offline use does not support complex queries. As such, the XPath setting is disallowed on all widgets accessible through the offline device profile. Alternatively, the simple constraints found in the database data source can be used, as well as modeling complex queries using entity access.

### Data sources

Only the database datasource is allowed offline, due in part to the restrictions on both XPath and microflows described above.

### Search

Because our search behavior relies on database queries, searching it is currently not available to offline grids and list views.

### Data manipulation

To simplify the synchronization process, offline pages only support the creation of new objects. Objects imported from the online database can be viewed but not changed. Objects can only be edited in the period between creation and synchronization.

### Autonumbers and calculated attributes

Both autonumbers and calculated attributes require server intervention and are, as such, disallowed. Objects with these attribute types can still be viewed and created offline, but the attributes themselves cannot be displayed.

### Files

Storing and uploading files offline is not supported. Specializations of the System.FileDocument can still be created offline, but files cannot be uploaded or downloaded. The exception to this rule is System.Image, which can be accessed, viewed, and uploaded as usual with the image viewer and upload widgets. 

### Associations

With the exception of data views, list views, template grids, and data grids, data displayed over an association is prohibited. This applies to everything from a data grid column displaying data in an associated object to reference selectors. In most cases, the desired goal can still be achieved by filling a nested data view with the relevant association and filling it with the required widgets.

### Excel/CSV export

Spreadsheets are generated through direct database interaction, which is not available offline.

### Platforms

Offline enabled apps are only supported on the iOS and Android platforms.
