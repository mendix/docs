## 1 Introduction

Mendix can be found as starter kits in IBM Cloud and as IBM app templates when you create an app in the Mendix [Developer Portal](https://home.mendix.com/).

IBM has integrated the provisioning and deployment of Mendix apps directly to the IBM Cloud. More information on how to deploy your app is available in [IBM Cloud – Deployment](/developerportal/deploy/ibm-cloud).

In addition, Mendix has written a number of connectors to enable developers to work easily with IBM Watson.
