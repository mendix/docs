title: "Runtime"
---
The Mendix Runtime executes the model created in the Modeler. It serves pages to the [Client](client) and executes microflows, calls web services, generates documents, communicates with the database and much more.

## Licensing

You need a license to run an application in production mode. Without a license the Mendix Runtime stops operating after a couple of hours. A license can be obtained through your account manager at Mendix. Afterwards, you can activate your license by following the [activation manual](/howto40/activate-your-mendix-license).

## API

You can extend the functionality of the runtime by writing Java actions. The API available for Java programmers is available at [https://apidocs.mendix.com/4/runtime/](https://apidocs.mendix.com/4/runtime/).

## Logging

The runtime logs activity at different levels. You can read more about logging and log levels at the [Logging](logging) page.
