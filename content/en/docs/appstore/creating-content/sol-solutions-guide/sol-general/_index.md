## 1 Introduction

Mendix introduced the Solution Vendor Program to support the full range of organizations—from startups to large enterprises—looking to develop solutions. Under beneficial terms, Mendix provides independent software vendors (ISVs) and startups with a Mendix license for the development and operation of Mendix apps to implement solutions for their customers.

## 2 Programs

Mendix supports aspiring solutions vendors and startups in their adoption of Mendix as a development platform for their solutions. The Mendix Solution Vendor Program and Mendix Startup Program teams are the point of contact for any inquiries, including requesting access to early-adopter stage technologies like Intellectual Property Protection.
