## 1 Introduction

The widgets available in the Mendix Marketplace are single user-interface elements that can be configured, such as containers, drop-down menus, and buttons.

When you download these widgets, they will be available from the **Add widget** menu item on the [page editor](/refguide/page/) toolbar.

### 1.1 Widget CSP Overview

Currently, certain Mendix pluggable widgets are not fully compliant with strict content security policy (CSP). 

See the [Widget CSP Overview](/appstore/widgets/security/content-security-policy/) guide to learn how to make pluggable widgets compliant with CSP. Each one has slightly different requirements, which are explained in the widgets' respective CSP pages.

To implement a CSP for the first time, see this [Content Security Policy](/howto/security/csp/) how-to.
