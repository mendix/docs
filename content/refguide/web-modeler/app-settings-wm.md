The following types of widgets are included into the widget overview of the App Settings:

* App Store widgets that are Web Modeler approved, which are either, widgets that have been added by default when you created your app, or widgets you can download from the [App Store](/developerportal/app-store/) to your project directly from the Web Modeler (for more information on widgets, see [Widgets in the Web Modeler](page-editor-widgets-wm))
* Local widgets – widgets created by users in the Desktop Modeler (you can create local widgets yourself via the Desktop Modeler, for more information, see [Custom Widget Development](../../howto/custom-widget-development/))

In the App Settings the following columns are displayed:

| Column            | Description                                                  |
