## 1 Introduction

[Mendix Data Hub](https://hub.mendix.com) helps you integrate app development with the data available from the many applications in an organization. Data Hub enables reliable data sources to be located centrally from one point and for users to connect to them through it. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The Data Hub integration is available in Studio Pro version [8.14](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.14/) and above. To use the latest functionality of Data Hub, download the latest version of [Studio Pro](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/). {{% /alert %}}

## 2 Overview of Mendix Data Hub

Mendix Data Hub has components to enable the flexible sharing of datasets:

1. Published apps and other software expose datasets in OData services. The data is maintained in the respective source apps.
2. In Studio Pro, exposed OData services (or entity sets as they are named in Studio Pro) are automatically registered in the [Data Hub Catalog](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/) when your app is deployed. OData services from other applications can also be manually registered in the Data Hub Catalog.
3. Search in the Data Hub Catalog or **Data Hub** pane in Studio Pro to find shared data assets to use.
4. Drag and drop to consume datasets in Studio Pro.  
5. The consuming application directly connects to the source system (as defined in the published service metadata) to use the data associated with the consumed dataset.

## 3 Roles in Data Hub {#data-hub-roles}

Shared datasets can be curated to ensure that resources can be found by the right users while maintaining their security. The Data Hub Catalog contains only metadata, not data.

This section describes the general Data Hub user as well as the assigned [Mendix Admin](#admin) and [Data Hub Curator](#curator) roles.

### 3.1 Data Hub Users

The typical Mendix user is able to use the Data Hub Catalog to search and consume registered OData services. Users can also register new services, and as owners, curate them.

Data Hub users can do the following: 

* Publish services and register them in the Data Hub Catalog from Studio Pro
* Register published OData V4 Services for non-Mendix apps manually
* Update the metadata such as descriptions, tags, contact information, and discoverability of their own registered services
* See all the discoverable services and datasets registered in their organization’s Data Hub Catalog and connect to the data by using the published entities as external entities in their apps in the Mendix Studios

### 3.2 Mendix Admin {#admin}

A Mendix Admin can do the following:

* Act as a [Mendix Admin](/developerportal/control-center/data-hub-admin/) of the organization’s Data Hub
* Assign [Data Hub Curator](#curator) roles
* Curate the Data Hub according to the organization's data governance policy
* Access all the registered assets in the Data Hub Catalog for the organization

For more information, see the [Data Hub](/developerportal/control-center/#data-hub) section of *Control Center*. 

### 3.3 Data Hub Curator {#curator}

The Data Hub Curator curates registered services in the Data Hub Catalog to ensure that registered services are visible to the relevant users and to enrich the information on registered assets. An organization can have several Data Hub Curators. 

Curators are assigned by the a [Mendix Admin](#admin) and can enrich the metadata of registered services and datasets – for example descriptions, tags, contact information, and discoverability

## 4 Data Hub Licenses {#data-hub-licences}

There are two types of licenses for Mendix Data Hub: Data Hub Free and Data Hub Premium.

All Mendix users have access to the Data Hub Free edition. With this, you can retrieve or edit 1000 objects per application per day for each runtime instance when deployed. When that limit is exceeded, you get an error when your applications tries to retrieve more data. For more information, see the [Data Hub License Limitations](/refguide/consumed-odata-service-requirements/#license-limitations) section of *Consumed OData Service Requirements*.

With the Data Hub Premium license, apps are not limited. They can retrieve and edit an unlimited number of objects.

Contact your [Mendix Admin](/developerportal/control-center/#company) to find out what type of Data Hub license your organization has.
