## 3.1.3

**Release date: March 2nd, 2020**

### Fixes

* We fixed a memory issue. The Android template now uses use a larger heap by default to accommodate for memory-heavy tasks.
* We fixed an issue where the Android template crashed when the maps widget was used but the API key had not been configured yet. The Android app no longer crashes in this case.

## 3.1.2

**Release date: February 19th, 2020**

### Fix

* We fixed an issue in iOS apps where OTA updates did not trigger correctly, and therefore did not update apps.
  
## 3.1.1

**Release date: February 6th, 2020**

### Fix

* We fixed an issue where dynamic images would not sync correctly in iOS apps. This issue resulted in images missing from pages and a pop-up window. This problem cannot be resolved with an OTA update. Triggering a full build of your iOS app will fix this issue.

## 3.1.0

**Release date: February 5th, 2020**

### Improvements

* The MendixNative library and [Native Template](https://github.com/mendix/native-template) are now written in Objective C. With this update we are closing the gap between the Native Template and the React Native starter template. 
* We added support for push notifications in the Native Template. As soon as you include a Google services configuration file (GoogleService-Info.plist* and *google-services.json*) in your app, the Native Template will enable the required libraries automatically.
* We added support for URL Schemes.

### Fixes

* We fixed bridging headers so that they work as intended.
* We fixed Swift compiler incompatibilities.
* We fix the React Native `link` command so that it works as intended.

## 3.0.0 

**Release date: January 10th, 2020**

### New Feature

* We added support for generating custom developer applications. When your app uses custom assets and outgrows the Make It Native testing app, you will need a custom developer app. To make a custom developer app, see [How to Create a Custom Developer App](/howto/mobile/how-to-devapps).

## 2.1.0 

**Release date: December 17th, 2019**

### Improvement

## 2.0.2

**Release date: November 25th, 2019**
