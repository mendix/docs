If you run the app and log in as a user with the Administrator role, you can see the new page in the navigation.

## Using Supporting Microflows with Mendix SSO                                                               {#use-with-mendix-sso}

The [Administration](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/23513) module versions 1.3.X (for example 1.3.2) and 2.1.X (for example 2.1.2) contain a set of microflows to configure Mendix SSO to use **Administration.Account** as the user entity. To use the supporting microflows with Mendix SSO, perform the following steps:

1. Make sure that your app contains the Mendix SSO module. If it does not, import the [Mendix SSO](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/111349) module from the Marketplace.

2. Configure the **MendixSSO_AfterStartup** microflow from the Administration module as the [after startup](/refguide/app-settings/#after-startup) microflow. If there is already an after startup microflow, do not replace it, but add the **MendixSSO_AfterStartup** microflow as a sub-microflow in the existing microflow.

{{% alert color="info" %}}If you previously used the Mendix SSO in your application, use the **MendixSSO_MigrateUsersToAccount** microflow to migrate users from the `MendixSSOUser` to the `Administration.Account` specialization. Before executing the migration, carefully read the instructions in the microflow.{{% /alert %}}
