Mendix uses visual models to define the logic of your application, we call those models Microflows. A Microflow is a visual way of expressing what traditionally would be written in code. This how-to explains how you can create a very simple 'Hello World' Microflow.

## 1\. Creating a Menu Item

Microflows can be triggered in many different ways, as explained [here](Triggering+Logic+using+Microflows). For this how-to you'll be using a menu item to trigger the new Microflow.

1.  Open the **navigation editor** and add a menu item in the desktop navigation settings.

2.  Enter a caption like _Hello World_.
3.  Click **Select...** at the Target section to open the navigation target selector.

4.  Select a module and click the **New** button.

5.  Click **Create a microflow** to connect a new Microflow to this menu item.
6.  Name the Microflow _HelloWorld_.
7.  Save the new menu item by clicking **OK**.

## 2\. Edit the New Microflow

1.  To open the new Microflow, right click the navigation item created in the previous step and select **Go to target** from the context menu.![](attachments/8784287/8946315.png)

    You should see an empty Microflow like this:

2.  Open the toolbox. It should be on the bottom right of the Business Modeler.

3.  If you can't find the toolbox, you can re-open it from the view menu.

4.  Drag a **Show Message** action from the toolbox to the line between the green start and red end event. This inserts a show message action activity.

7.  Run the application locally and click **View App** to see the application in your default browser.
