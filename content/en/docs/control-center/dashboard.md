These are some examples of what you can find on the dashboard:

* **Apps Created** – you can filter these [apps](/control-center/apps/) by date
* **Mendix Versions** – describes which Studio Pro/Mendix versions your internal and external [members](/control-center/members/) are using for apps, which is especially important as the development of apps on outdated or [non-MTS/LTS versions](/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/) can lead to security issues
* **Certification Level** – presents the number of members per [Mendix certification](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certification)
* **External Members** – click a part of this pie chart to see a list of external members from a specific company
* **Company Feed** – presents events in your company, such as members joining the company and the created app
