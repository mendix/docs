## 1 Introduction 

To make sure that your app is always consistent and properly built, Studio Pro does consistency checks when you build your app. When a consistency check is not met, Studio Pro will notify you about this via consistency errors on the **Errors** tab.

Errors need to be solved before your app can be published. A consistency error can occur in the following editors or functionalities of Studio Pro:

* [Pages](consistency-errors-pages) 
* [Navigation](consistency-errors-navigation) 
* [Microflows](microflows)
* [Domain Model](domain-model)
* [Integration](integration)
* [Security](security)
