The day-of-year-from-dateTime() function extracts the amount of days (in the year) from a DateTime attribute so it can be used to compare to a value. Values range from 1 to 366 (due to leap years)

```
//Logging.Log[day-of-year-from-dateTime(DateAttribute) = 30]

```

This query returns all Logs where the amount of days (in the year) in DateAttribute is 30, for example 2011-01-30\.
