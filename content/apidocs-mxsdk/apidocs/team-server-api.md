## Introduction

The team server API allows you to retrieve the information (branches, revisions) of application models stored in our team server. You always access an application model via the context of an application (see the Deploy API for more information about retrieving applications and application identifiers).
The image below provides a domain model representation of the concepts discussed below and how these are related:

## Authentication

The Developer Portal Management API requires its users to authenticate themselves. This can be done by using API keys; for more information about this please refer to [this article](authentication "authentication").
