This image viewer shows the product image.

An image viewer must be placed in a table cell inside a data view or template grid.

## Appearance Properties

### Height

This property determines the height of the image. See width (above) for more information.

### Show as thumbnail

This property indicates whether the generated thumbnail is shown or the full image.

_Default value:_ True

### Microflow (in the case 'Call microflow')
