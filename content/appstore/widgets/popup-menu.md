## 1 Introduction

The [Pop-Up Menu](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/) widget shows a floating menu with items. The widget allows users to create their own items in "custom" mode.

### 1.1 Features

* Add your own trigger element
* Change the menu's position
* Show the menu on-hover or on-click
* Change the style of each item
* Attach an on-click action to each item
* Create your own custom items

## 2 Usage

Place the widget anywhere you want on a page in your app.

If you want to use dynamic content, make sure to wrap the widget in a [data view](/refguide/data-view) and configure the widget as **Render = Custom**.
