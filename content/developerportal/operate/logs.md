The page is accessed through the **Logs** page under the **Operate** category:

You may be asked to provide your SAP credentials before you can see the log in Kibana.

The Kibana user guide is available here: [Kibana User Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html) and within Kibana. More information on how Kibana is integrated with SAP Cloud Platform is available on the SAP help site here: [Application Logging for the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ee8e8a203e024bbb8c8c2d03fce527dc/Cloud/en-US/68454d44ad41458788959485a24305e2.html).

{{% alert type="info" %}}For apps deployed to environments created before 22 October 2018, the *Application Logging (application-logs)* service will not have been bound to your app automatically. To resolve this you can either:

1. Create a new environment and deploy your app there.

2. Bind the service to your existing app by:

    * Going to the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit
    * Going to the space for your environment
    * Finding *Application Logging* in the Service Marketplace
    * Going to *Instances*
    * Creating a *New Instance* and following the instructions, ensuring that you bind it to your app
    * Stopping and starting the app
