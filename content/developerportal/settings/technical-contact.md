## 1 Introduction
This document describes the role of the technical contact within the Mendix application domain.

## 2 What Is a Technical Contact?

The person responsible for a Mendix application on a technical level.

## 3 Who Is the Technical Contact of My Application?

A Mendix application will always be set up and delivered with a technical contact connected to it. The assignment of the contact takes place when the order is signed. The technical contact needs a *MendixID* before Mendix can deliver the app. You get a MendixID when you create a Mendix account.

## 4 What Can I Expect As a Technical Contact?

This depends on the type of hosting for your app: On-Premises or Mendix Cloud.

### 4.1 On-Premises (The Mendix App Runs on the Customer's Own Infrastructure)

Managing licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix will send license renewal notifications to the technical contact via email
* If the technical contact would like to expand the license (e.g. more users), they need to contact their Account Executive

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes and incidents.

### 4.2 Mendix Cloud

You are the first point of contact for the app:

*   You will receive notifications for maintenance from Mendix Support
*   You will be able to receive alerts from the Mendix application when problems arise (CPU Load is high/running out of disk space)
*   You can configure the alert settings in the Monitoring tab of the cloud node.
*   If problems arise (for example, when the app is down)

You can manage the Mendix application in the Mendix Cloud ([cloud.mendix.com](http://cloud.mendix.com)):

* Deploy the model, stop/star the app, monitor the app, connect a project to the node, check log files, manage the access rights of team members, and more
* The Technical Contact can also provide access rights to project members so they can also perform the above tasks

Licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix is responsible for Mendix Cloud app renewals
* Contact your Account Executive if you want to expand the license

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes and incidents.

## 5. Can We Change the Technical Contact?

Yes, the technical contact can be changed in the Mendix Cloud.

## 6. Can We Have More Than One Technical Contact?

It is currently not possible to select more than one Technical Contact in the Mendix Cloud.

For On-Premises installations it is possible to select more than one contact. Contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com) with your request.
