## 1 Introduction

Design patterns are implementation patterns for machine learning models. The documents in this section explore [Advanced Inference Design Patterns](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/design-patterns/advanced-inference/) and [Pre-Processor and Post-Processor Design Patterns](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/design-patterns/pre-post-processor-patterns/) in further detail.

For detailed information on working with machine learning models in Studio Pro, see [Integrate Machine Learning Models](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/).
