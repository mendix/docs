## 1 Introduction

This reference guide will contextualize the style elements Mendix uses in native mobile apps, as well as explain the classes and style properties of Mendix’s widgets. To learn the basics of native styling, you can consult [How to Implement Native Mobile Styling](/howto8/mobile/native-styling/) and then follow [How to Style Your Mendix Native Mobile App](/howto8/mobile/how-to-use-native-styling/).

Mendix apps use layouts to dictate how pages can look and function. For native mobile apps specifically, you can use a native layout to easily integrate navigation and settings optimized for native functionality. For more information on layouts, see [Layout](/refguide8/layout/).

To keep widgets responsive, Mendix apps use Flexbox. Using Flexbox, a component can set the layout of its child components. This allows your app to retain a consistent layout across multiple form factors. For more information on layout, see React Native’s [Flexbox documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).

You can use the `height` and `width` properties to set a widget component’s dimensions. For more information on size, see React Native’s [Height and Width documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/height-and-width).

## 2  Style Objects {#style-objects}

A widget is composed of various elements, and each can be styled individually. You can customize your widgets using style objects. A style object is a JavaScript object with a set of attributes specific for each widget. Some of the attributes reuse properties of other elements, such as React Native’s ViewStyle, TextStyle, ImageStyle, and Colors elements. You can consult the following property sets for more information on styling properties as you customize your app:

* **ViewStyle** – React Native’s [View Style](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props) property set helps you alter borders, opacity, and other general aspects of your app (the view style property set also contains layout, shadow, and transform properties)
* **TextStyle** – React Native’s [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props) property set will allow you to style text – using these props you can control text’s font, selection status, and more (the text property set also contains layout properties)
* **ImageStyle** – React Native’s [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image-style-props) property set will allow you to style images from network sources, a local library, and temporary local images – using these properties you can alter an image’s size, border, and more, while the image property set also contains layout properties (the `resizeMode` value `repeat` is not supported)
* **Colors** – React Native’s [Color Reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors) property set will allow you to alter colors – you can customize colors using red-green-blue notation, change hue or saturation, and more 

### 2.1  Class Names

Each style object has a name, referred to as the object’s class name. You can create new custom classes, and then apply styling to a single widget by setting a class name onto a widget class property. Here you can see the code for creating a `customClassName`:

```javascript
// A custom styling class
export const customClassName = {
	container: {
		// ViewStyle properties
		paddingTop: 5
	},
	text: {
		// TextStyle properties
		fontWeight: "bold"
	}
}
```

That custom class can be easily accessed in Mendix Studio Pro:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/custom-class.png" alt="custom class"   width="400"  >}}

When you want to apply styling to one instance of a widget, you can extend that widget’s default class. Each widget's default class is named in the [Data Widgets](#understanding-data-widgets) section below. The example below shows how to extend a default class:

```javascript
export const ActionButton = {
	container: {
		// ViewStyle properties
		borderWidth: 3
	},
	caption: {
		// TextStyle properties
		fontSize: 20
	},
};
```

Add-on widgets each have their own default styling classes based on their full widget IDs (found in *{widget name}.xml*), and can be created by replacing the dots with underscores. The example below shows a pluggable widget’s default styling class:

```javascript
export const com_mendix_widget_native_badge_Badge = (Badge = {
	text: {
		// TextStyle properties
		color: "#00FF00",
	}
});
```

For more information on creating your own classes, see the [Creating Your Own Classes](/howto8/mobile/how-to-use-native-styling/#creating-your-own-classes) section in *Style Your Mendix Native Mobile App*. That document also shows how to use custom classes as design properties.

## 3  Data Widgets {#understanding-data-widgets}

Data widgets are essential to many Mendix apps. These widgets will allow your users to create and handle data objects, and can be customized to fit your app’s needs.

### 3.1 Data View Widget

The data view widget shows the contents of one data object. For more information about this widget, see [Data View](/refguide8/data-view/).This widget has no user interface, so it does not support any styling.

### 3.2 List View Widget {#list-view}

The list view shows a list of objects arranged vertically or horizontally. For more information about this widget, see [List View](/refguide8/list-view/). This is not the default list view, but how a list view widget could look in an app:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/list-view.png" alt="list view"   width="350"  >}}

This is how the widget’s code is structured:

```xml
<container>
	<listItem>content</listItem>
	<listItem>content</listItem>
</container>
```

The widget’s style properties are as follows:

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | All ViewStyle properties |       |
| `container` | `numColumns` | This is the number of columns that the list should render (defaults to 1). |
| `listItem`  | All ViewStyle properties |          |
| `listItem`  | `rippleColor` | This is the color of the ripple on Android, and will be applied only when the item has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored (defaults to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`). |
| `listItem`  | `underlayColor` | This is the color while pressing the item on iOS, and will be applied only when the item has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored and defaulted to opacity only. |
| `listItemDisabled`  | Same properties as `listItem` | Overrides `listItem` styles if the item has an on click action and the action cannot be executed or is disabled during action. |

The default class to style all list views is named `ListView`.

## 4 Common Widgets

Common widgets are used in almost all app pages. Because of their ubiquity, learning to style common widgets will make a large difference for your apps.

### 4.1 Text

The text widget shows text which can optionally contain parameters. For more information on these widgets, see [Text Widgets](/refguide8/text/). The widget’s style properties are as follows:

```xml
<container>
	<text>content</text>
</container>
```

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | This has all ViewStyle properties. |                 |
| `text`      | This has all TextStyle properties. |                 |

The default class to style all texts is named `Text`.

### 4.2 Image {#image}

The image widget can be used to show a predefined image on a page, layout, or snippet. For more information on these widgets, see [Image Widgets](/refguide8/image/). The widget’s style properties are as follows:

```xml
<container>
	<image/>
</container>
```

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | This has all ViewStyle properties.  |       |
| `container`  | `rippleColor` | This is the color of the ripple on Android, and will be applied only when the container has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored (defaults to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`). |
| `container`  | `underlayColor` | This is the color while pressing the container on iOS, and will be applied only when the container has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored and defaulted to opacity only. |
| `containerDisabled` | Same properties as `container` | Overrides `container` styles if the image has an on click action and the action cannot be executed or is disabled during action. |
| `image`     | This has all ImageStyle properties. |       |
| `imageDisabled` | Same properties as `image` | Overrides `image` styles if the image has an on click action and the action cannot be executed or is disabled during action. |

The default class to style all static image styles is named `Image`. Please note that images loaded from the model are styled with `ImageViewer` as described in the [Image Viewer](#image-viewer) section below.

### 4.3 Page Title 

The page title widget shows the title of the page on which it is used. This can be the title defined on the page itself, or the override title defined when showing a page. For more information on this widget, consult [Page Title](/refguide8/page-title/). The widget’s style properties are as follows:

```xml
<container>
	<text>Page Title</text>
</container>
```

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | This has all ViewStyle properties. |                 |
| `text`      | This has all TextStyle properties. |                 |

The default class to style all page titles is named `PageTitle`.

### 4.4 Layout Grid

The layout grid widget can be used to structure the content on your page. You are able to create rows and columns which you can configure to have fixed or dynamic sizing.

The widget’s style properties are divided over several objects: `LayoutGrid`, `row`, `noGuttersRow`, `col`, `colFitToContent`, `col1`, `col2`, `col3`, `col4`, `col5`, `col6`,  `col7`, `col8`, `col9`, `col10`, `col11`, `col12`, and `noGutters`.

`col` is being applied when the Width property on a column is "Auto-fill".

`colFitToContent` is being applied when the Width property on a column is "Auto-fit content".

`col1`, `col2`, `col3`, `col4`, `col5`, `col6`,  `col7`, `col8`, `col9`, `col10`, `col11`, `col12` are applied when the Width on a column property is "Manual". Only one class is applied based on the related Size property.

`noGuttersRow` (Row) and `noGutters` (Column) are being applied when the Spacing between columns property on a row is set to "No".

The main `LayoutGrid`:

```xml
<container></container>
```

The `row`, `noGuttersRow`:

```xml
<container></container>
```

The `col`, `colFitToContent`, `col1`, `col2`, `col3`, `col4`, `col5`, `col6`,  `col7`, `col8`, `col9`, `col10`, `col11`, `col12`, `noGutters`:

```xml
<container></container>
```

The resulting DOM looks like this:

```xml
<container>
	<row>
		<col></col>
	</row>
</container>
```

## 5 Container Widgets

### 11.25 Carousel

The carousel widget allows you to show swipeable items in a carousel.

The widget’s style properties are as follows:

```xml
</container>
<cardLayout>
    </slideItem>
    </inactiveSlideItem>
    </indicator>
    <pagination>
        </container>
        </dotStyle>
        </inactiveDotStyle>
        </dotContainerStyle>
        </text>
    </pagination>
</cardLayout>
<fullWidthLayout>
    </slideItem>
    </inactiveSlideItem>
    </indicator>
    <pagination>
        </container>
        </dotStyle>
        </inactiveDotStyle>
        </dotContainerStyle>
        </text>
    </pagination>
</fullWidthLayout>
```

Main object has to have three objects called `container`, `cardLayout`, and `fullWidthLayout`. `cardLayout` and `fullWidthLayout` will be applied automatically depending on selected layout in widget properties.

```
export myCarouselStyle = {
    container: ViewStyle  //
    cardLayout: ...LayoutStyle,
    fullWidthLayout: ...LayoutStyle
}
```
