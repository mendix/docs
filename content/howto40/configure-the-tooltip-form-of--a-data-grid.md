This form should be a data view on the same entity as the reference set selector.

 **Finally, the columns for which the tooltip form appears when the mouse hovers over them have to be configured. To do this, select a column you want to tooltip form to appear for, and in the Properties window use the drop down menu to set 'Show tooltip' to 'True'.**
