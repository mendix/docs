## 1 Introduction

Studio Pro supports a unique approach to machine learning (ML) model integration in Mendix apps. Collectively called the *Machine Learning (ML) Kit*, this functionality allows Mendix developers to deploy a machine learning model built using common ML framework and language into the Mendix Runtime.

{{% alert color="info" %}}Check out a demo app and Jupyter notebook examples in our [Demo for Mendix ML Kit](https://github.com/mendix/mlkit-example-app) repository for further information on working with machine learning models in Mendix.{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Under the Hood {#ml-kit-hood}

Mendix *ML Kit* is built with the Open Neural Network Exchange ([ONNX](https://onnx.ai/)), an open source framework [co-developed by Microsoft and Facebook](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-and-facebook-create-open-ecosystem-for-ai-model-interoperability/) to enable framework interoperability. ONNX is an open standard format representing machine learning models. Models trained with various frameworks, from scikit-learn to PyTorch or TensorFlow, can be converted to ONNX.

The ONNX Runtime is based on the ONNX standard, and is an optimized inference engine for efficiently running any model converted to the ONNX format across different hardware and operating systems with minimum effort. Due to this framework interoperability nature of ONNX, ONNX Runtime improves the development efficiency from model training to inference. With the ML Kit, we have extended the Mendix Runtime with ONNX Runtime. ONNX bridges the gap between AI frameworks and Mendix.

To get started, see [Converting Your Model to ONNX](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/using-ml-kit/#convert-ml-model) in *Using ML Kit*.

## 3 Work with ML Kit
