## 1 Introduction

Mendix Studio Pro is the tool for creating, viewing, and editing your Mendix applications. A Mendix app is called a [project](project) in Studio Pro. A project consists of many documents that are grouped in [modules](modules) and folders. There are some project-level settings, but the core of the functionality is inside the modules. Examples of documents are [project settings](project-settings), [domain models](domain-model), [pages](pages), and [microflows](microflows). One Studio Pro instance can have only one project open at a time, but you can open two Studio Pro instances when necessary.

This documentation describes the graphical user interface of Studio Pro. The rest of the documentation follows the structure of the project explorer.

## 2 Document Tabs

The documents you view and edit are shown in tabs. You can have a number of tabs open, just like in a modern web browser. They can be closed, reordered, and shown side by side. Each document has its own save state, history, and future, so undo and redo actions are unlimited.

## 3 File Menu {#menus}

## 5 View Menu {#view}

### 5.1 Dockable Window Pane Menu Items {#dockable-panes}

Studio Pro supports a number of dockable window panes. You can close some panes to just show the ones you need at the moment, but you can always reopen them via the **View** menu. 

#### 5.1.1 Changes {#changes}

For [Team Server](/developerportal/develop/team-server) app projects, this pane shows the local changes to the app project since the last commit. You can commit changes, update to the latest revision, and view the history from here. 

This pane has two levels, so when you zoom into a changed document, you can review all the changes within that document without going back and forth between levels. The zoomed-in level of the pane is split into two grids, with elements on the left and properties on the right. Selecting an element on the left presents the changed properties on the right. To go back to the list of changed documents, click **Back**.

#### 5.1.2 Connector

This pane displays elements that can be connected to the currently selected element. For example, when a button is a selected, the **Connector** shows microflows that you can drag onto the button to connect them.

#### 5.1.3 Console {#console}

This pane displays the output of the [Mendix Runtime](runtime) while running an application.

#### 5.1.4 Documentation

This pane displays the documentation for the currently selected element (if applicable).

#### 5.1.5 Error List

The [**Errors** pane](errors-pane) displays the [errors](consistency-errors), warnings, and deprecations that exist in your app project.

#### 5.1.6 Find Results

This pane displays the results of the latest find action. You can search for text, usages of an element (for example, an attribute), and unused items.

There are two **Find Results** panes. If you lock the results of the first pane, the second one is used for subsequent find operations until you unlock the first one.

#### 5.1.7 Project Explorer

The [Project Explorer](project-explorer) pane displays the complete structure of your app project, including all the documents inside the modules. By default, the active document is always selected, so you can quickly see where the document you are editing is in the tree. You can change this behavior in **Edit** > [Preferences](preferences-dialog).

#### 5.1.8 Properties

This pane displays the properties of the currently selected element. This is where a lot of editing in Studio Pro takes place.

#### 5.1.9 Stories

For [Team Server](/developerportal/develop/team-server) app projects, this pane shows the [stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories) of the current [Sprint](/developerportal/develop/planning-development)

#### 5.1.10 Toolbox

This pane displays the tools that can be used in the current editor. For example, in a page you can insert all kinds of widgets (for example, [data widgets](data-widgets)) by dragging them from the **Toolbox** to your page.

#### 5.1.11 Debug Windows

For more information on debugging, see [How to Debug Microflows](/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows).

##### 5.1.11.1 Breakpoints

This pane shows all the breakpoints in your app project. You can enable and disable breakpoints from here.

##### 5.1.11.2 Debugger

This tool can be used to debug your application.

##### 5.1.11.3  Variables

In this pane, you can view the current values of variables, lists, and objects when debugging your application.
