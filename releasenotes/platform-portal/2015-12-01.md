## Bug fixes

*   The Mendix Cloud switched from the Jetty blocking I/O connector to a selector based non-blocking I/O connector for all applications. Due to a bug in the blocking I/O connector HTTP requests could be fired multiple times for long-running (> 2 minutes) requests, which would result in strange results in the Mendix Debugger (ticketÂ 462699). If you want to apply this fix you can simply restart your application.
*   Fixed bug that occurs when a which contains a large SVN directory is exposed into an Online Working Copy using Mendix Platform SDK.
