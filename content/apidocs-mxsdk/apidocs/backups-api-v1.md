description: "An API to allow the triggering of backups creation, restore, download and to get information about existing snapshots."

## 1 Introduction

The Backups API allows you to manage data snapshots of applications hosted in the Mendix Cloud. Data snapshots consist of a Postgresql database dump and file objects referenced from the database. You can create new snapshots, and restore or download them. Uploading snapshots is currently only supported via the [Developer Portal](/developerportal/operate/backups).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
This documents version 1 of the backups API. A new [V2 API](backups-api) is available which uses asynchronuous operations of long-running tasks.

## 2 Authentication

The Backups API requires authentication via API keys that are bound to your Mendix account (for more information, see [Deploy Authentication](deploy-api#authentication)). In addition to the **API Access** permission, the **Backups** permission is also required to manage backups.

### 3.3 Create a Backup of an Environment (Mendix Cloud v4 Only)

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
This call will trigger the creation of a snapshot and will return the **SnapshotID** immediately. However, the creation of the snapshot takes some time and if the creation hasn't completed you will get a **500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR** response from a request to download the backup (see above). In this case, it is recommended that you periodically retry downloading the backup until the call is successful.
{{% /alert %}}
