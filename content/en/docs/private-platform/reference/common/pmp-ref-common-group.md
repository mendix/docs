## Introduction

The **Manage My Group** page enables users with the Group Admin role to manage the membership of their user groups. The left navigation menu lists all groups managed by this admin.

The page shows a list of members for a particular group. Group admins can use it to add and remove members, or search for Platform users by their name or email and add them to the group.
