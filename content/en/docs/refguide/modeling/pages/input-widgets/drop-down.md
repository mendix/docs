The drop-down widget is not compatible with the modern version of the Mendix React Client. Depending on your app version, you may wish to convert the widget to a combo box widget using the context menu in Studio Pro. 

For more information on converting a drop-down widget into its more modern combo box counterpart, see the Mendix React Client's [Migration Guide](/refguide/mendix-client/react/#migration-guide).

## 1 Introduction

A **drop-down** is used to display and, optionally, allow the end-user to edit the value of an attribute of [data type](/refguide/data-types/) *enumeration*.

A drop-down must be placed in a [data container](/refguide/data-widgets/) and displays an attribute of the object (or objects) retrieved by that container. The name of the attribute to be displayed is shown inside the drop-down, between square brackets, and colored blue.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
A drop-down should not be confused with a [reference selector](/refguide/reference-selector/), which is used to select an [association](/refguide/associations/) to another object.

For example, the following drop-down allows the end-user to see, and set, the **Region** to which a customer is allocated. The possible values for **Region** are held in an enumeration.

## 2 Properties Pane

The properties pane is divided into two major sections by a toggle at the top of the pane: **Properties** and **Styling**. Drop-down properties consist of the following sections:

Properties:

* [General](#general)
* [Data source](#data-source)
* [Label](#label)
* [Editability](#editability)
* [Visibility](#visibility)
* [Validation](#validation)
* [Accessibility](#accessibility)
* [Common](#common)
* [Events](#events)

Styling:

* [Design Properties](#design-properties)
* [Common](#common-styling)

## 3 Properties

### 3.1 General Section{#general}

#### 3.1.1 Empty Option Caption

Empty option caption is the text that is shown for the empty option in the drop-down shown to the end-user. This is a translatable text. For more details, see [Language Menu](/refguide/translatable-texts/).

Adding a caption for the empty option improves the user experience of your application. It also helps end-users using a screen-reader to operate the application easily.

For example, the drop-down that allows the end-user to select the region allocated to a customer, where the possible values for **Region** are held in an enumeration, could have the caption `Select a region`.

### 3.8 Common Section{#common}

{{% snippet file="/static/_includes/refguide/common-section-link.md" %}}

### 3.9 Events Section{#events}

#### 3.9.1 On Change{#on-change}

The on-change property specifies an action that will be executed when leaving the widget, either by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or by clicking another widget, after the value has been changed.

{{% snippet file="/static/_includes/refguide/events-section-link.md" %}}

#### 3.9.2 On Enter

The on-enter property specifies an action that will be executed when the widget is entered, either by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or by clicking it with the mouse.

#### 3.9.3 On Leave

The on-leave property specifies an action that will be executed when leaving the widget, either by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or by clicking another widget.

This differs from the [On change](#on-change) property in that the event will always be triggered, even if the value has not been changed.
