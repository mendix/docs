## 1 Introduction

This guide explains the options for configuring chart widgets. The chart widgets are included in Mendix app templates based on Atlas UI. They can be included in other Mendix apps by downloading them from the Mendix App Store here: https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/105695/.

This guide covers the following widgets:

* Area chart
* Bar chart
* Bubble chart
* Column chart
* Heat map
* Line chart
* Pie chart
* Time series
  * Note that some apps may have two *Time series* widgets. This document refers to the one with this icon: ![Image of correct Time series widget](attachments/pages/charts/time-series-icon.png)

The configuration of *Any chart* widgets is in another document, here: [Any Chart Widgets](charts-any-configuration).

## 2 Common configuration

The common configuration for all charts is described here. For chart specific configuration see [Configuration by Chart Type](#configuration-by-chart-type),  below.

### 2.1 Chart properties

![Generic Chart properties dialog](attachments/pages/charts/line-chart-chart-properties.png)

#### 2.1.1 Series

Add series and configure their properties, each series represents a dataset. For example a line on a line chart.

* The *Pie Charts* and *Heat Maps* support only a single series containing a single set of data

  In this case, the **Data source** and **Data points** are shown as separate tabs in the widget.

  ![Pie chart dialog showing tabs for Data source and Data points](attachments/pages/charts/widget-data-source.png)

  The fields are the same as the ones described in the sections [Data source](#data-source) and [Data points](#data-points), below.

* Charts which support multiple series of data, like a line chart with multiple lines, support more than one series of data

  In this case, new series can be added by clicking the **Series > New** button in the **Chart properties** tab.

  {{% alert type="info" %}}From version 1.4 of charts you can create charts with a variable number of data series. For instructions on how to do this, see [How to Create a Dynamic Series Chart](/howto7/extensibility/charts-dynamic-series).{{% /alert %}}

1. Data source<a name="data-source"></a>

    The data for each each series can originate from a different data source. You can add additional data series in the **Chart properties** tab.
  
    ![Edit series Data source tab](attachments/pages/charts/series-item-data-source.png)

    * **Static/Dynamic**: Choose whether there is a fixed number of data series (lines, for example), or whether the number of data series is variable and will be decided by the app.

    * **Entity**: The entity from which the data values will be retrieved

    * **Data source**: the data source type for the series: *Database*, *Microflow* or *REST endpoint*

    * **REST URL**: Relative or full URL to REST endpoint. For more information on setting up a REST end point see [REST Charts](../howto7/extensibility/charts-basic-rest)

    * **XPath constraint**: The constraint on the data from the entity (used when the data source is Database)

    * **Microflow**: A microflow that returns a list object with data values

2. Data points<a name="data-points"></a>

    The attribute(s) within the data source used for the values to be plotted.
    
    ![Edit series Data points tab](attachments/pages/charts/series-item-data-points.png)

    * **X-axis data attribute**: For data source Database attributes over reference are supported with a maximum of one level deep. For data source Microflow, references are not supported

    * **Y-axis data attribute**: For data source Database attributes over reference are supported with a maximum of one level deep. For data source Microflow references are not supported

    * **X-axis sort attribute**: For data source Database attributes over reference are supported with a maximum of one level deep. For data source Microflow references are not supported

    * **Sort order**: The sort-order of the data provided by the "X-axis sort attribute"

    * **Aggregation type**: What to do if there are two y values in this series for one x value (for example if there are two data points in one series: (2,3), and (2,4)) – most of the options are self-explanatory, examples are:
      * Sum: plot the sum of the two values – (2,7) for the example above
      * Average: plot the mean of the two values (2,3.5)
      * None: plot just the first data point (2,3)

3. Appearance

    The appearance of the series. This is customized for each type of chart, see: [3 Configuration per chart type](#configuration-by-chart-type), below.

    ![Edit series Appearance tab](attachments/pages/charts/series-item-appearance.png)

4. Static Series

    Additional configuration for the appearance of the series if it is a static series. This is customized for each type of chart, see: [3 Configuration per chart type](#configuration-by-chart-type), below.    

    ![Data series Static series tab](attachments/pages/charts/series-item-static.png)

5. Dynamic Series

    Configuration of the series if it is a dynamic series.

    ![Data series Dynamic series tab](attachments/pages/charts/series-item-dynamic.png)

    * **Series entity**: the entity which defines a series – the list of objects of this entity type will be used to construct the series; one series for each object.
    
      Each entity is associated with the values which will be plotted, see [How to Create a Dynamic Series Chart](/howto7/extensibility/charts-dynamic-series) for more information.

    * **Series name attribute**: the attribute in the series entity which will be displayed as the series name if a legend is displayed

    * **Color attribute**: the attribute in the series entity which defines the HTML color used when displayed this series – *there may be more than one color attribute if the chart allows different values (for example an area chart has separate line and fill colors)

    * **Series sort attribute**: allows you to sort the series by an attribute of the series entity – *this is not supported for **non-persistent** entities, such as those used when defining a REST datasource*

    * **Series sort order**: *Ascending* or *Descending*

6. Events

    The events to be supported if the user interacts with the chart.
    
    ![Edit series Events tab](attachments/pages/charts/series-item-events.png)

    {{% alert type="info" %}}The context of the page, microflow, or nanoflow selected for an event or tooltip will be the plotted object from which the point on the chart is drawn. This means you can display or use the x and y values, _and_ any other values stored in that object.<br /><br />For example you could use the tooltip to display the precise y value of a point, plus information on when the data was collected{{% /alert %}}
    
    * **On click**: Select the way a click of a data point should be handled:
      * Do nothing
      * Show a page
      * Call a microflow
      * Call a nanoflow

        Configure the corresponding setting.

      * **On click page**: The page that will be opened on click. Required when the **On click > Show a page** option is selected

      * **Open page as**: Full page, Popup or Blocking popup

      * **On click microflow**: The microflow that will be executed on click

      * **On click nanoflow**: The nanoflow that will be executed on click

    * **Tooltip form**: The page to show when a user hovers over a chart plot point

7. Advanced <a name="advanced"></a>

    ![Edit series Advanced tab](attachments/pages/charts/series-item-advanced.png)

    * **Options**: The Plotly *series options* in JSON format; these options will only be used when the *widget* tab **Advanced > Mode** is set to *Advanced* or *Developer*: see [Advanced](#advanced-mode), below.

#### 2.1.2 Appearance

The **Appearance** settings are used to set the size of the chart on the page.

![Generic Chart Appearance tab](attachments/pages/charts/widget-appearance.png)

* **Width unit**: The type of unit which is used for the **Width** property - *Percentage* or *Pixels*

* **Width**: The width of the chart in pixels or percentage based on the **Width unit** setting

* **Height unit**: The type of unit which is used for the **Height** property

  * **Percentage of width**: sets the aspect ratio
  * **Pixels**: is an absolute height
  * **Percentage of parent**: sets the height in relation to a container in which the widget is placed
  
  {{% alert type="warning" %}}When using **Percentage of parent** the parent container must have an **absolute** height, else nothing is displayed.{{% /alert %}}

* **Height**: The height in pixels or percentage based on the setting of **Height unit**

#### 2.1.3 REST

Add parameters to a REST request (see [Data source](#data-source)). The contextId, and series name are provided by default.

![Generic Chart REST tab](attachments/pages/charts/widget-rest.png)

#### 2.1.4 Advanced {#advanced-mode}

The charts are based on the popular framework plotly.js which uses JSON to configure the charts. In the advanced and developer mode, you can specify additional JSON: unlocking the many features of plotly.js. You can also do this with a live preview.

See the following link for more information about plotly.js and the options: https://plot.ly/javascript/.

![Generic Chart Advanced Tab](attachments/pages/charts/widget-advanced.png)

* **Mode**: You can use these charts in three different modes:

  * **Basic**: quickly setup a chart with the various widget options
  * **Advanced**: specify additional JSON configuration
  * **Developer**: this will add a **Toggle Editor** button to the chart at runtime which toggles an editor to play with different advanced configuration options

    ![](attachments/pages/charts/toggle-editor.png)

* **Layout options**: The JSON containing the Plotly layout options
  * [Samples](charts-advanced-cheat-sheet#layout-all)
  * [Full reference](https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#layout)

* **Configuration options**: The JSON containing the Plotly configuration options

## 4 Chart Theming

Advanced JSON settings can also be added in a global context via the theme folder of your mendix project root directory.

To the theme folder, add a `.json` file named *com.mendix.charts*. The JSON should be in the following format:

``` json
{
  "layout": {
    // Add shared layout options here (for all charts)
  },
  "configuration": {
    // Add shared configuration options here (for all charts)
  },
  "charts": {
    "LineChart": {
      "layout": {
        // Add line chart only layout options here
      },
      "data": {
        // Add line chart only data options here
      },
      "configuration": {
          // Add line chart only configuration options here
      }
    },
    "AreaChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "BubbleChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "TimeSeries": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "ColumnChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "BarChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "PieChart": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    },
    "HeatMap": {
      // Same arrangement as the line chart
    }
  }
}
```

{{% alert type="info" %}}

Please use with caution, as the configuration set up here shall be applied to every instance of the charts in your application.  
Only the advanced configurations set up in the widget itself have a higher precedence.
