## Introduction

Mobile applications have unique properties that must be taken into consideration when designing the user interface of a mobile application:

* Mobile apps are used in changing environments, for example while commuting between various locations
* The primary way to interact with mobile apps is to directly touch a small screen
* Mobile users frequently switch between multiple apps and use each for short amounts of time
