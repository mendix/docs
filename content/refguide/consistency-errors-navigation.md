## 1 Introduction 

In this document, we explain how to solve the most common consistency errors that can occur when configuring navigation in Studio Pro. An example of a consistency error is when you set a page that has a data view as a menu item. 

{{% alert type="info" %}}

This document does not describe *all* the errors, as there are a lot of errors that can occur, some of which are simple and do not need extra explanation, others are rare and/or heavily dependent on a use-case. 

{{% /alert %}}

Some errors have error codes and if these errors are described in documentation, Studio Pro has a clickable link to the corresponding document. Others do not have an error code, in this case, you can manually search whether a particular error is described in documentation (you can search by a message you see in the **Errors** pane).

## 2 Navigation Consistency Errors 

The most common errors you can come across when configuring a navigation item are described in the table below:

| Error Code | Message in the Errors Pane                                   | Cause of the Error                                           | Way to Fix                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CE0568     | The selected page {Name of the page} expects an object of type {type of object}, which is not available here. | You have set a page that expects an object to be passed to it (a page with a data view and the **Context** data source) as a menu item. | Pass an object to the page by changing the **On click** property  of the menu item from **Show a page** to **Create object**. For more information, see the [Error Fix Example for CE0568](#page-expects-an-object) section. |
| CE0529     | The selected {Name of the page} expects an object of type {type of object} and cannot be used as a home page. Change the page or use a microflow to provide the page with an object. | You have set a page that expects an object to be passed to it (for example, a page with a data view) as a home page. But the home page has no object that is passed to it, because it is the starting point of a flow. | You can use a microflow as the home page that will open the preferred page and pass a specific object to the home page. For more information, see the [Error Fix Example for CE0529](#home-page-expects-an-object). |
| CE0548     | Items with subitems cannot have an action themselves.        | You have assigned an [on-click event](on-click-event) to a menu item that has a sub-item, when menu items with have sub-items cannot have on-click events assigned to them. | You need to either set the on-click event of the menu item to *Nothing*, or delete/move the sub-item. |

### 2.1 Error Fix Example for CE0568 {#page-expects-an-object}

When you set a page with a data view as a menu item, you get a consistency error, because the page expects an object to be passed to it. 

For example, you have created a menu item called **Program** for a **Responsive** [profile](navigation#profiles). This menu item opens the **Program** page. However, the **Program** page has a data view on it and expects a *ProgramItem* object to be passed to it, so that it can show the program details of a specific *ProgramItem* on the page. As a result, you get a consistency error, as no object is passed to this page from the navigation.

To fix the error, you can create an object and pass it to the page. Do the following:

1. Open the navigation for the responsive profile.

2.  Open properties of the **Program** menu item, and do the following: <br/>

    a. Change the **On click** property from **Show a page** to **Create object**. <br/>

    b. Set **ProgramItem** as **Entity (path)**. <br/>

    c. Set **Program** as **On click page**. <br/>

Now when an end-user clicks the menu item, a new *ProgramItem* object will be created and passed to the page.

### 2.2. Error Fix Example for CE0529 {#home-page-expects-an-object}

If you set a page that expects an object to be passed to it as a home page for a [navigation profile](navigation#properties), you will get a consistency error.

For example, you have added a data view that expects an object of type *Customer* to the home page of the responsive profile, and you get a consistency error. 

![Home Page Error](attachments/consistency-errors-navigation/home-page-error.png)

You can fix this error by creating a microflow that will that will create a new *Customer* object and pass it to the page. Do the following:

1. Open the responsive navigation profile.

2.  In **Default home page field** click **Select**.

    ![Default Home Page Setting](attachments/consistency-errors-navigation/default-home-page-field.png)

3. In the **Select Navigation Target** dialog box, click **New**, then select **Create Microflow**.

4. Name the microflow *ACT_Open_HomePage*.

5. Open the created microflow, add a **Create object** activity to it 

6.  For the **Create object** activity, set **Entity** to **Customer**. 

    ![Create Object Properties](attachments/consistency-errors-navigation/create-object-properties.png)

7. Add Show Page activity to the microflow and do the following in the **Show Page** pop-up dialog:<br/>

    a. Set **Object to pass** to **NewCustomer**.<br/>

    b. Set **Page** to **Home**.

Now the new object of type *Customer* will be created and passed to the home page.
