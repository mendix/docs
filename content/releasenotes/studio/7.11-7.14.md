## 2018

### June 29th, 2018

#### New Features

* We added **Create variable** and **Change variable** activities to the microflow editor, so as to enhance the number of cases you can configure in Mendix Studio. Use **Create variable** to create a variable that can store, change, and reuse a specified value. Use **Change variable** to change the value of an existing variable in the current microflow. 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where an entity in the domain model editor jumped to the right if you dragged it outside your current viewport. 

### June 22nd, 2018

#### Improvements

* In the page editor, we improved the process of adding attributes in text widgets so that you can build applications even faster. Now, when selecting an attribute to use in the text, you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> as a keyboard shortcut.

#### Fixes

* In the page editor, we fixed the bug where PNG images could not be uploaded in Safari.

### June 15th, 2018

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where the user got stuck on the loading spinner if the connection to Mendix Studio failed. Now, when the connection is restored, the page will reload.
* We fixed an issue where the error pop-up window was not always on top of other pop-up windows.
* We fixed an issue where custom widgets on the page could not be dragged once placed.
* We fixed an issue where the user could drag items to the **Navigation Document** while in read-only mode.

### June 11th, 2018

#### New Features

* Elective application upgrade: with the latest release of Studio, applications created with version 7.11 and above will not auto-upgrade when they are opened in Studio. Instead, users will receive a prompt to upgrade if it is available, but they do not have to select it. This is great for users on the business side and in IT who want to leverage both Studio and Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro to collaborate on the same application.

#### Improvements

* To improve the user experience, we added a pop-up window when the user goes offline with information that the internet connection has been lost. Once the connection is restored, the pop-up window will disappear automatically.
* The selection of items in the lists opened from the left sidebar menu (for example, pages, domain models, microflows) has been improved, including use of the up arrow and down arrow keys.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where the user ended up in read-only mode after refreshing.
* We fixed an issue where single-key shortcuts were triggered by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + {shortcut} or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + {shortcut} (for example, the **Checks** panel was opened when pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of pressing <kbd>C</kbd>).

### June 4th, 2018

#### New Features

* We added keyboard shortcuts to make the process of building applications even faster. The new hotkeys are for opening editors (such as the page editor, microflow editor, and domain model editor) as well as for publishing and viewing the app. To learn which hotkeys are available, click the information icon in the top-right corner of Studio, then select the **Keyboard Shortcuts** option.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue that occurred when the user clicked **Yes** and wanted to skip the guided product introduction tour, but the tour could only be skipped by clicking **Cancel**. To skip the guided product tour, you now need to click **Yes**.
* We fixed an issue where you could not use an attribute as a source for an **Open Link** action in a list view.
* We fixed an issue where Adobe PhoneGap Build service custom widgets were always considered out of date when the widgets were present in pages.

### May 25th, 2018

#### Improvements

* We improved the process of creating and editing attributes of the enumeration type in domain models. To make the process faster and more user-friendly, we redesigned the **Create new enumeration** wizard in the domain model editor.
* When you are editing a microflow and rearranging the existing activities in it, a preview of an activity now shows you where you can place that activity. This hint makes the process of editing microflows easier.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where a pop-up window did not appear in the **Buzz** tab when typing an `@` symbol to mention team members. 

### May 18th, 2018

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where the the guided product introduction tour sometimes crashed when opening the **Create new page** wizard on slow connections.

### May 11th, 2018

#### New Features

* We added a quick search to make the process of searching different elements in your application faster. Click the magnifying glass icon in the left menu bar to search through microflows, entities, and pages. Simply start typing the name of the item you are looking for and the search feature will return any matches it finds, using exact matches as well as fuzzy matches based on the characters entered.

#### Improvements

* When dragging new elements to a microflow, a preview of the element shows you where you can place this element. This hint makes the process of creating microflows easier.
* We improved the **Pages** icon and color in the left menu bar for a better modeling experience.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue that caused Studio to crash when a custom widget contained a nanoflow property.

### May 1st, 2018

#### New Features

This release contains collaborative modeling features that will benefit collaboration within extended development teams. Such teams consist of, for example, business developers, professional developers, product owners, key users, UX designers, and other stakeholders.

* Using the new **Buzz** tab, you can now leave comments on pages, domain models, microflows, and navigation layouts. You can also respond to comments made by other team members.
* Mentioning a team member at any point in time will trigger an email notification to that user containing your comment and a link to the document you commented on in Studio.
* All conversations are visible on the **Buzz** section of the Developer Portal. The conversation will contain a link to access the page, domain model, microflow, or navigation layout directly in Studio.
* You can now create feedback items directly from your app's **Buzz** for any topics that should be part of the next Sprint’s grooming by selecting **Create Feedback Item** from the top menu inside a Buzz conversation. This generates a feedback item in the Developer Portal tied directly to the app component in question, which product owners can then follow up on.
* When multiple users open the app in Studio, one user is in control while others can still view the entire app model and contribute to any running Buzz conversations. This means they are fully part of the development process.
* As a view-only user, you can see the latest changes performed by others by clicking **Refresh**, or you take control yourself with one click by selecting **Take Over**.

In summary, by connecting communication directly to the application model, Mendix Studio paves the way for development teams to remain engaged and in the loop throughout the development lifecycle. This allows each team member to contribute to a successful result.
For more information about these features, please see the [Mendix 7.14 release blog post](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mendix-7-14-the-power-of-teamwork/).

#### Improvements

* We added support for [Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.14.1](../studio-pro/7.14). The minimum supported version remains Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.11.0.

### April 25th, 2018

#### Improvements

* You can now move activities within a microflow, whereas previously an activity was unmovable once positioned. This makes it easier and faster to manage microflows. The improvement includes all microflow activities, exclusive and inheritance splits, and merges and loops if they have only one incoming or one outgoing connection. 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where a step was skipped during the guided product introduction tour.

### April 18th, 2018

#### Improvements

* We added inline editing functionality to the domain model editor and the navigation editor. This makes it very easy and intuitive to change the captions of entities, attributes, and navigation menu items. Simply double-click the caption and start typing straight away.
* Any user can now start a short guided product introduction tour at any moment, in any app. This helps you find your way easily. To start the tour, select the **Take a Product Tour** option from the information menu at the top-right of Studio.
* You can now change the caption of microflow activities in the microflow editor. This allows you to build a microflow just the way you want it to be, with captions you recognize easily.
* The **Checks** panel can now be resized by dragging it. This is the panel in which consistency errors are shown. The resizable panel helps you to keep an overview when solving consistency errors.
* In the microflow editor, the element that causes a consistency error is now highlighted when you click the consistency error record. This helps you to solve consistency errors fast.

#### Fixes

* The page editor no longer crashes when encountering a list view with a nanoflow data source (for example, if this was incorporated using Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro).
* We fixed an issue where the custom widget **Text Box Search** made Studio crash if no entity was provided.

### March 27th, 2018 

#### Improvements

* In the page editor, the following widgets are now rendered in their full glory (meaning, when you add them to your model using Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro):
  * Data grids
  * Template grids
  * Reference set selectors
  * Input reference set selectors
  * Table widgets
  * Header widgets from your layouts
  * Report widgets
  * Snippets
  * Widgets specific to the login page
* At this stage *all* the Mendix widgets supported by Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro are now rendered in Studio. This will further streamline collaboration between users of Mendix Studio and Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro. It also enables you to use Studio live in meetings (for example, in frequent iterations during the app development cycle).
* Input widgets set to read-only will now render as such in Studio's page editor. For example, if you configure a text box widget to be rendered as a control or as a text widget, it will now render the same way in Studio as for an end-user, regardless of editability.
* In the microflow editor, you are now able to connect annotations with microflow activities. In this way, the valuable information often contained in annotations will always be in context, even when the activity is moved during the construction of the microflow. This will benefit users in understanding and maintaining microflows.
* We added support for the release of Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro version 7.13.1. The minimum supported version remains Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.11.0.

#### Fixes

* We fixed the "Something went wrong" messages that appeared when creating new enumeration items and new microflows.
* Studio will now start even if the App Store cannot be reached.

### March 5th, 2018 

#### Improvements

* We've added tooltips to various controls to make things easier for new users to comprehend.
* The header of the page editor toolbox is "sticky" now, so it does not scroll along with the **Toolbox** contents. This makes it easier for users to browse widgets and/or building blocks. 
* The order of the editors in the left sidebar menu has been improved to better match user expectations and improve overall modeling experience.
* In both the domain model editor and microflow editor, after dragging an item from the toolbox, the side panel will not toggle to the **Properties** pane. Instead it will keep displaying the **Toolbox**. This improves modeling speed, as we have witnessed in various user tests.
* An animation is now shown as custom widgets are updated on the **App Settings** page to inform the user that the widget is being updated in the background.
* Based on user feedback, we improved the guided product introduction tour, available when you select **Start Your First App** from the **Introduction Tour** category in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/) when you create a new app.
* We improved the drawing and auto-resizing of microflows when a user removes one or more activities from a microflow.
* In the microflow editor, the **Refresh In Client** property for **Create object** and **Change object** activities now has the default value **True**. This prevents the consequences of users accidentally not setting this property, as witnessed in many user tests.
* Java actions and connectors may be part of your microflows (for example, when added to your model using Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro). If so, they are now fully rendered in Studio's microflow editor. Also, the return type of a Java action is now available for use in microflows.
* We added support for [Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.12.0](../studio-pro/7.12). The minimum supported version remains Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.11.0.
* A maintenance page is now shown when Studio is unavailable due to maintenance activities by Mendix. 
  
#### Fixes

* Only the filtering of non-form page templates is now allowed while creating edit pages.
* Studio now handles conversion and custom widget requests better. 
  
### February 7th, 2018 

#### Improvements

* In all dialog boxes, you can now use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> shortcut to confirm your choices and close the dialog box. For simple dialog boxes containing only one field, pressing only <kbd>Enter</kbd> works to confirm and close the dialog box.
* In the domain model editor, it is now possible to swap the direction of an association by using the **Swap Direction** button or icon. If you are unsure which direction an association between two entities should have, you can now create it either way. Then, if the **Multiplicity** property does not contain the option you need, you can switch the association direction to configure it correctly. This will save you time when setting up your domain model.
* We introduced a feature to the domain model editor that arranges the position of entities automatically. When your view is becoming cluttered with entity objects and association lines, click the **Auto arrange entities** icon in the upper-left corner of the editor. We’ll then use an algorithm to determine the best possible placement of items on your screen. Still not happy with the result? Click the icon again to see if we can come up with something better.
* In both the microflow editor and domain model editor, the canvas will now follow the cursor if it is moved outside the visible area. This makes it easy to work with more extensive microflows and domain models.

#### Fixes

* In the page editor, the **Create** button on the **Create New Attribute** dialog box now functions properly, even when used after clicking **Add parameter** (which is used, for example, for the **Caption** property of a widget).

### January 29th, 2018 

#### Improvements

* In the page editor, you can now configure the page size of list views by changing the value of the **Page Size** property. The WYSIWYG editor will instantly render the number of rows you entered.
* When you create a page from an entity context that contains an Atlas UI data view, you will now see a new check box in the **Create new page** wizard: **Pre-fill page contents based on the `<name>` entity**. When you check this box, page content will pre-fill automatically. This speeds up initial app development by automagically adding and wiring the appropriate widgets for the entity specified.
* When using exclusive splits in the microflow editor, we now auto-configure the last split condition of an exclusive split. This will save you time and keep you from unintentionally omitting that condition.
* You can now easily jump to the microflow that serves as the data source for your data widget by clicking the arrow icon that is located right next to the **Data Source** property.
* We added support for [Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.11.0](../studio-pro/7.11). The minimum (and only) supported version is now Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.11.0.

## 2017

### December 18th, 2017 

#### Improvements

* You can now use the radio buttons widget in the page editor.
* For an **Exclusive Split**, you can now configure split cases using the **Add case** button in the **Properties** pane of the microflow editor.
* We added a progress bar to the steps in the guided product introduction tour that is available when you select **Start Your First App** when creating an app in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/).
* We added support for the forthcoming release of Mendix 7.10.

* You are now able to configure **Close page** and **Show home page** activities in the microflow editor.
* Your SCSS is no longer compiled to CSS when opening Studio, so you won't have styling changes when you sync with Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro without having changed any styling in Studio.

### November 20th, 2017

#### Improvements

* You are now able to configure splits with enumerations in the microflow editor. This adds a host of opportunities for adding logic to your app!

* You are now able to combine multiple flows using a **Merge** in the microflow editor
* You are now able to delete sequence flows and annotation flows in the microflow editor.
* We improved texts of the **Publish** dialog box for initial deployments.
* You can now configure an **Exclusive Split** activity and drag in a new **End Event** from the **Toolbox** in the microflow editor to create additional split cases.

### November 8th, 2017

#### Improvements

* You can now configure a **Show Message** activity in the microflow editor.
* Studio now shows the default user avatar in the main menu bar if the profile service is down and the actual user profile cannot be retrieved.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue that redirected the user to the `project/null` URL while syncing with Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro or during model conversion.

### November 2nd, 2017

#### Improvements

* We improved the text of the guided product introduction tour.

#### Fixes

* We fixed the **Locked by** pop-up window so that the username of the person who locked the app is shown.

### October 26th, 2017

#### Improvements

* We added support for [Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.8.0](../studio-pro/7.8).

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where apps could not be opened in Studio if they weren't created from an Atlas UI template through the Developer Portal app creation flow.
* We fixed the browser detection for browsers that do not support ES2015 syntax or that do not provide certain ES5 APIs.

### October 19th, 2017

#### Improvements

* We introduced guidance for first-time users. A guided product introduction tour is now shown when you select **Start Your First App** from the **Introduction Tour** category when creating an app in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/).
* You can now clear the selected icon for buttons and dynamic image widgets in the page editor.
* You can now configure the data source of the **Dynamic Image** viewer. Also, the **On Click Action** of both the **Dynamic image** and static **Image** viewers can be configured in the page editor.
* You can now upload new images for image widgets in the page editor.
* False positive changes in *entry-prefix.css* no longer occur when syncing with Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro.

### October 3rd, 2017

#### Improvements

* You are now able to reconnect microflow objects in the microflow editor.
* You are now able to delete all microflow objects (along with deleting them using the keyboard) in the microflow editor.
* Along with all of its button cousins, we now support the creation and configuration of link buttons. You can find the new **Open Link** button in your **Toolbox**. An old favorite from Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro, link buttons allow you to, for example, redirect the browser to a new page, an email form, or the call/messaging apps on your phone.
* We added support for [Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.7.1](../studio-pro/7.7)

#### Fixes

* We fixed the problem that prevented configuring an add-on widget when one of its properties used a relative path in its `entityProperty` configuration.

### September 5th, 2017

#### Improvements

* Entity access will no longer be out of date when adding or removing attributes, associations, and entities, so you won't need to go to Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro anymore to fix this problem. Deployment in Studio will succeed after the aforementioned actions.
* We improved the publish-application flow by updating some messages in the **Publish** dialog box.
* Menu bars and navigation trees configured with a custom menu document are now displayed.
* We implemented a page where you can upgrade the model to the newest version. You will see this page every time the minimum supported version for Studio is updated so that you can keep using Studio.
* You can now add and configure an **Exclusive Split** for Boolean conditions (based on variable or attribute values) in the microflow editor.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in the microflow editor elements that was causing synchronization with Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro to fail.

### August 28th, 2017

#### Improvements

* You can now edit text widgets inline in the page editor. Double-click a text to start editing it, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to add another line.
* We added support for [Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro 7.6.0](../studio-pro/7.6).

#### Fixes

* Pressing <kbd>Delete</kbd> no longer tries to remove the currently selected element when the focus is on an input box or search field.

### August 15th, 2017

#### Improvements

* You can now change the (default) image for an image widget as well as configure the width and height of image widgets in the page editor.
* We implemented basic keyboard support for the modal dialog boxes. You can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to jump to the next input field or button inside a modal dialog box. You can also use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the dialog box.

#### Fixes

* We added keyboard support for undo, redo, and delete operations.
* You can now add annotations to your microflows in the microflow editor.
* We fixed the initial layout selection in the **Create new page** wizard.
* We added an information message to the **Checks** panel to clarify for the user that the list with consistency errors will be refreshed only after the next publishing of the app.

### July 25th, 2017

#### Improvements

* You can now use enumerations to set the initial values of members in the microflow editor.
* When an input widget is not yet wrapped in a data view or list view, you can now easily wrap it with a new data view in the page editor.
* We now also load styling for new custom widgets when inserting a building block that contains them in the page editor.
* It is now possible to remove custom widget packages from a project. All existing widget instances will be removed from all the pages automatically (where applicable).

#### Fixes

* We fixed Desktop Modeler/Studio Pro links not opening the correct projects.

### July 13th, 2017

#### Fixes

* The initial deployment of an app is no longer represented as if the user started it in the deploy pop-up window.
* We fixed the bug that removed the current value of the text widget after adding a parameter in the page editor **Toolbox**.
