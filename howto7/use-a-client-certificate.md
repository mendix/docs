## 1 Introduction

Some web services require you to authenticate using a client certificate. This how-to describes how to configure your app to do this.

Let's assume that you already have an app that calls a web service. For details on how to configure this, have a look at [How to Consume a Simple Web Service](consume-a-simple-web-service).

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Configure to run locally
* Configure in the Mendix Cloud

## 2 Prerequisites

* A PKCS12 certificate file that contains a private key â€” these files typically have the _.pfx_ or _.p12_ file extension
* The password to open that file

## 3 Running Locally

To configure the custom settings that are only used when you run your app locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your app in the Modele and go to **Project** > **Settings**.
2. Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Configuration** dialog box, and select the **Custom** tab.
3. Add these three custom settings:

    Name | Value | Notes
    --- | --- | ---
    ClientCertificates | The full paths to the certificate files. | Separate with commas if you have more than one file. Backslashes in the paths should not be doubled.
    ClientCertificatePasswords | The password for each certificate file.  | In the same order as the **ClientCertificates**.
    WebServiceClientCertificates | The description of which files to use for which service, in the format of `"ModuleName.WebserviceName": "full path"`. | If you have more than one web service to configure, you can separate them with commas. The whole setting value needs to be enclosed in curly brackets ["{ }"]. Backslashes in the paths must be doubled. In addition, the paths you specify here should all appear in **ClientCertificates**.

This is an example:

```
{ "Module.WebService1": "D:\\App\\Mx1.pfx", "Module.WebService2": "D:\\App\\Mx2.pfx" }
```

A complete configuration can look like this:

## 4 Running in the Cloud

You will only be able to follow the steps below if you have the correct access rights for the client certificates.

To configure client certificates in the Mendix Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Mendix Cloud Portal](https://cloud.home.mendix.com/) and click **Details** next to your app.
2. Each environment has its own configuration. Click **Details** next one of the environments.
3. Click **Network** and scroll down to **Certificates for outgoing connections**.
4. Click **Add client certificate**. Upload the certificate files.
5. After the files have been uploaded, they appear in the list. Double-click an item in the list.
6. In the **Pin Client Certificate to Web Services** section of the **Details** screen, add the names of the web services for which you want to use this certificate.
7. Enter these names in the **ModuleName.WebServiceName** form.
8. Close the **Details** screen.
9. Click **Stop application** and then **Start application**.
