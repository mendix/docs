This activity can only be used in **Microflows**.
{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

The **Apply jump-to option** activity allows the workflow to jump to a selected activity. This activity should be used after the [Generate jump-to options](/refguide/generate-jump-to-options/) activity that generates the list of possible workflow activities the workflow can jump to. This is useful when, for example, the workflow is in incompatible state and the Workflow Administrator or any other user should be able to select a specific activity where the workflow can continue.

For more information on configuring the jumping to other activities, see [Jumping to Different Activities in a Workflow](/refguide/jump-to/).

This functionality is different from the [Jump activity](/refguide/jump-activity/) in workflows, which you can add from the **Toolbox** when you configure the workflow.
