## Introduction

Local accounts, meaning accounts created by a tenant administrator, can access and change their profile information via the **Edit Profile** page. 

For more details on tenant administration, see [Administration](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/rg-two-administration/).

## Performing Basic Functions

### Opening the Edit Profile Page

To open the **Edit Profile** page, do the following:

1. Click your profile photo 

2. Click **Show Profile**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/rg-ats/v2/rg-two-profile/profile.png" alt="Edit profile page" class="no-border" >}}

### Changing the Full Name 

To change your **Full name** from the **Edit Profile** page, type a new one in a text box. The change is automatically saved. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Full name is displayed in various places in the app, for example, in the test run history. This is not the user name which is used to log in.

{{% /alert %}} 

### Changing Password

To change your password from the **Edit Profile** page, do the following:

1. Click **Change password**.

2. Enter your new password.

3. Click **Change**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
To change your password, you need to log in first. If you have problems with logging in, contact your tenant administrator. For more details on tenant administration, see [Administration](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/rg-two-administration/).
