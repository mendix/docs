## 1 Introduction 

The **Events** section is a section in the **Properties** tab that is common for different widgets in Mendix Studio, for example, for a static image, buttons, list view, and data view. 

In the **Events** section, you can set the **On Click Action** for widgets and specify what action will be performed when users click the widget. For example, you can specify that when a user clicks a profile image, the page with the user's personal account will open.

## 2 On Click Action {#on-click-action}  

You can find the description of possible on click actions below:

* **Nothing** – no action is taken when the user clicks a widget
* **Page** –  the specified page is opened
  * **Create Object** – creates a new object and passed it to the selected page (disabled by default). For more information, see section [2.1 Create Object Option](#create-object-option)
* **Microflow** – the selected microflow is executed 
* **More** – contains the following type of actions:
  * **Save Changes** – saves (commits) all changes made on the page
  * **Cancel Changes** – rolls back all changes made on the page 
  * **Close Page** – closes the pop-up window (for pop-up pages) or navigates to the previously visited page  
  * **Sign Out** – the current user is signed out of the app 
  * **Open Link** – triggers an action based on the link type (for more information, see section [2.2 Open Link Action](#open-link-action)
  * **Delete Object** – deletes an object (for more information, see section [2.3 Delete Object Action](#delete-object-action))

{{% alert color="info" %}}

The list of available on click actions may differ depending on the widget. For example, **Delete Object** on-click action is unavailable for the list view. 

{{% /alert %}}

### 2.1 Create Object Option {#create-object-option}

When you set the **On Click Action** to **Open Page**, you can enable the **Create Object** option. You need to pass an object if the selected page expects a context. 

For example, you want to create a new customer by clicking the **New** button. This button will open a page where you can fill in a new customer's details and save them. However, the *Customer Details* page needs to get data first, in other words, it expects the object *Customer* to be passed to it. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio8/checks/consistency-errors/consistency-errors-navigation/data-view-customer.png" alt="Data View Expects the Customer Object"   width="350"  >}}

Thus, when setting the on-click action of the **New** button to **Page**, you need to enable the **Create Object** option and select the **Customer** entity.

If you enable **Create Object** option, you need to set the following:

* **Page** – specifies which page with the new created object should be shown. The page should contain a data view that expects this object.
* **Entity** – specifies the object of which entity will be created and passed to the selected page as a context.    

### 2.2 Open Link Action {#open-link-action}

When you set the **On Click Action** to **Open Link**, several properties are available.

See the description in the table below:

| Action Property | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Link Type       | Possible values for **Link Type** are the following: <ul><li>**Web** – navigates to a website</li><li>**Email** – composes an email</li><li>**Phone Call** – starts a phone call</li><li>**Text Message** – sends a text message</li></ul>{{%alert type="info" %}}When you configure **Email**, **Phone Call** or **Message** options, the corresponding default app will be opened on the device when the action is triggered, for example, the default email client will be opened to compose a message.<br />{{%/alert %}} |
| Source          | Possible values for **Source** are the following: <ul><li>**Use literal value** – you can fill a value out (Specify **Url** for **Web**, **Recipient** for **Email**, and **Phone Number** for **Phone Cal**l and **Message**) </li><li>**Use attribute** – if you select **Database**>**Entity** as a data source for the list view,  you can choose the attribute of a string type that belongs to the entity or create a new one (when the **Use attribute** option is configured, you do not need to fill out any information manually, it will be updated dynamically)</li></ul> |

### 2.3 Delete Object Action {#delete-object-action}

Behavior of the **Delete Object** action depends on a data container it is placed in: a [list view](/studio8/page-editor-data-view-list-view/#list-view-properties) or a [data view](/studio8/page-editor-data-view-list-view/#data-view-properties). 

#### 2.3.1 Delete Object Action in a List View

If you place the **Delete Object** in a list view, the corresponding list view item will be deleted, when a user clicks a button.

For example, you have a page with a list view showing customer names. A **Delete** button is placed inside the list next to each name. Thus, if you click **Delete** in a line that says "Peter", this customer and all customer's details will be deleted.

#### 2.3.2 Delete Object Action in a Data View

When placed on a data view, **Delete Object** will delete the connected object. For example, you opened a page with customer's details. The details are placed in a data view. You have **Save** and **Delete** buttons at the bottom of the page. When you press **Delete**, the customer "John" and customer's details will be deleted and the page will be closed.
