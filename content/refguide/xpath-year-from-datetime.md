The `year-from-dateTime()` function extracts the amount of years from a DateTime attribute so it can be used to compare to a value.

```java
//Logging.Log[year-from-dateTime(DateAttribute) = 2011]
```

This query returns all Logs where the amount of years in DateAttribute is 2011, for example 2011-12-30.
