## Introduction

While you can create a simple Mendix app using widgets on pages, you can unleash the power of Mendix by adding application logic to your app.

Application logic in Mendix can be implemented via microflows, running on the runtime server, and nanoflows, which run in the Mendix client.

Explore the documentation for details on microflow and nanoflow definitions, properties, and usages.
