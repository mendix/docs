## Introduction

The search bar contains search fields that allow the end-user to quickly find the information they need.

## Search Fields

There are three different types of search fields that can be used for different kinds of information.

To add a search field to the search bar, right-click within the search bar in your data grid and choose **Add search field >**.

You cannot change the type of a search field, you will need to delete it and then add a new one of a different type.
