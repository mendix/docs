These release notes cover changes to the Mendix Profile, Mendix Forum, and other [Mendix community tools](/community-tools/).

## 2023

### October 26, 2023

#### Improvements

* In Academy, we now have a new user-friendly experience for taking the [Mendix Rapid Developer Exam](https://academy.mendix.com/link/rapiddeveloper).

### June 29, 2023

#### New Features

* We introduced a Mendix Profile recovery email address option that allows you to prove ownership of a profile during the profile merge process. You can provide a non-business email address for this.

#### Improvements

* We changed the process for merging Mendix Profiles so that the profiles are truly merged and your user accounts stay connected to the resulting Mendix Profile. Previously, profile data was moved from one account to another.

### March 23, 2023

#### Improvements

* You can now create and manage personal access tokens (PATs) in **User Settings** > **Developer Settings**. This location replaces the Warden tool that was previously used. For more information, see the [Personal Access Tokens](/community-tools/mendix-profile/#pat) section in *Mendix Profile*.

### March 9, 2023

#### Improvements

* We simplified the way your [Notification](/community-tools/mendix-profile/#notifications) settings are stored.

### February 23, 2023

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where the country of residence you selected during sign-up was not properly stored in your [Mendix Profile](/community-tools/mendix-profile/#profile).

### February 13, 2023 {#feb-13-23}

#### Improvements

* We moved the notification settings you set for your app management to **Account Settings** > [Notifications](/community-tools/mendix-profile/#notifications) (which you can access via the menu beneath your avatar in the top bar). This page includes a list of the apps you are watching.
* In addition, personal **API Keys** are available via **Account Settings** > [Developer Settings](/community-tools/mendix-profile/#dev-settings).

## 2022

### August 22, 2022

#### New Features

* We have changed the password reset flow:
    * You can no longer update your password from your Mendix Profile.
    * All password resets and changes are now done via the [New Password Request page](https://login.mendix.com/mxid3/request-password-reset), which you can reach using the **Forgot password?** link on the login screen. This will send a password reset link to your registered email address.

### August 9, 2022

#### New Features

* We released [Notifications](/developerportal/global-navigation/#notifications) for beta usage, which allows you to receive updates from Academy, Data Hub, Developer Portal, Epics, and Forum. Additionally, you can manage what kind of updates you will receive in the [Notification Settings](https://user-settings.mendix.com/link/notifications) page.

### July 14, 2022

#### Improvements

* We removed the profile buzz page.

### June 16, 2022

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where users with an invalid Twitter URL in the **Social** section of their Mendix Profile Settings could not change their password.

### April 7, 2022

#### Improvements

* We introduced a new layout of the [Mendix Forum](/community-tools/mendix-forum/) that features the following changes:
    * The main navigation has been moved to a navigation pane on the left of the screen
    * There is a dedicated for page for your bookmarks
    * Breadcrumb navigation
    * Dedicated pages for Forum content you have interacted with (asked, answered, and commented for questions, and submitted and commented for ideas)

### February 10, 2022

#### New Features

* We changed the button from favorite to bookmark in the [Mendix Forum](/community-tools/mendix-forum/). You can now more easily bookmark posts for future reference.

## 2021

### December 23, 2021

#### Improvements

* We recently changed the password length requirement from 8 to 12 characters. We noticed this caused some confusion, because not all pages where the password can be reset or changed listed the password requirements. We made sure that all pages now list those requirements.

### December 15, 2021

#### Improvements

* We changed the minimum length of passwords from 8 to 12 characters.

### September 13, 2021
