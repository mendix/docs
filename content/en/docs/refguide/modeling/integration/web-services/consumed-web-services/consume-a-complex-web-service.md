## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how to consume a (third-party) web service with which you can integrate your Mendix application and re-use functionality and data from other applications. Web services are the preferred way of integrating a Mendix application with external systems. They can be used to retrieve data, send updates, and perform operations. In Mendix, calling a web service is done in a microflow using the call web service action.

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Directly import a web service document into your app
* Configure a web service call

## 2 Importing a Web Service

You can import a web service document into your app. For further information, see [Consumed Web Services](/refguide/consumed-web-services/) in the *Studio Pro Guide*.

To import a web service directly, follow these steps:

1. Right-click a module and select **Add Other** > **Consumed web service**.
2. Specify a name for the new consumed web service and click **OK**.
3. In the **Consumed Web Service** box, specify the **WSDL Source** to be used for this consumed web service. Click **Edit**, and in the **WSDL Source** dialog box, specify a **URL** or load a **File** from your computer.

4. Click **Import** to fetch the services and operations in the WSDL. If prompted, in the **WSDL Source** dialog box, select the ports you want to use and click **OK**.

5. In the **Consumed Web Services** screen, review the **Services** and **Operations** available to the imported web service. If you click on any of the **Operations**, information about the operation will be displayed in the right pane. You can select individual web service operations from the list otherwise the whole service and operation will be imported:

## 3 Configuring the Web Service Call

To configure the web service call, follow these steps:

1. If you did not use the web service wizard or did not use the option in the wizard to automatically create a microflow, you have to create a microflow that will call the imported web service:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/consume-a-complex-web-service/import-microflow.png" >}}

    {{% alert color="info" %}}Make sure the microflow either creates the variables required as arguments for the web service call or has them passed to it.{{% /alert %}}

2. If you are creating your own microflow, add the call web service activity to the microflow. For details on how to add activities to a microflow, see [Activities](/refguide/activities/) in the *Studio Pro Guide*.
3. Double-click the activity to open the **Call Web Service** properties editor and in the **Operation** section, click **Select** for **Operation**.
4. In the **Select Web Service Operation** dialog box, you can select the operation for this web service call:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/consume-a-complex-web-service/select-web-service-op.png" alt="select web service op" >}}

5. In the **SOAP Request Body** tab of the **Call Web Service** properties editor, you can configure the SOAP body. This contains the parameters needed to execute the web service request. The **Simple**, **Export Mapping**, and **Custom** options enable you to select the type of SOAP body to use. Click **Edit value** and use one of the following to change the domain-to-XML mapping or the variables from the microflow used as input arguments:
    * **Simple expressions for each request parameter** — if the imported web service requires only primitive arguments:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/consume-a-complex-web-service/simple-expression-param.png" >}}

    * **Export mappings for each request parameter** or **Export mapping for the entire request**  — if the domain model entities need to be mapped to XML elements
    * **Custom request template** — for the definition of a custom XML body with parameters:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/consume-a-complex-web-service/custom-request-temp.png" alt="custom-request-temp" >}}

6. In the **HTTP Headers** tab, if the Mendix Runtime should use HTTP authentication before calling the web service, check **Use HTTP authentication** and enter the **User name** and **Password** using the **Edit** buttons:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/consume-a-complex-web-service/http-authentication.png" alt="http-authentication" >}}

7. In the **SOAP Response** tab, you can configure the handling of the return from the web service call as follows:
    * If the return is a complex XML structure, select **Mapping** and use an XML-to-domain mapping to map the XML elements to the domain model entities:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/consume-a-complex-web-service/18581790.png" >}}

    * If the return is a primitive, you can store it in a variable by selecting **Store in variable** — **Yes**  and provide the **Type** and **Variable**:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/consume-a-complex-web-service/18581789.png" >}}

    * If you want to ignore the return, select **Ignore**
8. Your imported web service is now ready to be used in your application.
