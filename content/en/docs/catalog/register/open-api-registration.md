## 1 Introduction

OpenAPI automatic registration registers all your OpenAPI and OData APIs in the Catalog automatically when you app is deployed to the Mendix CLoud. This makes them easily discoverable within your organization.

## 2 Prerequisites

For OpenAPI, your app needs to be made using Mendix Studio Pro version 10.0 or above.

If your data sources are not hosted on Mendix Cloud, see [Register Data Sources](/catalog/register/) to explore alternative methods to register them.

## 3 Who Can Discover My APIs?

Once your APIs are registered in the Catalog, they become discoverable to other Mendix platform users within your organization.

You can manage API discoverability on a per-API basis, either from the curation pages or the API detail page. For more information, see the [Discoverable and Validated](/catalog/manage/curate/#discoverability) section of *Curate Registered Assets*.

## 4 What Does “Beta” Mean?

This feature is currently in [beta](/releasenotes/beta-features/), which means we are actively testing and improving it to better meet your needs.

We value your feedback, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts with us on the [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/catalog).
