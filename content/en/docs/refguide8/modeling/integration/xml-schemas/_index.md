## 1 Overview

An XML schema is defined in an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file and can be imported in your model. It describes what a certain XML document should look like. An example is shown in **Figure 1**. The schema can then be used in [Import Mappings](/refguide8/import-mappings/) and [Export Mappings](/refguide8/export-mappings/).
