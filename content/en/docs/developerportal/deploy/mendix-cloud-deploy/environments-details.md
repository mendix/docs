## 1 Introduction

To enter the **Environment details** page, go to the [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com), select your licensed app, click **Environments**, and then click **Details** on the specific environment. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/environment-details.png" >}}   

## 2 General Tab

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/environment-details-general.png" >}}   

The view of the **General** tab depends on the Mendix Cloud version on which the app is hosted. In this tab, you can find the following information about your environment:

*  **Status**
   * White – the environment is stopped or was never deployed
   * Green – the environment is working correctly
   * Orange – the environment has warnings
   * Red – the environment is not working correctly
        {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/environment-status.png" >}}   
* **Running since** date – the date on which the app was started
* **Name** – the type of environment (Test, Acceptance, Production or the name of a [flexible environment](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#flexible-environments)): see [Naming of Environments](#naming) for more information
* **URL** – the URL of the app
* **Project ID** – the unique identifier for your Mendix app
* **Environment ID** – the unique identifier of this environment
* **Custom domains** – the custom domains of the app
* **Java Version** – Oracle version 1.8 or AdoptOpenJDK version 8
* **Mendix Studios Target** – whether this environment is the one where apps will be deployed from Mendix Studio - see [Studio Deployment Settings](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/) for more information
* **Plan** – (*Cloud v4 only*) the type of plan covered by this license
* **Instances** – (*Cloud v4 only*) A summary of the number and memory allocation of *instances* of this environment: see [Scaling...](#scaling) for more information
* **Database Status** – (*Cloud v3 only*) this is **Running** by default
* **Database Version** – the PostgreSQL version that is supporting the database
* **Region** - the region where the app is hosted
* **Secondary Backup Location** the region where the backup is stored
* **Mendix Cloud Version** – Mendix Cloud v3/Mendix Cloud v4

At the bottom of the page there are three overview sections. These are described below in the [Overviews](#overviews) section.

### 2.1 Actions {#actions}

On the right side of the screen, you can find the following action buttons:

* **Restart Application** – this stops the running application and starts it again — this is necessary to apply new constant values or scheduled events to the environment
* **Start/Stop Application**
* **Clear Environment** *(only visible if your application is stopped)* – this allows you to empty all the data from your database and, optionally, remove the app and file storage from the environment as well — see [Clearing an Environment](#clear-environment), below, for more information
* **Show Logged in Users** 
* **Change Admin Password** – this changes the password for the inbuilt [administrator](/refguide/administrator/) account — the new password is applied immediately, without the need for a restart and will also force the administrator to pick up any new roles assigned in the app deployment package — see the [User Role](/refguide/administrator/#user-role) section of *Administrator* for more information

{{% alert color="info" %}}
During a [maintenance window](/developerportal/deploy/maintenance-windows/), you will not be able to start, restart, or stop your app.
{{% /alert %}}

#### 2.1.1 Clearing an Environment {#clear-environment}

You can use the **Clear Environment** button to clear your environment so that you can use it for another purpose. This option is only available if the environment is stopped.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You do not need to clear your environment if you are restoring an existing backup of the currently deployed app, the restore process will handle the existing data automatically.
{{% /alert %}}

When you click **Clear Environment** you will have two options:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/clear-environment.png" alt="Clear Environment options and confirmation"   width="400"  >}}

* **Only clear the database** – this empties all data from your database — after delete confirmation, the application will be stopped, the existing database will be deleted, a new database will be created, and the application will be restarted — ensure you have a backup of any data you want to keep
* **Clear the full environment (model and database)** *(default)* – this clears all data from your database and file storage, and removes your app from this environment — you should do this if you want to deploy a different app to this environment

You will need to confirm that you want to clear your environment by typing *clear* and clicking **Clear Environment**.

#### 2.1.2 Logging and Debugging in Mendix Cloud v4

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/actions-v4.png" >}}

In Mendix Cloud v4 environments, you have two additional action buttons:

* **View Live Log**
* **Show debugger information** – shows the settings needed to connect the debugger in Studio Pro to your app — for Mendix Cloud v4, the debugger is *always* enabled — for more information on debugging in the cloud, see [How To Debug Microflows Remotely](/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-remotely/)

#### 2.1.3 Logging and Debugging in Mendix Cloud v3

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Our Mendix Cloud V3 is deprecated, currently in a grace period, and will be retired at the beginning of Q3 2021. To continue running your licensed Mendix application on the Mendix Cloud, you need to migrate your app to Mendix Cloud V4. To learn more about Mendix Cloud V4 and how to migrate from Mendix Cloud V3, please visit the following page: [Migrate to Mendix Cloud V4](/developerportal/deploy/migrating-to-v4/). 
{{% /alert %}}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/actions-v3.png" >}}

In Mendix Cloud v3 environments, you have two additional action buttons:

* **View Current Log**
* **Enable/Disable Debugging** – enables or disables the debugger option — for more information about enabling the debugger, see [How to Debug Microflows Remotely](/howto7/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-remotely/)

### 2.2 Naming of Environments – Flexible Environments in Mendix Cloud v4 {#naming}

If you are the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) of the app, you can rename the environments as you wish.

Click the **Change** button next to the name of the environment.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The name must be at least two characters and consist of alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `-`) but cannot begin or end with a hyphen.

If you rename an environment, it may take up to 15 minutes before you can access an app via its URL. This is because the URL includes the name of the environment and the old value needs to be removed from the DNS cache. It may take considerably longer for the change to be visible worldwide.
{{% /alert %}}

### 2.3 Scaling – Mendix Cloud v4 {#scaling}

If your app is hosted in Mendix Cloud v4, you will see a section named **Instances** in the **General** tab. Click the **Change scaling** button to see the options for changing the scaling.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/scale.png" >}}

In **Scaling**, there are two sliders that you can control:

* Use the **Instances** slider to increase or decrease the amount from one to four instances by sliding the slider
   * The instances are meant for improved resiliency and increased processing power
   * The minimum amount of RAM memory per instances is 1GB; you can spread the RAM memory among four instances if you have more than 1GB of RAM memory
* Use the **Memory per instance** slider to increase or decrease the memory amount per instance by sliding the slider

The **Total Allocated Memory** is a process circle that shows how much memory is currently used for scaling.

{{% alert color="info" %}}The maximum value for **Memory per instance** equals the **Total Allocated Memory** of your plan, but it cannot exceed 32 GB. The maximum number of instances will change according to the **Memory per instance** you have chosen in such a way that `Max instances x Memory per instance = Total Allocated Memory`.{{% /alert %}}

If you have 1GB RAM of the **Total Allocated Memory**, you have one instance available to store your memory.

To scale your memory over multiple instances, you need more memory.

### 2.4 Overviews {#overviews}

At the bottom of the page, there are three overview grids with information about the information below.

#### 2.4.1 Deployment Package Details

In this section, you can find information about the deployment package that is currently loaded into the environment:

* **Name** of the deployment package
* **Version** of the deployment package
* **Runtime** version of Mendix used to create the app
* **Size (MB)** of the deployment package
* **Upload date** of the deployment package

#### 2.4.2 Plan Details - Mendix Cloud v4

This section shows details of the plan which applies to this environment.

#### 2.4.3 License

The license overview contains the following information:

* **Company** owning the license
* **Is Production** shows if this environment is licensed as a production environment
* **Expiration date**
* **Runtime mode** (Production, Acceptance, Test)
* **Limitations**
    * **Limitation type** (see below for details)
    * **Amount type**
    * **Number of allowed users**

The limitation types are the following:

* **Concurrent** – the number of named users that are logged in simultaneously
* **Concurrent anonymous** – the number of anonymous users that are logged in simultaneously
* **Named** – the number of named users registered in the database that are allowed to use the application

## 3 Model Options Tab {#model-options}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/model-options.png" >}}

On this tab, you can edit the model options described below.

### 3.1 Scheduled Events

In this section, you can view your configured scheduled events.

If you select a scheduled event and click **Toggle**, you can switch the scheduled event off and on.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

You have to restart your application before the changes will be made.

{{% /alert %}}

With scheduled events, you can let the Runtime execute a microflow at a specific moment in time. The event can also be repeated with a given interval (for example, every day).

For more information, see [Scheduled Events](/refguide/scheduled-events/).

### 3.2 Constants {#constants}

In this section, you can view the configured constants. Constants are used to define configuration values that can differ per environment.

To fill in a new value, select the constant and click **Edit**.

Here you can type a **New value**.

You can also set **Mask** to **Yes**. This replaces the **Current value** and the **New value** with asterisks on all screens in the Developer Portal. You will also get asterisks if you export the constants to Excel. This means that you can keep your constants secret from users who do not have edit rights.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/edit-constant.png" alt="Edit Constants Pop-up window"   width="50%"  >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You have to restart your application before the changes will be made.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information, see [Constants](/refguide/constants/).

## 4 Network Tab {#network-tab}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/network1.png"   width="50%"  >}}

On this tab, you can manage the elements described below.

### 4.1 Custom Domains

* **Domain name**
* **Certificate**
* **Expire** date

You can perform the following actions:

* **Create** (in which you have to provide the **domainname** and select the **certificate** from a drop-down menu)
* **Edit**
* **Delete**

For more information, see [Certificates](/developerportal/deploy/certificates/) and [Custom Domains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/).

### 4.2 HTTP Headers {#http-headers}

HTTP Headers allows you to set the values of selected HTTP response headers. These allow the server to pass additional information with the response which the browser will interpret to control the behavior of your Mendix app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This replaces the option to prevent embedding your app in an iframe with more flexible options to set HTTP Headers.
{{% /alert %}}

For the deprecated Mendix Cloud v3, only *X-Frame-Options* was supported. For Mendix Cloud v4 the HTTP headers which are supported in the Developer Portal are:

| Header | Description | Additional Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access-Control-Allow-Origin | indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin | |
| Content-Security-Policy | allows web site administrators to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page | a string value<br/>*see [Content Security Policy](#csp), below, for more information* |
| Referrer-Policy | governs which referrer information should be included with requests made | |
| X-Content-Type-Options | indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed | |
| X-Frame-Options | indicates whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>` or `<object>` | The default is not to allow apps to be rendered inside frames. <br/> This was the value set previously to prevent embedding in an iframe <br/> See [Running Your App in an Iframe](#iframe), below, for information about running your app inside an iframe. |
| X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies | specifies whether this page can load resources from a different domain | |
| X-XSS-Protection | stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks | |

There are three types of value for these headers:

*  Choose a value from a drop-down

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/http-header-dropdown.png" >}}

*  Choose a value from a drop-down and specify a URL

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/http-header-url.png" >}}

*  Enter the required values as a string

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/http-header-string.png" >}}

The changes to the headers will be implemented when the app is redeployed.

Additional information can be found in the Mozilla developer guide [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).

#### 4.2.1 HTTP Response Headers Inserted Automatically

A number of non-configurable response headers are added automatically by Mendix and the deployment environment. These are listed below.

| Response Header | Added in |
| --- | --- |
| cache-control| the buildpack for index.html and login.html — the Mendix Runtime for other pages |
| strict-transport-security | TLS terminating webservers - this is set to `max-age=31536000` |
| x-vcap-request-id | Cloud Foundry to track requests through CF |

#### 4.2.2 Running Your App in an Iframe {#iframe}

Most browsers have additional security to ensure that iframes are only allowed when they are from the same domain as the main page. The defaults for these vary by browser version. This security is controlled through SameSite cookies. You can find a good explanation of SameSite cookies in [SameSite cookies explained](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/) on the *web.dev* website.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
There can be additional issues when using cookies in iframes for end-users using the **Safari** browser. Resolving these issues is outside the control of Mendix. See the [Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking and More](https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/) blog post on *Webkit.org* for more information.
{{% /alert %}}

##### 4.2.2.1 Using Custom Domains

To avoid security issues when you want to embed the app in an iframe, we recommend that you use [custom domains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/) to ensure that the app you want to embed is part of the same domain. For example, if your page is mainpage.domain.name, then the app embedded in the iframe should be appname.domain.name.

##### 4.2.2.2 Applying a Different SameSite Setting

From **Mendix version 8.12**, you can control the value of SameSite in your cookies. The default for all cookies depends on the version of Mendix you are using:

* for Mendix version 8 (8.12 and above), the default is `SameSite=None`, which means that they *can* be used in an iframe
* for Mendix version 9.0 and above, the default is `SameSite=Strict`, which means that they *cannot* be used in an iframe

You can change this value in the `com.mendix.core.SameSiteCookies` [custom runtime setting](#custom-runtime-settings) if you want to change iframe restrictions for your app.

For **Mendix versions below 8.12** there was no SameSite value set on cookies and the behavior is dependent on the browser default. To ensure that cookies can be used within iframes, you can set the custom environment variable `SAMESITE_COOKIE_PRE_MX812` to `true` in [custom environment variables](#custom-environment-variables), which will set `SameSite=None; Secure;` for all your cookies.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The SAMESITE_COOKIE_PRE_MX812 setting will only be implemented the next time your app is deployed.
{{% /alert %}}

##### 4.2.2.3 Using Custom Sign In Pages

If you use a custom sign in page, your **index.html** will probably set the `originURI` cookie. If your Mendix app runs within an iframe, this cookie needs to be set with the `SameSite=None` and `Secure` attributes.

To do this, find all the places in your theme folder where this cookie is set. It will look like `document.cookie = "originURI=/login.html"`.
Change this to add the required attributes. For example, `document.cookie = "originURI=/login.html" + (window.location.protocol === "https:" ? ";SameSite=None;Secure" : "")`.

#### 4.2.3 Content Security Policy {#csp}

A Content Security Policy informs the client (browser) where your page will load resources from. Setting this can make your app more secure by declaring trusted sources for your resources. For more information see the W3C recommendation [Content Security Policy Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/).

Setting a full content security policy is dependent on what your app does. However, a starting point which declares the content security policy which works with a basic Mendix app is given below:

```code
default-src 'self' ; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' ; connect-src 'self' ; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com data: ; img-src 'self' data: ; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com ; base-uri 'self' ; form-action 'self' ; object-src 'none' ; frame-ancestors 'self' ;
```

If you have issues which appear to be related to a content security policy, you can use the console of your browser to investigate them.

### 4.3 Outgoing Connections Whitelisting (Mendix Cloud Dedicated){#connection-whitelist}

If you are deploying your apps to [Mendix Cloud Dedicated](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/app-capabilities/mendix-cloud-overview#mendix-cloud-vpc), all outgoing IP addresses will be allowed by default.

If you uncheck the **Allow all outgoing connections** option, you can define which IP addresses and ports can be used for outgoing connections in this section.

You can add or edit a number of different IP address and port combinations. Any ranges which have already been set up will be listed here. You can do the following:

* Select **Allow all outgoing connections** to remove any restrictions, or deselect it to impose restrictions
* Click **New** to add a new range
* Select an existing range and click **Edit** to edit an existing range
* Select an existing range and click **Delete** to delete an existing range (you will be asked to confirm that you want to delete this range)

#### 4.3.1 Managing a Whitelist Range

For each range where you define whitelisted IP addresses and ports, you can enter the following information:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/whitelist.png" >}}

* **Name** – A name to identify this range
* **IP** – An inclusive range of whitelisted IP addresses in IPv4 format. All the IP addresses must be in a public range, see [Valid IP Ranges](#valid-ip), below. All addresses between the **Start** address and the **End** address will be whitelisted, including the start and end addresses. If you only want to whitelist a single address, make the start and end addresses the same
* **Port** – An inclusive range of ports which will be whitelisted for the IP range above. You can use several whitelist entries if you want to whitelist different port ranges for the same IP range
* **Protocol** – You can specify whether the whitelisting is for **TCP**, **UDP**, or **ALL** traffic
* **Description** – an optional description of this IP range, for example which API it supports

Click **Save** to save your range. The new values will be applied within a few minutes without needing an app restart.

#### 4.3.2 Valid IP Ranges {#valid-ip}

IP Addresses must be within the following ranges:

| IP Start | IP End |
| --- | --- |
| 0.0.0.0 | 9.255.255.255 |
| 11.0.0.0 | 169.253.255.255 |
| 169.255.0.0 | 172.15.255.255 |
| 172.32.0.0 | 192.167.255.255 |
| 192.169.0.0 | 255.255.255.255 |

### 4.4 Path-Based Access Restrictions {#path-based-restrictions}

You can restrict access to your application by means of Client Certificates or IP ranges.

The top level path (`/`) restricts access to the entire application. Settings for specific paths override the implicitly inherited profile for the top level.

Custom access restriction profiles are managed at the application level. They can be reused for all environments (acceptance, production, etc).

The **Path based access restrictions** overview contains the following information:

* **Path**
* **Current Restriction Profile**
* **New Restriction Profile**

You can **Delete** a path or you can **Add** and **Edit** a path with the following restriction types:

* Allow all access
* Deny all access
* Custom Profile for Client Certificates and/or IP ranges
* N/A (inherit)

For more information, see [How to Restrict Access for Incoming Requests](/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/).

### 4.5 Outgoing Connections Certificates

Add client certificates (in the PKCS12 format) or certificate authorities (in the PEM format). These will be used when your application initiates SSL/TLS connections.

## 5 Log Levels Tab {#log-levels}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/loglevels-tab.png" >}}   

Log levels are used to distinguish the log messages and to highlight the highest priority ones so that they can receive the immediate intervention they require. Note that custom log nodes appear in the list only after a message has been logged to them. See [Log Message](/refguide/log-message/#log-node-name) for more information.

On this tab, you can perform the following actions:

* Change the log level type by clicking the specific level
* Click **Set all to INFO** to revert all the changes

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If your app is not running, you will only see log nodes which are not set to the `Info` level. You will see these log nodes again when your app is restarted and, for custom nodes, messages have been logged to them.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you change the log level, this level will continue to be used even if you later restart your app.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
For an application running a **single instance**, any changes will be applied immediately to the application.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
For an application running **more than one instance**, the changes can only be applied after a restart of the app. This is because it is not possible to instruct the load balancer to set the log level for a specific running instance. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Log levels may not persist across restarts if you change them outside the Developer Portal (for example, using an app module).
{{% /alert %}}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/loglevels.png" >}}

The log level types are the following:

| Level | Color | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trace** | | More detailed information. These are only written to logs. |
| **Debug** | | Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. |
| **Info**  | | Confirmation that things are working as expected. |
| **Warning** | Orange | Indicates that something unexpected happened or that there is some problem in the near future (for example, "disk space low"). The application is still working as expected. |
| **Error** | Red | Due to a more serious problem, the application has not been able to perform some function. |
| **Critical** | White (text), red (background) | A serious error has occurred, indicating that the application itself may be unable to continue running. |

For more information about log levels, see [How to Set Log Levels](/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/log-levels/).

## 6 Runtime Tab {#runtime-tab}

On this tab, you can add **Custom Runtime Settings** and **Custom Environment Variables**

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/runtime.png" >}}   

### 6.1 Custom Runtime Settings {#custom-runtime-settings}

Use the Custom Runtime Settings section to perform the following actions:

* **Add** a new runtime **setting** with a new **value**
* **Edit** the runtime setting
* **Delete** the runtime settings

For more information about runtime settings, read the [Runtime Customization](/refguide/custom-settings/) and [Advanced Custom Settings in Mendix Runtime](/refguide/tricky-custom-runtime-settings/) documentation.

The Mendix Cloud uses runtime settings to configure the included systems for logs, backups, and database. Therefore, the following settings are **not** configurable by users:

* `CACertificates`
* `ClientCertificatePasswords`
* `ClientCertificates`
* `com.mendix.core.localfilesystem.cleaning.isEnabled`
* `com.mendix.core.localfilesystem.cleaning.time`
* `com.mendix.storage.azure.*`
* `com.mendix.storage.s3.*`
* `DatabaseHost`
* `DatabaseJdbcUrl`
* `DatabaseName`
* `DatabasePassword`
* `DatabaseType`
* `DatabaseUserName`
* `DatabaseUseSsl`
* `DTAPMode`
* `EnableSessionFingerprinting`
* `JavaKeyStorePassword`
* `LogFileName`
* `MaxLogFileCount`
* `MaxLogFileSize`
* `MicroflowConstants`
* `MyScheduledEvents`
* `OracleServiceName`
* `ScheduledEventExecution`
* `TempPath`
* `WebServiceClientCertificates`

### 6.2 Custom Environment Variables {#custom-environment-variables}

Use the Custom Environment Variables to **add**, **Edit**, or **Delete** an environment variable.

Unlike the Custom Runtime Settings, most of the variables you add are chosen from a drop-down list.

Select **Supported** and you can choose from the following variables:

* **APPMETRICS_TARGET** – setting this enables business events to be sent to a different monitoring solution from the technical events
* **DD_API_KEY** – the API key used with Datadog
* **DD_LOG_LEVEL** – the log level of logging sent to Datadog
* **DD_SITE** – directs metrics to a specific Datadog region
* **DATABASE_CONNECTION_PARAMS** – Additional JDBC parameters for PostgreSQL databases, see the [Mendix Cloud Foundry Buildpack](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack) for more information
* **METRICS_AGENT_CONFIG** – passes a configuration JSON to control the metrics passed to Datadog
* **SAMESITE_COOKIE_PRE_MX812** – set `SameSite=None;Secure` for all cookies coming from the Mendix runtime, as described in the [Running Your App in an Iframe](#iframe) section
* **USAGE_METRICS_EMAIL_FIELDS** – if your app uses specializations of the `System.User` entity to store users, use this variable to point to the them. This enables us to identify internal and external users of your app. The value of this variable is in the format `Module.Entity.Attribute`, where `Module` is the module of your app which contains the `Entity` that is a specialization of `System.User` and `Attribute` is the attribute that contains the email address of the user. If you have multiple specializations of `System.User`, you can specify the values in comma-separated format. That is `Module1.Entity1.Attribute1,Module2.Entity2.Attribute2,…,ModuleN.EntityN.AttributeN`. In the following example there are two specializations identified: `Administration.Account.Email,MendixSSO.MendixSSOUser.EmailAddress`.

In addition, to support features which are in beta, you can add **Unsupported** environment variables. If you are involved in using a beta feature, you will be told what **Name** needs to be entered here and what the **Value** should be.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/environment-variable.png" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The *Unsupported* environment variables can only be used for controlling Mendix beta features.
{{% /alert %}}

## 7 Maintenance Tab {#maintenance-tab}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-details/maintenance.png" >}}   

There are two types of maintenance:

* Regular weekly maintenance (which does not affect your app), during which you can change the preferred maintenance window
* Planned maintenance (which will affect your app in some ways), about which you will automatically receive an email and you can override the maintenance window if necessary

For more information about maintenance, see [Maintenance Windows: Configuration](/developerportal/deploy/maintenance-windows/).

### 7.1 Preferred Maintenance Window

You can view and change the preferred maintenance.

### 7.2 Planned Maintenance

When a maintenance operation is planned, it will show up under **Planned Maintenance**. By default, this will be planned in your preferred maintenance window. You can override the maintenance window of a specific maintenance operation by clicking **Override**.

You will automatically receive **email notifications** about planned maintenance.

## 8 Tags Tab

You can set tags on your environment. These are arbitrary strings that are not interpreted by the Developer Portal. Tags serve two purposes:

* Custom tags can be added to metrics for third-party metrics solutions
* Tags can serve as selection criteria for grouping environments into a landscape management dashboard which can be used for third-party logging solutions

For example, you may wish to use tags when logging with *Datadog*. You can find more information on this at [Getting started with tags](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging/) on the *Datadog* site.
