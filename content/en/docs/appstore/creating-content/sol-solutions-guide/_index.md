## Introduction

This section provides information and guidance on how to develop solutions you can sell both on and off the Mendix Marketplace.

## What Is a Solution?

A solution is any Mendix app that is suitable to be sold to multiple different customers. This means the app is built to match the needs and expectations of a wider range of customers. Sometimes this means the app is configurable at runtime to better cater to the needs of groups of customers. In this case, general Mendix development [best practices](/refguide/dev-best-practices/) apply, and you can get started building a solution with any template available on the Mendix Platform.

Customers often require more from a solution than it supports out of the box. Whether it is an integration with an existing system in the customer's IT landscape, a change to better match the processes of the customer, or simply an adjusted UI to better match the brand of the customer, these adaptations require more than just a prescriptive software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution. This means you need to enable the solution to be adapted so that it can fit the specific needs of a customer.

For more details on how to combine out-of-the-box logic with customer adaptations, see [Introduction to Adaptable Solutions](/appstore/creating-content/sol-adapt/).
