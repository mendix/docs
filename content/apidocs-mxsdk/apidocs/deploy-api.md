## 1 Introduction

The Deploy API allows you to manage application environments in the Mendix Cloud. You can retrieve the status of, and start and stop, applications. You can also configure new model versions and deploy them to application environments. To create and manage deployment packages you need, in addition, the Build API .

This image provides a domain model representation of the concepts discussed below and how these are related:

![](attachments/deploy-api/api-model.png)

## 2 Authentication

The Deploy API requires authentication via API keys that are bound to your Mendix account (for more information, see [Authentication](authentication)).

As APIs are designed for automated systems, the Deploy API does not require the two-factor authentication which is normally required to make changes to production environments. This is a potential security risk. Therefore, the Technical Contact of an application needs to allow API access explicitly for team members that want to use the Deploy API. This can be configured from the **Node Security** screen under **Project Settings**. By default, API access is already enabled for test and acceptance environments for all team members. To perform an action via the Deploy API, such as transporting a new deployment package, both the **Transport** and **API Access** permissions need to be enabled.

## 3 API Calls

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Only _Retrieve apps_, _Create Sandbox_ and _Retrieve app_ API calls are supported for sandbox applications. Please note that most API calls — with the exception of _Upload Package_ — require that the _Content-Type_ header be set to _application/json_.
