Tables can be used to change the layout of the form. They contain a number of rows and columns and the intersection of the two is called a cell. Each cell can contain widgets. Cells can be merged horizontally and vertically to allow for asymmetric layouts.
Tables can be used both in- and outside the data view or templategrid widgets.
