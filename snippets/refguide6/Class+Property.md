### Class

The class property allows you to specify a cascading style sheet (CSS) class for the widget. This class will be applied to the widget in the browser and the widget will get the corresponding styling. You can use more than one class, separated by a space. The classes should be classes from the theme that is used in the project. Using the class property overrules the default styling of the widget.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

Note that the styling is applied in the following order:<br />
<br />
1.  Default styling defined by the theme the project uses.<br />
2.  The 'Class' property of the widget.<br />
3.  The 'Style' property of the widget.

</div>
