## 1 Introduction 

In this document, we will explain how to solve the most common consistency errors that can occur when configuring microflows in Mendix Studio. For more information on microflows, see [Microflows](microflows).

An example of a consistency error is when you set a drag and drop a **Create Object** activity to the microflow, but do not specify what entity should be used as a data source to create the object.

## 2 Properties Not Set Consistency Errors 

Many errors occur if you do not set properties (for example, a data source) for an element or an activity. The most common errors of this type are described in the table below:

| Error Code | Text in the Checks Panel                                     | Element/ Activity                                            | Cause of an Error                                            | Way to Fix                                                   |

| CE0080     | 'Condition' is required. You can set it in properties.       | [Decision](microflows-decision)                              | You have added an decision to your microflow, but did not specify any condition for it. | Configure condition for the decision: open **Properties** > **Data Source** and specify **Condition**. |
| CE0079     | The 'true' case should be configured in properties for an outgoing flow. | [Decision](microflows-decision)                              | You have added an decision to your microflow, and set an [attribute](domain-models-attributes) of the Boolean type as a **Condition** but did not configure a case for the true value. | Open the properties of the decision, in the **Cases** option click **New Case** > **Edit**. The **Decision Value** properties will open, in the  **Value** option select **True**. |
| CE0079     | The 'false' case should be configured in properties for an outgoing flow. | [Decision](microflows-decision)                              | You have added an decision to your microflow, and set an [attribute](domain-models-attributes) of the Boolean type as a **Condition** but did not configure a case for the false value. | Open the properties of the decision, in the **Cases** option click **New Case** > **Edit**.

| CE0012     | A list is required. You can set it in properties.            | Aggregate List                                               | You have added an **Aggregate List** activity to your microflow but did not select a list variable for it. | Open the properties of **Aggregate List** and select a list in **Data Source** > **List**. |
| CE0015     | An attribute is required for the selected 'Operation'. You can set it in properties. | Aggregate List: Calculate Sum, Calculate Average, Calculate Maximum, Calculate Minimum operations | You have added an **Aggregate List** activity to your microflow and set **Operation** in the properties to **Calculate Sum**, **Calculate Average**, **Calculate Maximum**, **Calculate Minimum**, but did not select an attribute which the **Operation** would be applied to. | Open the properties of **Aggregate List** and select an attribute in **Behavior** > **Attribute**, or change **Operation** to **Count**. |
| CE0031     | An object is required. You can set it in properties.         | Change Object                                                | You have added a **Change Object** activity to your microflow but did not specify a variable for it. | Open **Properties** of **Change Object** > **Data Source** and set **Variable**. |

| CE0136     | Retrieve object must specify an entity. You can set it in properties. | Retrieve                                                     | The reasons of this error can be the following ones: <ul><li>You have added a **Retrieve** activity to your microflow and set **Source** > **By Association** in properties, but  did not select an association</li><li>You have added a **Retrieve** activity to your microflow and set **Source** > **From Database** in properties, but did not select an entity</li></ul> | Open the properties of **Retrieve** and set an association (for **Source** > **By Association** ) or an entity (for **Source** > **From Database**) in the **Data Source** section. |
| CE0018     | An association is required for the ‘By Association’ data source.

## 3 Properties Set Incorrectly Consistency Errors

If you have not configured properties of an element or an activity correctly, you will get consistency errors. For example, you have set an attribute of the integer type for an decision, when only Boolean and enumeration types are allowed for it. 

The most common errors of this type are described in the table below. 

| Error Code | Text in the Checks Panel                                     | Element/ Activity                | Cause of an Error                                            | Way to Fix                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CE0078     | Condition should be of type Boolean or enumeration but is of type {type of condition}. | [Decision](microflows-decision)  | You have configured an invalid condition expression in the decision properties. The condition expression should return a Boolean or an enumeration. | Expression should return a Boolean or an enumeration: open the decision properties > **Data Source** > **Condition**, and select a variable or an attribute of Boolean or enumeration type. |
|            | Value must be of type {type of value}.                       | [Decision](microflows-decision)  | You have configured a condition for the decision which does not result in a Boolean or enumeration, so the selected split condition is invalid. | Open the decision properties > **Data Source** > **Condition** and configure a condition that results in a Boolean or enumeration. |
| CE0108     | Variable {variable name} is defined but not in scope at this location. | Change Variable                  | You have added a **Change Variable** activity to the microflow before an activity that creates this variable. | Change the order of the activities in the microflow placing the activity that creates a variable first. Only after that you will be able to change it: add a **Create Variable** activity before **Change Variable**. |
| CE0109     | Undefined variable {variable name}                           | Create Variable/ Change Variable | A variable that is not available anymore is used in the microflow. You have deleted an activity that provided the variable. **Parameter**, **Create Object**, or **Create Variable** can provide variables for the microflow, and that variable was used for **Create Variable** or **Change Variable** activities. | Add an activity that will provide the microflow with a variable that is missing, or select another variable for the **Create Variable**/ **Change Variable** activity in properties. |
| CE0161     | Error(s) in the filter conditions. Open 'Filter' of the Retrieve action and check the marked conditions | A filter of a Retrieve action    | A filter condition is no longer valid.                       | Open properties of the **Retrieve** activity > **Filter** and check the conditions that are marked in red. |

## 4 Errors Connected with Studio Pro Settings

Some consistency errors may be connected with settings in Mendix Studio Pro. The most common errors of this type are described in the table below. 

| Error Code | Text in the Checks Panel                                     | Element/ Activity | Cause of an Error                                            | Way to Fix                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|            | The selected microflow {name of the microflow} no longer exists. | Microflow         | You have deleted a microflow that is selected in Studio Pro > **Project Settings** > **Runtime** > **After startup** or **Before shutdown** options. For more information on **After startup** /**Before shutdown** microflows, see section [7 After-Startup and Before-Shutdown Microflows](/refguide/clustered-mendix-runtime#startup-shutdown-microflows) in Clustered Mendix Runtime in the *Runtime category*. | There two ways to fix the error: <ul><li>In Studio: create a microflow with the same name</li><li>In Studio Pro: open **Project** > **Settings**, in the **Project Settings** pop-up dialog  open the **Runtime** tab and either select a different microflow for **After startup** / **Before shutdown** options, or set these options to **None**.</li></ul> |
| CE0142     | After startup microflow should return a boolean.             | Microflow         | This microflow is selected in Studio Pro > **Project Settings** > **Runtime** > **After startup** or **Before shutdown** options, and should return a Boolean. For more information on **After startup** /**Before shutdown** microflows, see section [7 After-Startup and Before-Shutdown Microflows](/refguide/clustered-mendix-runtime#startup-shutdown-microflows) in Clustered Mendix Runtime in *Runtime category*. | Open the properties of the microflow's end event > the **Return Value** section, select **Value** option > set **Data Type** to Boolean and configure the **Value**. |
