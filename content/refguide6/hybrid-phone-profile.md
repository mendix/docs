The documentation in this section describes a new feature that is still in beta, and is subject to change before the final release.

{{% /alert %}}

When the Hybrid Phone profile is enabled, every user that accesses the Mendix application from a PhoneGap hybrid application running on a phone device will automatically be redirected to this profile. If the Hybrid Phone profile is disabled, phone users will be redirected to the [Hybrid Tablet Profile](hybrid-tablet-profile). If there is no Hybrid Tablet profile, users will be redirected to the [Desktop Profile](desktop-profile).
