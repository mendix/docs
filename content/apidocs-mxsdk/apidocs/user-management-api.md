## 1 Introduction

The User Management API allows your company's user management systems to integrate with the Mendix Platform. Through this API, you can create and manage user accounts in your company. Additionally you can create and manage groups. In the Mendix Platform, you can define group policies for groups which grant access to your company's applications to their members.

## 2 Authentication

The User Management API requires its users with the required permissions to authenticate themselves. This can be done by using API keys; for more information about this please refer to [this article](authentication).

## 3 Error Handling

If an error occurs while performing a REST request, the server will always return a JSON object with error information. For example:

```json
{
    "errorMessage": "Authentication failed. The HTTP headers 'Mendix-Username' and 'Mendix-ApiKey' should contain valid credentials to authenticate for this request.",
    "errorCode": "UNAUTHORIZED"
}

```

The **errorCode** attribute describes the error in a machine-readable form, which may provide additional details on the nature of the error in addition to the HTTP status. The **errorMessage** attribute is the human-readable representation of the error, intended to give the developer further insight in the cause of the error.

The following errors might be returned by the service. In general, 4xx errors indicate that something was wrong with the client's request, and 5xx errors indicate that something went wrong at the server.

| Status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 400 (Bad Request) | The requester made an incorrect call. Either the JSON was not well formed or the request arguments were invalid. The "message" field will elaborate on the error. |
| 401 (Unauthorized) | The credentials are not valid or not applicable |
| 403 (Forbidden) | The credentials are valid, but are not authorized to perform this request. |
| 404 (Not Found) | This service or resource does not exist. Please verify the URL you are using. |
| 405 (Method Not allowed) | A service exists for this URL, but not in combination with the used HTTP method. |
| 409 (Conflict) | There was a conflict with respect to the resource; for example, the resource which was attempted to be created already exists. |
| 500 (Internal Server Error) / 560 (Internal Server Error) | The request is valid, but we failed to serve it. Please contact Support. |
| 502 (Bad Gateway) / 503 (Service Unavailable) | The server is currently offline. Please contact Support if this problem persists. |
| 504 (Gateway timeout) | Your request is being processed but the server aborted the response because the request took too long. Note that the request might have been applied still. Please contact Support if this happens. |

### 3.1 Error Codes

On errors (4xx and 5xx responses), the response can contain an errorCode. This is a request-specific code that describes the error in a machine-readable form. The API documentation describes possible error codes per request.

#### 3.1.1 Authentication & Authorization Error Codes

The following error codes can be returned on authentication and authorization errors.

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| UNAUTHORIZED
401 | Authentication failed. Credentials provided with the request are either invalid or incomplete. |
| FORBIDDEN
403 | Authentication succeeded, but user is not authorized to execute this request. |

#### 3.1.2 General Error Codes

##### 3.1.2.1 Client Errors (4xx)

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PARAMETER_MISSING
400 | One of the required parameters for the request is missing or does not contain a value. |
| BAD_PARAMETER
400 | One of the parameters included with the request has an illegal value. |
| RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND
404 | The requested resource cannot be found on the server. |
| RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS

## 4 API Calls

### 4.1 Concepts

The following concepts are used within this API.

#### 4.1.1 User Account {#user-account}

Users that are able to sign in to the Mendix Platform with their credentials are identified by their log in name (an email address) or OpenID (an identifier generated by Mendix to uniquely identify a user). Both values are unique within the Mendix Platform and cannot change over time. Every user is a member of (exactly) one Company.

#### 4.1.2 Company (Account) {#company-account}

A group of users that work for the same legal entity. Companies can own email domains (for example "@acme.org"), which means that every new user that signs up with an email address within this domain will become part of the domain owning company. (Additional) email domains for a company can be requested through [Control Center](/developerportal/control-center/) or[Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/).

#### 4.1.3 Groups

A group of users within the same company. Automated security policies can be assigned to groups. These groups typically reflect your organization's structure.
