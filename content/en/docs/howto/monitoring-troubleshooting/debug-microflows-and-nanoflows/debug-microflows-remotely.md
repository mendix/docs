## 1 Introduction

In addition to debugging a local deployment of your app, it is also possible to debug applications that are already in a cloud environment.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
These instructions are for apps running in Mendix Cloud v4. If you are running an older version of Mendix which is deployed to Mendix Cloud v3 you need the previous version of this document here: [Debug Microflows Remotely](/howto7/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-remotely/).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
**Debugging in a production environment is not recommended.**

If you are debugging in the cloud, be aware of other app end-users. Breakpoints in the debugger will pause processes for all users of the app in this environment.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
**It is currently not possible to debug nanoflows remotely.** If you are debugging in the cloud, any breakpoint added to a nanoflow will be disabled.
{{% /alert %}}

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Connect the debugger in Studio Pro to your Mendix Cloud v4 environment

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Have access as a team member to a Mendix app deployed to a [licensed](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps/) Mendix Cloud v4 environment
* Have **TRANSPORT RIGHTS** to the app environment you want to debug in the app's [node permissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/)

## 3 The Basics

In Mendix Cloud v4, the debugger is always listening for connections so you cannot turn it on or off. To debug your app in the cloud, you need to get a URL and a password from the app environment and provide that information to Studio Pro. The steps below explain how to do this.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The debugger supports only debugging of single-instance environments. Multi-instance environments need to be scaled down to one instance before the debugger can be used. See [Scaling Your Environment in Mendix Cloud v4](/developerportal/deploy/scale-environment/) for more information.

### 3.1 Obtain Debugging Credentials

#### 3.1.1 Obtain Debugging Credentials from Mendix cloud

When your application is in the Mendix cloud:

1. Open your app in the [Developer Portal](https://home.mendix.com).

2. Click **Environments** in the left sidebar.

3. In the **Deploy** tab, click **Details** for the environment which you want to debug:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/18580051.png" >}}

4. In the **General** tab, click **Show Debugger Information**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/show-debugger-information.png" >}}

    This invokes the **Debugger settings** pop-up window which provides a URL (such as `http://yourapp.mendixcloud.com/debugger/`) and a password:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/debugger-settings.png" >}}

You will need to provide these credentials to Studio Pro to connect the debugger to the app running in the cloud.

#### 3.1.2 Obtain Debugging Credentials from Private Cloud Connected{#private-cloud}

If your application is on a connected Private Cloud, you can get the credentials from the Developer Portal:

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
You can only remotely debug apps deployed to Private Cloud for Mendix if you are using Mendix Operator version 1.6.0 or above.
{{% /alert %}}

1. Open your app in the [Developer Portal](https://home.mendix.com).

2. Click **Environments** in the left sidebar.

3. Click **Details** for the environment which you want to debug.

4. Open the **Debugger** tab:

5. If the debugger is currently disabled, click **Enable Debugger**. You will be asked to confirm the generated strong password. We recommend that you do not change this password.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/pc-debugger-password.png" alt="Enter password for the private cloud debugger" >}}

    You will receive a warning that you have made some changes. Click **Apply Changes** to restart the app and apply the changes.

Once the debugger is enabled, you will see the **URL** and **Password** which are the credentials you need to supply to Studio Pro. Use the **Copy to clipboard** links to simplify providing the credentials.

{{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/pc-debug-tab.png" >}}

When the debugger is enabled, you can click **Disable Debugger** to disable it. You will be asked to confirm your choice and will receive a warning that you have made some changes. Click **Apply Changes** to restart the app and apply the changes.

#### 3.1.3 Obtain Debugging Credentials from SAP S/4 HANA Cloud

If your application is on the SAP S/4 HANA cloud, you will need to set the password in the SAP Cockpit:

1. Log in to the SAP Cockpit and go to your application's settings page.

2. Go to your application > **User-Provided Variables**.

3. Click on the button 'Add variable' and add 'DEBUGGER_PASSWORD' and the password. Both are case-sensitive.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/debugger-settings-saps4hana.png" alt="SAP Cockpit showing user-provided variables" >}}

4. Restart your application.

#### 3.1.4 Obtain Debugging Credentials from Windows Mendix Service Console

If your application is deployed to a Microsoft Windows environment, you will need to obtain the password from the Windows Mendix Service Console

1. Start your app.

2. Go to the **Advanced** menu of the Windows Mendix Service Console.

3. Select **Enable debugging** and copy the password which is displayed in the popup.

The debugger is available at `{appURL}/debugger/` using the default runtime server port.

If you are debugging your app running behind IIS, make sure the debugger path is forwarded to the right runtime location as described in the [Reverse Proxy Inbound Rules](/developerportal/deploy/deploy-mendix-on-microsoft-windows/#reverse-proxy-rules) section of *Microsoft Windows – deploy*.

### 3.2 How to Enable Cloud Debugging in Studio Pro

Once you have the unique URL and password, there are two methods for connecting Studio Pro to the cloud environment. 

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
If you do cannot connect the debugger, then you do not have sufficient permissions to your app. Ask the Technical Contact or the app Scrum Master to provide the correct permissions.
{{% /alert %}}

1. Open the **Connect Debugger** dialog box – you can do this in two ways within Studio Pro:

    * Go to the **Run** menu and select **Connect Debugger…**:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/18580048.png" >}}
        
    * Click **Connect…** in the **Debugger** pane:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/debugger-pane.png" >}}

2. In the **Connect Debugger** dialog box set the following:

    * **Connect to** – select the option *An app running in the Mendix Cloud or on another remote server.*
    * **URL** – the *URL* from the **Debugger Settings** for your app environment
    * **Password** – the *Password* from the **Debugger Settings** for your app environment

        {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/debug-microflows-and-nanoflows/debug-microflows-remotely/18580047.png" >}}

3. Click **OK**.

The debugger is now connected to your app running in the cloud.
