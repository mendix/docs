## 1 Introduction {#studio-overview}

Mendix Studio is the place where you can create, view and edit your Mendix applications without going into technical details. For this purpose you can use the [Studio Pro](/refguide7/desktop-modeler/) and [develop apps together with Studio Pro users](/studio7/general-collaborative-development/) anytime. 

With Studio you can create and edit applications in your browser without installing software on your PC.   

The picture below shows the components of Studio's interface:

## 2 Opening Studio

### 2.1 Opening Studio via Developer Portal {#opening-studio-via-dev-portal}

If you do not see **Edit in Studio**, go to [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) in the Developer Portal and [enable Studio](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#web).

### 2.2 Opening Studio via Studio Pro {#opening-via-studio-pro}

## 3 Studio Upgrade

After clicking **Edit in Studio** you may need to upgrade your app to the latest version.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When you upgrade your app in Studio to the latest  Mendix version, you will need to upgrade your app in the Studio Pro to the same version as well. 

If you are working in a team with others, it is wise to check with your team members if everyone is OK to upgrade the app to the latest Mendix version. The reason for this is that once you update Studio, you need to update Studio Pro as well.

## 8 Cut/Copy/Paste Function 

Cut/copy/paste function is available in all editors of Studio: pages, microflows, domain models, and navigation. To cut/copy/paste you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> /  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> or  <kbd>Cmn</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> /  <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. 

Mind the following characteristics when using cut/copy/paste:

* You can cut/copy/paste elements within one editor; that means that you can cut/copy/paste elements within one page or to other pages in Studio, and copy microflow activities within one microflow or to other microflows
* You can cut/copy/paste elements to different apps in Studio if they have the same Mendix version
* You cannot copy/paste pages or microflows, only elements of a page or a microflow 
* You cannot cut/copy/paste from Studio to Studio Pro
