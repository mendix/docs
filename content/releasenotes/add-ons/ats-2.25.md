## 2.25

**Release date: November 2nd, 2021**

### Improvements 

* The ATS source code and model has been upgraded to Mendix [8.18.7](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.18#8187).
* The ATS Job running web service no longer needs a username and password combination to authenticate the requests. The API token is enough to authenticate the request.
