### Class

The class property allows you to specify a cascading style sheet (CSS) class that applies to the entire document and its contents. This class will be applied in the browser and can affect how a page is rendered. The class should be a class from the project's theme.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

Note that the styling is applied in the following order: 1) Default styling defined by the theme the project uses. 2) The 'Class' property of the widget. 3) The 'Style' property of the widget.

</div>
