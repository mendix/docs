## 1 Introduction

You may want to send email from your apps running in the Mendix Cloud via, for instance, the [Email](/appstore/connectors/email-connector/) connector. After you have installed this you will need to configure an SMTP server in your application. There are several options:

| Service | Mendix Cloud | Free App environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Amazon Simple Email Service** | &#x2713;    | &#x2713; |
| **Gmail** | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| **MailGun** | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| **SendGrid** | &#x2713; | &#x2713;    |
| **Other SMTP-compatible services** | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| **Mendix Mail Servers** | &#x2717; | &#x2717; |

For apps deployed to the Mendix Cloud you must setup a third-party mail provider to send emails from your app.

## 2 External Email Providers

In general we recommend external services as these offer specialized tools for sending e-mail, working with spam filters, keeping track of sent e-mail and giving insights into your target reach via analytics tools.

The [Email](/appstore/connectors/email-connector/) connector from the Marketplace is compatible with all providers that offer an SMTP interface. You can also use other ways of sending e-mail using an external service, such as REST APIs or creating your own Java actions to send e-mail.

To use an external provider, you will need to sign up for an account with them and use their SMTP settings which include:

* Host
* Port
* SSL/TLS
* Username
* Password

Frequently used providers (A-Z) are:

* [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) [[settings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/smtp-connect.html)]
* [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) [[settings](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en) - [common configuration problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20337040/gmail-smtp-debug-error-please-log-in-via-your-web-browser)]
* [Mailchimp Transactional Emails](https://mailchimp.com/features/transactional-email/) [[settings](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/docs/fundamentals/)]
* [MailGun](https://mailgun.com/) [[settings](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-sending.html#send-with-smtp-or-api)]
* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) [[settings](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/mail/)]
* [Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com/) [[settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/how-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-microsoft-365-or-office-365)]

Many users of *Free Apps* use the settings of their own GMail account for convenience. There are many more email providers, most of which have SMTP compatibility.

Please note that you cannot send email from the Mendix Cloud over port 25. Although this port is open, it is heavily rate-limited by the infrastructure provider, so you will experience issues. This configuration cannot be changed.

Your SMTP provider needs to expose a secure port like 587, which is a best practice that most modern providers offer out of the box.

## 3 Sender and Recipient Address Requirements

* Always use a sender address which is an *existing address on which you are able to receive mail*. If you use a non-existent address as the sender address, you will not get (bounce) error messages which might be generated when mail delivery fails half way.

* Do not invent your own non-existing domain or local part

* Do not use noreply@ addresses unless that noreply@ address is a real email box from which you can read and process delivery errors.

* Sender or recipient addresses which contain a domain name that does not exist on the internet may be rejected by the outgoing mail server.

* Sender or recipient addresses which do not contain a domain name at all will be rejected by the outgoing mail server.

* Do not invent your own email addresses for testing purposes. Domain names like 'domain.com', 'email.com', 'test.com' are actually real domain names. Likely there's someone reading the mailbox for 'test@domain.com', who will receive email you send from your test environment if you send it there.
