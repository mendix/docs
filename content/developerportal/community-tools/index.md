## 1 Introduction

You can go to the [Mendix Community site](https://developers.mendix.com/) for all the information you need as a member of the Mendix community. Each section of the site represents a community tool that is continuously updated with new content and exciting developments. In addition, the content on the site is not only created for Mendix community developers, it is created by Mendix community developers.

The Mendix Community site includes the community tools described below.

## 2 Mendix Forum

On the [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com), you can ask questions and explore the knowledge offered by the entire Mendix community. There are questions and answers on various topics as well as a specific **Idea Forum** for the submission of unique ideas on changes and improvements to the Mendix app platform.

The **Forum** section at the top of the Mendix Community site presents the latest questions being asked on the Mendix Forum along with the author of the question and how long ago it was asked:
