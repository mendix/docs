## 1 Introduction

The [OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120371) module allows end-users of your Mendix app to login via Single Sign-on (SSO) using the OIDC protocol.  Besides delegating end-user authentication (OIDC), your app can also delegate authorization (OAuth).

OIDC is an extension of OAuth2 that propagates the end-user's identity to your application.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
This OIDC SSO module works with Mendix 9.0 and above. If you are using a previous version of Mendix, you can use the community-supported module [OpenIDConnect Single Sign-on (OIDC, OAuth2, SSO)](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117529).

If you are using Mendix 9.20 and above, please use version 2.0.0 or above of the OIDC SSO module.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The OIDC SSO module works with web/responsive applications only.

Alternatives to using OIDC SSO for managing single sign on are:

* [SAML](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1174) – if your IdP supports the SAML protocol but not the OIDC protocol
* [MendixSSO](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/111349) – if your app is targeted at end-users that have signed up to the Mendix platform

### 1.1 Typical Usage Scenarios

* **B2C apps:** Your app is aimed at consumers who have an identity at a 'social IdP' which uses OIDC, such as Google. In this case your app will only delegate the authentication to the IdP, no further user information is available to the app.
* **B2E app:** Your app is aimed at your company's employees and you want these employees to sign in to your app using corporate credentials hosted by your identity provider (IdP) that supports the OIDC protocol. In this case your app may have its own logic to assign user roles or you may use authorization information from your IdP as provided to your app using an access token.
* **API consumption.** If your app makes calls to APIs of other services on behalf of your end-user, you can use the access token obtained via the “OIDC SSO” module. This scenario is not supported when using SAML SSO. This makes the OIDC SSO module suitable for Mendix customers using Mendix Catalog.
* **Authorizing access to a Mendix back-end app.**  If you want to secure APIs in Mendix back-end apps using an access token, your API can use an access token passed by the calling app in the authorization header. If the access token is a JWT, your app can use the user and/or the user’s authorizations to assign user roles based on the claims in the access token JWT. 
* **Xcelerator apps.** Your Siemens Xcelerator app is designed to be integrated with Siemens' SAM IdP.  The Siemens SAM IdP supports the OIDC protocol and allows your app to delegate both authentication (login) and authorization (roles).

### 1.2 Features and Limitations

#### 1.2.1 Features

* Supports SSO login with one or multiple OIDC/OAuth-compatible IdPs.
* Easy configuration, by leveraging the so-called well-known discovery endpoint at your IdP.
    * For example, PKCE will be used automatically if it is detected.
* Configuration can be controlled through constants set during your deployment (version 2.3.0 and above). 
* Helper microflows (DELETE, GET, PATCH, POST, and PUT) which call an API with a valid token (and automate the token refresh process).
* Supports multiple OIDC IdPs by allowing configuration of user provisioning and access token parsing microflows per IdP.
* Supports Authentication Context Class Reference (ACR) to allow your app to suggest the desired method or level of authentication for user login to the Identity Provider (IDP) (version 2.3.0 and above). 
* Supports responsive web applications, a.k.a. browser based applications.
* Works with the Mendix DeepLink module.
* Built primarily in standard Mendix components (minimal Java) to allow for easy customization and ongoing development.

For readers with more knowledge of the OAuth and OIDC protocol.

* Uses the Authorization Code Grant flow to sign the end-user in via the browser.
* Uses the 'nonce' parameter to defend against replay attacks.
* Validates ID-token signatures.
* Uses the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE – pronounced “pixie") security enhancement as per RFC 7636. If your IdP’s well-known endpoint indicates “S256” as value for “code_challenge_methods_supported”, the OIDC Module will automatically apply the PKCE feature. PKCE can be seen as a security add-on to the original OAuth protocol. It is generally recommended to use this feature to be better protected against hackers who try to get access to your app.
* When authenticating APIs, it validates access tokens in one of two ways:

    * If the IdP supports token introspection, exposing the `/introspect` endpoint of the IdP, the OIDC module will introspect the access token to see if it is valid.
    * If the IdP does not support token introspection, the OIDC module will assume the access token is a JWT and will validate its signature using the IdP's public key that is published on the `/jwks` endpoint of the IdP.

    For signing into the app, the OIDC SSO module will not use token introspection and will always validate against the published jwks endpoint.

* Stores an access token for each end-user that can be used to make API calls on their behalf.
* Can be configured to use either client_secret_post or client_secret_basic as the client authentication method. Both make use of the client-id and client-secret as configured at the IdP.
* Supports ACR in authorization requests. The ACR in OIDC protocol is used to indicate the desired level of assurance or strength of authentication during the authentication process. It allows the relying party (your application) to request a specific level of authentication assurance from the identity provider (IdP) (version 2.3.0 and above).

#### 1.2.2 Limitations

The OIDC SSO module does not yet support the following:

* Requesting claims via the 'claims' query parameter, as per OIDC specs.
* Other client authentication methods such as using asymmetric keys (“private_key_jwt”).
* Delegating authorization using OAuth-scopes; this currently requires a custom microflow for parsing of Access Tokens.
* Mobile apps.
* PWA Apps.
* Controlling the configuration using constants requires an app restart.

The OIDC SSO module also has the following limitations:

* If an end-user accesses your app via a deeplink, the end-user is not already signed in, and you have configured multiple IdPs, only one IDP can be used to sign the end-user in.
* If you use both the [SAML](/appstore/modules/saml/) module and the OIDC SSO module in the same app, each end-user can only authenticate using one IdP.

## 2 Dependencies

The OIDC module requires your app to be using Mendix 8.18 or above.

It requires the following Marketplace modules to be included in your app:

* [Encryption](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1011) – see [Encryption](/appstore/modules/encryption/) documentation
* [Community Commons](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/170) – see [Community Commons](/appstore/modules/community-commons-function-library/) documentation
* [Nanoflow Commons](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/109515) – see [Nanoflow Commons](/appstore/modules/nanoflow-commons/) documentation
* [Mx Model reflection](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/69) – see [Mx Model Reflection](/appstore/modules/model-reflection/) documentation

Versions below 2.3.0 also require [Native Mobile Resources](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/109513) – see [Native Mobile Resources](/appstore/modules/native-mobile-resources/) documentation

## 3 Installation

If you are migrating from the community edition of the module ([OpenIDConnect Single Sign-on (OIDC, OAuth2, SSO)](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117529)), please refer to the [migration documentation](#migration) below.

1. [Add the “OIDC SSO” module into your app](/appstore/general/app-store-content/).
2. Add the necessary dependencies (as listed in the previous section) from the Marketplace, if they are not already included in your app.
3. Add the snippet **Snip_Configuration** in the **USE_ME** > **1. Configuration** folder of the OICD SSO module to a page that  is accessible to admin end-users of your app.
4. Replace all the layouts that end in `_REPLACEME` used in pages in this module with layouts from your own project. The layouts are in the **Implementation** > **Layouts** folder of the module. Use the [Find Usages](/refguide/find-and-find-advanced/#find-usages) command to find where they are used.
5. Follow the instructions in [OIDC App Configuration](#app-configuration) to set up your app.

### 3.1 Installing Mx Model Reflection{#mxmodelreflection}

Once the Mx Model Reflection module has been imported into your app, you need to configure it.

1. In the **App Explorer**, add the page **MxObjects_Overview** from the **MxModelReflection** folder to the Navigation menu.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/add-model-reflection.png" >}}

2. Run the app and click the newly-added navigation link to use Mx Model Reflection.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/model-reflection-button.png" >}}

3. Select the modules **MxModelReflection** and **OIDC**  and click **Click to refresh** for both the modules and the entities.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/refresh-model.png" >}}

### 3.2 Migrating from Community Edition to Platform Edition{#migration}

If you already have the [OpenIDConnect Single Sign-on (OIDC, OAuth2, SSO)](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117529) (community edition) in your module, you can migrate to this, platform supported, version by following the instruction below.

#### 3.2.1 Upgrading from Mendix 8 to Mendix 9

To migrate from Mendix 8.18.x to Mendix 9.8.1 or above, follow the steps below:

1. Open your app in the latest patch version of Mendix 8.18 and allow it to be upgraded.
2. Save the upgraded version of the app.
3. Review the guidance in [Moving from Mendix Studio Pro 8 to 9](/refguide9/moving-from-8-to-9/).
4. Open your app in Mendix 9.8.1 or above and allow it to be upgraded.
5. Import the “OIDC SSO” Platform Edition module from the Marketplace.
6. Import the “Mx Model Reflection” module from Marketplace.
7. In the dialog **Security** > **User roles**, select *Administrator* and click **Edit**.
8. Enable `MxModelReflection.ModelAdministrator` and close the dialog boxes with the **OK** button.
9. You can see some errors in the Errors tab. To resolve these errors, import the “Atlas Core” module from the Marketplace.
10. If you still have errors, review the information in [Migrate From Atlas 2 To Atlas 3](/refguide9/moving-from-atlas-2-to-3/) and use it to resolve the issues.
11. Delete the “Atlas_UI_Resources” module from your app. Your app is now using themes from the Atlas Core Module.
12. Update the “Administration” and “MendixSSO” modules to the latest version by importing them from the Marketplace.

#### 3.2.2 Replacing Community Edition with Platform Edition on Mendix 9

If your app is already developed using Mendix 9 or above, but uses the community edition of the OIDC SSO module, you can just do the following.

1. Import the "OIDC" platform edition module from the Marketplace.
2. Import the "Mx Model Reflection" Module from the Marketplace.

## 4 OIDC App Configuration{#app-configuration}

This section shows you how to configure your app to use OIDC for SSO.

### 4.1 Configuring Roles

Ensure that you have allocated the following user roles to the OIDC module roles:

| User Role | OIDC Module Role |
| --- | --- |
| Administrator | OIDC.Administrator |
| Anonymous | OIDC.Anonymous |
| User | OIDC.User |

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/user-roles.png" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You may have to add the *Anonymous* user role if it does not exist already.
{{% /alert %}}

### 4.2 Allowing Anonymous Users

The OIDC module supports multiple OIDC/OAuth-compatible IdPs. To allow your end-users to choose from a number of different IdPs, or to have the option to log back into the app after they have logged out, you will need to give them access to the app before they have signed in to the app. Therefore, you need to give anonymous users access to your app.

In the **Anonymous** tab of the app security settings, do the following:

1. Set **Allow anonymous users** to **Yes**
2. Select *Anonymous* as the **Anonymous user role**

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/anonymous-user.png" >}}

### 4.3 Configuring Navigation

The OIDC SSO module works without a specified sign-in page. Therefore, in the navigation section of your app, set **Sign-in page** (in the **Authentication** section) to *(none)*.

To allow your end-users to choose from a number of different IdPs, or to have the option to log back into the app after they have logged out, set a **Role-based home page** for role **Anonymous** to **OIDC.Login_Web_Button**. See [Role-Based Home Pages](/refguide/navigation/#role-based) in *Navigation* for more information.

In addition, administrators will need to have access to configure OIDC and also manage end-users. You can do this by including the pages `Administration.Account_Overview` and `OIDC.OIDC_Client_Overview` into the app navigation, or a separate administration page.

### 4.4 Setting Encryption Key

Follow the instructions to [set an encryption key in the Encryption module](/appstore/modules/encryption/#configuration). The constant to set is called `Encryption.EncryptionKey` and should be a random value 32 characters long. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt values.

## 5 Configuration of OIDC Provider{#oidc-configuration}

### 5.1 OIDC Provider Configuration

#### 5.1.1 General OIDC Providers

1. In your IdP, provision a new OpenID client application. You will receive a ClientID and Client Secret.
2. You will also need the OIDC configuration endpoint (for example: [https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration))
3. Register the following callback URLs:
    * `https://<your-app-url>/oauth/v2/callback`
    * `makeitnative://<your-app-url>/oauth/callback`

#### 5.1.2 Microsoft Azure AD Provider Configuration for APIs{#azure-portal}

This section gives some guidance for doing the necessary configurations at your Azure AD provider to obtain access tokens containing the right authorization claims to secure your APIs.

If you don’t set the access token up correctly, you will get access tokens containing default `aud` (audience) claims. The default audience is the Microsoft Graph API and so these access tokens cannot be validated by your API.

To get the Microsoft Identity Platform to issue access tokens you can pass to your API, you need to set up a custom scope in the App Registration’s **Expose an API** tab, and request that scope when you acquire the tokens. TO do this:

1. Open the **Expose an API** tab in the **App Registration** page of the Azure Portal.
1. In the **Expose an API** tab, set up a custom scope.
    The scope will be prefixed with your `Application ID URI`.
1. In the **API permissions** tab, assign the created scope to the application.
1. In the **App roles** tab, add the user roles you want to authorize using either the user role name, or the user role UUID. This adds the configured user roles to the roles claim in the access token. 

By adding a custom claim to the App Registration’s Expose an API tab and requesting that scope when we acquire tokens, the Microsoft Identity Platform will now generate access tokens that can be validated using the `/jwks` URI.

#### 5.1.3 Amazon Cognito Provider Configuration

To configure Amazon Cognito for the OIDC SSO module, follow these steps:

1. Optional: If you are using the AWS test environment with Amazon Cognito set as the user pool, you must verify the email addresses by doing the following steps:
    1. In Amazon SES, click **Configuration** > **Verified identities**.
    2. On the **Verified identities** page, in the **Identities** section, click **Create identity**.
    3. Verify the email address or addresses that you want to use for the user pool

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-cognito/verifyemail.png" alt="The Verified identities page in Amazon SES">}}

2. Create a user pool for Amazon Cognito by doing the following steps:
    1. In the Amazon Console, open the Amazon Cognito service.
    2. Select the region where you want to create the user pool, and then click **Create user pool**.
    3. Follow the **Create user pool** wizard to configure the sign-in and sign-up, security requirements, and message delivery.
    4. In the **Integrate your app** step of the wizard, enter a name for your user pool and leave the other settings as default.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-cognito/userpoolname.png" alt="The Integrate your app step in the Create user pool wizard">}}
    
    5. Review and create the user pool.

3. Add users to the user pool by doing the following steps:
    1. In Amazon Cognito, on the **User pools** page, find and open the user pool that you created.
    2. On the **Users** tab of the user pool, click **Create user**.
    3. Specify a verified email and a password.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-cognito/addusers.png" alt="The Users tab of a user pool">}}

4. Configure the app integration by doing the following steps:
    1. Go to the **App integration** tab of the user pool that you created.
    2. In the **App clients and analytics** section, click **Create app client**.
    
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-cognito/createappclient.png" alt="The Create app client button on the App integration page">}}

    3. On the **Create app client** page, configure the following settings:
        * **App type** - **Public client**
        * **App client name** - Enter a descriptive app client name
        * **Client secret** - Select **Generate a client secret**
        * **Authentication flows** - Select **ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH**
        * **Authentication flow session duration** - Enter a value from *3* to *15*
        * **Allowed callback URLs** - Enter a URL in the following format: `https://{your Mendix app URL}]/oauth/v2/callback`
        * **Allowed sign-out URLs** - This setting is optional, and you may leave it blank
        * **Identity providers** - Select **Cognito user pool**
        * **OAuth 2.0 grant types** - Select **Authorization code grant**
    4. Save your changes.
    5. Open the app client that you created.
    6. In the **App client information** section, copy the **Client ID** and the **Client secret**, and save them in a secure location.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-cognito/idsecret.png" alt="The Client ID and Client secret on the App client information page">}}

    7. Go back to the user pool that you created.
    8. On the **App integration** tab, in the **Domain** section, copy the **Cognito domain** and save it in a secure location.

### 5.2 OIDC Client Configuration{#client-configuration}

You can configure your OIDC client using the app pages – see [General OIDC Clients](#general-oidc), [Microsoft Azure AD Client Configuration](#azure), and [Amazon Cognito Client Configuration](#cognito), below. In version 2.3.0 and above, you can also use constants to configure your app at deployment time – see [Automated Deploy-time SSO Configuration](#deploy-time), below.

#### 5.2.1 General OIDC Clients {#general-oidc}

In this case, the OIDC client is the app you are making.

1. Start your app, log in as an administrator, for example *demo_administrator*, and access the OpenID Setup page.
1. Add a new client configuration and give it an **Alias** so you can identify it if you have more than one client configuration.
1. Add the **Client ID**.

   **Client assertion** is automatically set to *Client ID and Secret*.
   
1. Choose the **Client authentication method** — make sure that you select a method that is supported by your IdP. You can normally check this via the `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` setting on the IdP’s well-known endpoint. Also ensure that the correct client authentication method is configured at the IdP when you register the client.

    The options are:
    * client_secret_basic: Your app will use the HTTP Basic Authentication scheme to authenticate itself at your IdP. (Default – for security reasons this should be your preferred choice)
    * client_secret_post: Your app will authenticate itself by including its client_id and client_secret in the payload of token requests. (Older versions of the OIDC SSO module used this method).
    
1. Add the **Client Secret**.
1. If you have the **Automatic Configuration URL** (also known as the *well-known endpoint*), enter it and click **Import Configuration** to automatically fill the other endpoints.
    * If you don't have an automatic configuration URL, you can fill in the other endpoints manually.
1. Click **Save**
    {{% alert color="info" %}}Your client configuration is not yet complete, but you have to save at this point to allow you to set up the rest of the information.{{% /alert %}}
1. Select your client configuration and click **Edit**.
1. Select the scopes expected by your OIDC IdP. The standard scopes are `openid`, `profile`, and `email`, but some IdPs may use different ones.
    * If you need refresh tokens for your end-users, you also need the `offline` scope.
    * Add other scopes as needed.
1. Select your user provisioning flow. By default, this module will use standard OpenID claims to provision end-users in your app. Also included is a flow that uses the standard UserInfo endpoint in OIDC, which is useful in the case that your IdP uses "thin tokens". Also included is a salesforce-specific example. You may need to make changes in order to implement provisioning logic which fits your business needs. To do so, read the section on [Custom User Provisioning](#custom-provisioning).
1. Optionally, check **Enable Access Token Parsing** if you want to use additional information from the OIDC IdP. This can be used, for example, to assign end-user roles based on information from the IdP – see [Access Token Parsing](#access-token-parsing) for more information.

Once you have completed these steps, the SSO-configuration is ready for testing. See the section on [Testing and troubleshooting](#testing) for more information.

See the section [Optional Features](#optional) information on additional optional features you may want to implement.

#### 5.2.2 Microsoft Azure AD Client Configuration for APIs {#azure}

For Azure AD access to APIs through an access token, in addition to the configuration described above, we can request the scope [configured in Azure portal](#azure-portal), described above, from the OIDC SSO UI configuration.

1. Start your app, log in as an administrator, for example *demo_administrator*, and access the OpenID Setup page.
1. Add the custom scope which you [configured in Azure](#azure-portal) in **Available scopes**.
1. Save the configuration.
1. Edit the Azure AD configuration and add the custom scope to **Selected scopes**.

Now, you can acquire tokens which can be validated using JWKS URI.

#### 5.2.3 Amazon Cognito Client Configuration {#cognito}

After you configure the necessary settings in Amazon Cognito, you must add the endpoint URLs to your Mendix app, and then add a button to sign in with Amazon Cognito.

1. In your Mendix app, configure a new OIDC client, as described in [OIDC SSO: OIDC Client Configuration](/appstore/modules/oidc/#client-configuration). Make sure to configure the following settings:
    * **Alias** - Enter a descriptive name to identify your app
    * **Client ID** - Enter the app client ID that you obtained from the user pool in Amazon Cognito
    * **Client secret** - Enter the client secret that you obtained from the user pool in Amazon Cognito
    * **Client authentication method** - Select **client_secret_post**
    * **Automatic Configuration URL** - Enter a URL in the following format: `https://cognito-idp.{the region where you created the user pool}.amazonaws.com/{your user pool ID}/.well-known/openid-configuration`
    
    For more information, see [User pool OIDC and hosted UI API endpoints reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html).

2. Click **Import Configuration** to automatically fill the other endpoints.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-cognito/filledendpoints.png" alt="Sample endpoint URLs">}}

3. Click **Save**.
4. Add an Amazon Cognito sign in button to a page in your app.
    
    You can achieve this by adding the **ACT_StartWebSignIn_Default** nanoflow to the button. For more information about creating custom buttons, see [Creating a Custom Save Button with a Microflow](/refguide/creating-a-custom-save-button/).

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-cognito/samplelogin.png" alt="Sample endpoint URLs">}}

Users who are part of the user pool you created in Amazon Cognito can now log in with their Amazon Cognito user name and password.

#### 5.2.4 Automated Deploy-time SSO Configuration{#deploy-time}

In version 2.3.0 and above, you can configure the OIDC SSO module using app [constants](/refguide/constants/) rather than using the app's administration pages. As the developer of an app using OIDC SSO, you can set default values. These values can be overridden using the app’s constants.

To enable the use of app constants to configure the OIDC SSO module, configure your app to run the Startup microflow in the OIDC module (OIDC.Startup) as (part of) the [after startup](/refguide/app-settings/#after-startup) microflow.

Use the following security best-practices when setting up your constants:

* Set the [Export level](/refguide/configure-add-on-and-solution-modules/#export-level) for these constants to `Hidden` for security reasons.
* Mask your client_secret so the value is not visible in the developer portal – [constants](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#constants) in the *Environment Details* documentation for more information.

The configuration you set through constants will mirror the configuration described in [General OIDC Clients](#general-oidc), above.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
SSO configurations created using constants will be shown as read only on the OpenID Setup page in the app.

The following error messages will be displayed when you try to edit/delete.

* error at edit:  You cannot modify as it is created from deployment.
* error at delete:  You cannot delete as it is created from deployment.
{{% /alert %}}

The following constants are mandatory when creating an OIDC SSO configuration

* **ClientID** – the client id
* **ClientAlias** – the client alias
* **ClientSecret** – the client secret (see security best-practice, above)
* **AutomaticConfigurationURL** – the URL of the well-known endpoint 

The following constants are optional:

* **ClientAuthenticationMethod** (*default: client_secret_basic*) – the client authentication method — the caption of OIDC.ENU_ClientAuthenticationMethod

    Examples: `client_secret_post` or `client_secret_basic`

* **CallbackResponseMode** (*default: Query*) – : the callback response mode — the caption of OIDC.ENU_ResponseMode

    Example: `Query`

* **CustomATP**: a custom access token processing microflow — the value of `CompleteName` in the mxmodelreflection$microflows table

    Example: `OIDC.Default_PIB_TokenProcessing_CustomATP`

* **CustomCallbackURL** – the custom callback URL

* **SelectedClaim** – selected claim values — multiple values can be separated by a space

    Example: `auth_time created_at`

* **SelectedScope** – selected scopes — multiple values can be separated by a space

    Example: `openid profile email`

* **UserProvisioningFlow** (*default: Standard OIDC*) – the custom user provisioning — the `caption` of OIDC.ENU_UserProvisioningFlows

    Example: `Standard OIDC`

* **SessionEndPoint** – the end session endpoint

* **ACRValues** – selected ACRvalues — the selected scopes with multiple values separated by a space  

    Example: `acr1 acr2`

## 6 User Provisioning

Initially your app will not have any end-users. The OIDC module provides so-called Just-In-Time (JIT) user provisioning. This means that an end-user will be created in your app (as an `Account` object in the Administration module) when they log in for the first time.
The user provisioning works by default but you can customize it if needed.

### 6.1 Default User Provisioning

By default, the `CUSTOM_UserProvisioning` microflow in the **USE_ME** > **1. Configuration** folder of the OIDC module uses the `UserProvisioning_StandardOIDC` microflow. This applies the following mapping:

| ID-token Provided by your IdP | Attribute of `Administration.Account` Object |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| sub                           | Name                          |
| name                          | Fullname                      |
| email                         | Email                         |

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Do not change the `UserProvisioning_StandardOIDC` microflow. This may give problems if you upgrade to a newer version of the OIDC SSO module. Apply customizations to the `CUSTOM_UserProvisioning` microflow only.

### 6.2 Custom User Provisioning{#custom-provisioning}

Review the microflow `CUSTOM_UserProvisioning` in the **USE_ME** > **1. Configuration** folder of the OIDC module. This is where you can change the way that end-users are provisioned in your app. The OpenID token is passed to the microflow as a parameter. Use this object to find an existing, or create a new, `Administration.Account` object for the end-user. This is set as the return value of the microflow. You can find examples included in the **USE_ME** > **1. Configuration** > **User Provisioning Examples** folder.

Make a single call from `CUSTOM_UserProvisioning` to your own module where you implement the provisioning flow you need. This way, it will be easy to install new versions of the OIDC SSO module over time without overwriting your custom provisioning.

The OIDC SSO module supports multiple IdPs. Since each provider can provide user data in a different format, you may want to use multiple provisioning flows. See the microflow `UserProvisioning_Sample` for an example and details on how to do this.

## 7 API Authentication {#api-authentication}

You can create your own APIs within your Mendix app and secure the end point over OIDC using a custom authentication microflow. To do this:

1. Create a REST API endpoint which needs to be secured.
2. Use **Custom** as the [authentication method](/refguide/published-rest-service/#authentication) to secure the endpoint with an access token.
3. Select the `OIDC.APIAuthentication` microflow which has `HTTPRequest` as the input and returns `System.User` as the output.

## 8 Optional Features{#optional}

### 8.1 Performing API Calls on Behalf of an Authenticated User

You might want to make API calls to other apps/services on behalf of the end-user. As you have used the OIDC module to authenticate the end-user to your app, your app also has an access token for this end-user. 

If the API supports OAuth and/or OIDC, you can use this access token to propagate the end-user's identity to the API so the API does not need to have a user identifier in the payload. To do this, the API needs to:

* accept OAuth bearer tokens in the HTTP `Authorization` request header field, as per [section 7 of RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-7)
* accept Access Tokens from the same IdP where your user was authenticated
* parse the Access Token as JWT (as suggested by [RFC 9068](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068) – although your Access Tokens do not necessarily have to be fully compliant with that RFC) or be able to invoke the UserInfo endpoint (as suggested by the [OIDC specs](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo))

Access tokens have a short lifespan for security reasons, so you need to ensure that it has not expired. If the access token has expired, you can retrieve a new one using the refresh token that was acquired together with the access token.

The OIDC SSO module contains microflows that do this for you. These microflows all make use of the `OIDC.Token` object that contains both the Access Token (from OAuth protocol) and the ID-token (from the OIDC specs).

You can find the following microflows in the **USE_ME** > **3. Make Authorized API Calls** folder of the OIDC module.

#### 8.1.1 DELETE

Takes as input:

* **Location:** – a string containing the URL you want to do the DELETE on
* **Request:**  – a string containing the content of the DELETE request (most likely a formatted JSON)
* **Token:**  – the `OIDC.Token` object that should be used for authentication, typically retrieved via the `Token_Account` association (to find the token of the current user/session)

The microflow returns an object of type `System.HttpResponse`. This could indicate an error.

#### 8.1.2 GET

Takes as input:

* **Request:**  – a string containing the URL you want to GET data from
* **Token:**  – the `OIDC.Token` object that should be used for authentication, typically retrieved via the `Token_Account` association (to find the token of the current user/session)

The microflow returns an object of type `System.HttpResponse`. This could indicate an error.

#### 8.1.3 PATCH

Takes as input:

* **Location:** – a string containing the URL you want to do the PATCH on
* **Request:**  – a string containing the content of the PATCH request (most likely a formatted JSON)
* **Token:**  – the `OIDC.Token` object that should be used for authentication, typically retrieved via the `Token_Account` association (to find the token of the current user/session)

The microflow returns an object of type `System.HttpResponse`. This could indicate an error.

#### 8.1.4 POST

Takes as input:

* **Location:** – a string containing the URL you want to do the POST on
* **Request:**  – a string containing the content of the POST request (most likely a formatted JSON)
* **Token:**  – the `OIDC.Token` object that should be used for authentication, typically retrieved via the `Token_Account` association (to find the token of the current user/session)

The microflow returns an object of type `System.HttpResponse`. This could indicate an error.

#### 8.1.5 PUT

Takes as input:

* **Location:** – a string containing the URL you want to do the PUT on
* **Request:**  – a string containing the content of the PUT request (most likely a formatted JSON)
* **Token:**  – the `OIDC.Token` object that should be used for authentication, typically retrieved via the `Token_Account` association (to find the token of the current user/session)

The microflow returns an object of type `System.HttpResponse`. This could indicate an error.

### 8.2 Access Token Parsing{#access-token-parsing}

With the OAuth/OIDC protocol, access tokens can be opaque or can be a JSON Web Token (JWT).
If you are just delegating authentication for your app to the IdP you will not need to know the contents of the access token.

If you want to use the information in an access token which is a JWT, you need to parse the access token in a microflow. For example, you may want to assign user roles in your app based on the contents of the access token JWT.

* The OIDC module provides you with default microflows for parsing access tokens from the following IdPs:
    * Siemens SAM – in this case the `sws.samauth.role.name` claim is interpreted — for example:

        ```json {linenos=false}
        "sws.samauth.role.name": [
        "c1c31b36-2779-4ddd-a6e7-eaff22ad382c"
        ]
        ```

    * Microsoft Azure AD – in this case the `roles` claim is interpreted, using the roles claim in the access token — for example:

        ```json {linenos=false}
        "roles": [
        "c1c31b36-2779-4ddd-a6e7-eaff22ad382c"
        ]
        ```

* If you are using another IdP or want to use a different claim, you can create a custom microflow to parse the access token.

To parse access tokens, you need to do the following:

1. Create a secure REST API endpoint following the instructions in [API Authentication](#api-authentication), above.
1. Run your app and sign in as an administrator, for example `Demo_administrator`.
1. Configure the client information in the OIDC Client configuration screen.
1. Check **Enable Access Token Parsing** to parse access tokens when performing [OIDC Client Configuration](#client-configuration).
1. Select the appropriate microflow to parse the access token as described in the relevant section below. If you have added a new microflow, you will need to refresh the module containing your microflow as described in [Installing Mx Model Reflection](#mxmodelreflection).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In version 2.0.0 and above of the OIDC SSO module you will also find a microflow for parsing PIB tokens. This feature will be released publicly in the future and documented at that time. 
{{% /alert %}}

#### 8.2.1 Parsing SAM Access Tokens

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This section is only relevant if you are a Mendix partner and you want to integrate your app with the Siemens SAM IdP.
{{% /alert %}}

To parse of SAM access tokens you need to do the following when performing [OIDC Client Configuration](#client-configuration):

1. Select *OIDC.Default_SAM_TokenProcessing_CustomATP* as the **custom AccessToken processing microflow**.
    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/enable-sam-parsing.png" >}}
1. Add the scopes `sam_account`, `samauth.role`, `samauth.tier`, and `samauth.ten` to the **Selected Scopes** in the OIDC Client Configuration.
1. Configure the user roles in your app to match the roles returned by SAM. End-users will be given the matching role when they sign into the app. If the role in the SAM token is not found in the Mendix app the end-user will be given the role `User`.
1. Save the configuration.

#### 8.2.2 Parsing Microsoft Azure AD Access Tokens

The OIDC SSO module provides a default access token parsing microflow for Azure AD. To use it, select the appropriate access token parsing microflow:

* For Azure AD, the default access token parsing microflow is `OIDC.Default_Azure_TokenProcessing_CustomATP`.

To confirm that the authorization is working, get an access token from your Azure AD IdP and pass it to the API Endpoint using the authorization header.

#### 8.2.3 Parsing OIDC Provider Access Tokens

The OIDC SSO module version 2.3.0 and above provides a default access token parsing microflow to use when you are authenticating using the OIDC Provider module as your IdP.

To parse the OIDC Provider access tokens you need to do the following when performing OIDC Client Configuration: 

1. Select `OIDC.Default_OIDCProvider_TokenProcessing_CustomATP` as the **custom AccessToken processing microflow**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/enable-oidc-provider-parsing.png" >}}

2. Add the scopes `openid` and the ModelGUID or Name to the **Selected Scopes** in the OIDC Client Configuration. The ModelGUID will look something like `53f5d6fa-6da9-4a71-b011-454ec052cce8`.

    If any one of the selected scopes of OIDC SSO matches with OIDC Provider Scopes then the user role is created. If you specify extra scopes those scopes are ignored.
    
3. Make sure that the app acting as OIDC Provider returns the right user roles for the end-users of your app. End-users will be given the matching role when they sign into the app. If the role in the OIDC Provider token is not found in the Mendix app the end-user will be given the user role `User`, but will not be given access to application.
   
4. Save the configuration. 
    
To confirm that the authorization is working, get an access token from your OIDC Provider IdP and pass it to the API Endpoint using the authorization header. 

#### 8.2.4 Parsing Access Tokens Using a Custom Microflow{#custom-parsing}

If you choose to implement your own microflow to parse an access token, the microflow name must contain `CustomATP`, for example `CustomATP_MyTokenParser`. This is how you can parse access tokens issued by IdPs such as Microsoft Azure AD.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you are using Microsoft Azure AD, ensure you have followed the instructions for getting valid tokens in [Configuration of OIDC Provider](#oidc-configuration), above.
{{% /alert %}}

You can find a sample microflow for parsing access tokens, `OIDC.ACT_Token_CustomATPRetrieveRoles` in the OIDC module.

Your custom microflow should use the access token to create a list of user roles. Your token will contain one of the following:

* the UUIDs of the user roles in your app which map to the `System.UserRole/ModelGUID` attribute
* the name of the user role in the app, which can be used to find the `System.UserRole` within the app itself using the `Name` attribute

For version 2.0.0 and above of the OIDC SSO module, your custom microflow takes the access token as the parameter. Use this access token to determine the roles the user has within your app when signed in using the OIDC module. These should be returned as a list of objects of type `OIDC.Role`.

For versions of the OIDC SSO module below 2.0.0, the process is a bit more complicated. The custom microflow has an `Administration.Account` object as the parameter and must do the following:

1. Retrieve the access token of the account.
1. Use the access token to determine the roles the user has within your app when signed in using the OIDC module.
1. Convert these roles to a list of objects containing the user role.
1. Return a list of objects of type `System.UserRole`.
1. Invoke the `BCO_Account_ProcessRolesToken` in the **SAM** folder of the OIDC module to associate the current user with the correct user roles in your app.

For all versions of the OIDC SSO module, once you have created the microflow (for example `CustomATP_xxx`), you must do the following:

1. Refresh the module containing your microflow as described in [Installing Mx Model Reflection](#mxmodelreflection).
1. Select your microflow (for example, *CustomATP_xxx*) as the **custom AccessToken processing microflow**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If your microflow is not correctly implemented you will be told that **Authentication failed!** and will see errors in the log under the OIDC log node.
{{% /alert %}}

### 8.3 Deep Links

To use this module in conjunction with the DeepLink module, you'll need to set the `LoginLocation` constant of the DeepLink module to '/oauth/v2/login?cont='

If end-users that use the deeplink do not yet have a session in your app, the deeplink can trigger the SSO process. If that is successful, the end-user will automatically be redirected back to the deeplink.

The DeepLink module does not have full support for multiple IDPs, so it can only trigger logins at one IDP. If you do not specify which IdP you want the DeepLink module to use, it will use the default IdP.

You can also specify which IdP should be used by adding the alias (`MyIdPAlias`) to the `LoginLocation`: `/oauth/v2/login?idp={MyIdpAlias}&cont=`. For example, `/oauth/v2/login?idp=Google&cont=`. This setting will apply to all deeplinks in your app.

To use OIDC SSO module in conjunction with the DeepLink module, you can choose between the following methods of selecting an IDP:

### 8.4 Logging Out

A standard logout action will end an end-user's Mendix session, but will not end their SSO session. To perform an SSO logout, also known as Single Log Out (SLO), use the nanoflow `ACT_Logout`, which will redirect your user to the IdP's “end session endpoint” if configured.

To do this, add a menu item or button for your end-users that calls the nanoflow `ACT_Logout`.

### 8.5 Use ACR to Request Authentication Method

By default, the OIDC SSO module does not care how users are signed in at your IDP, that is left to the discretion of the IDP. In some cases your IDP may support different methods for end-users to be authenticated and your app may want to indicate a preference.

The following sections describe the steps needed to make use of the ACR mechanism.

ACR is available in version 2.3.0 and above of the OIDC SSO module.

#### 8.5.1 Configuring Authentication Methods That Can Be Requested at Your IDP

To configure the ACR value(s) in the OIDC SSO module, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to the screen where the OIDC configuration is managed. 
2. Select your client configuration and click **Edit**.
3. Add the ACR values that are supported by your IDP to the OIDC Client Configuration.

    For example, supported ACR Values for Okta IdP are: `urn:okta:loa:1fa:any` and `urn:okta:loa:2fa:any`.
 
4. Save the configuration changes. 

#### 8.5.2 Selecting the ACR Value During Sign In

When you have configured multiple ACR values for your IDP, the OIDC module shows the ACR values as additional ways to sign in on the default login page.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/login-acr-options.png" >}}

#### 8.5.3 Customizing the Login Page

If you want to customize this login page for your end-users, perform the following steps:

1. Create a new [page](/refguide/page/).
1. Open the App Navigation and set the newly created login page as the [Default home page](/refguide/setting-up-the-navigation-structure/#home).
1. Create [Role-based home pages](/refguide/setting-up-the-navigation-structure/#role-based-home-page) for the user roles. Set the newly created login page as the target home page.
1. In the **Authentication** section, set the new login page as the **Sign-in page**.

Depending on how your login-page works and/or which login-option is selected by the end-user, the OIDC SSO module will select the corresponding ACR value in the `acr_values` request parameter.

#### 8.5.4 ID-token Processing

Your IDP may have different ways of handling requests to use a specific authentication method. The OpenID Connect protocol allows for different kinds of logic at your IDP. A few options are:

* Your IDP may always ensure users are authenticated as requested
* Your IDP may honor what is requested on a ‘best effort’ basis and indicate the actual authentication method used in the ID-token that is sent to your app.
* Your IDP may send an error response to your app if the requested authentication method was not possible for the user that was asked to login, for whatever reason.

When a user successfully signs in at your IDP, your IDP may or may not return an ACR claim in the ID-token. If your IDP returns the actual authentication method that was used in the ACR claim in the ID-token (and/or Access Token), you can create a [custom User Provisioning microflow](#custom-provisioning) (or [custom access token parsing microflow](#custom-parsing)) to grant or restrict access to specific resources or functionalities based on the level of authentication assurance.

## 9 Testing and Troubleshooting{#testing}

Once you have your app deployed, you can test the SSO set-up by trying to login. If you have multiple IdPs setup, you will be able to choose which IdP to use for authentication. If you have only one IdP provider configured, then you will be taken directly to that IdP's sign in page.

The OIDC SSO module uses two endpoints at your IdP to achieve the SSO. You may get errors from either of these endpoints.

When testing, you can use Postman (or any client application) to check the responses from the various endpoints.

### 9.1 /authorize

The `/authorize` endpoint logs the end-user in through the browser.

The `/authorize` endpoint may reply with an error-response, for example when the end-user enters a wrong password but also other situations may occur.  The `Error` level response can be retrieved from the OIDC log node.

```log
handleAuthorization: Authorization code missing 
StatusCode = 200 
error = access_denied 
error_description = user is not assigned to the client application. 
```

Section 4.1.2.1 of [RFC6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and section 3.1.2.6 of [OIDC specifications](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthError), indicate all error codes that may be returned.

### 9.2 /token

The `/token` endpoint is a back-end call to get an access token.

The error “Unable to get access token” indicates that the OAuth **/token** endpoint at your IdP has returned an error response. Often this error occurs when your client_id and client_secret are not correct. The `Error` level response can be retrieved from the OIDC log node.

```log 
401: Unauthorized 
    at OIDC.handleAuthorizationCode (CallRest : 'Call REST (POST)') 
    at OIDC.webCallback (SubMicroflow : 'handleAuthorizationCode') 
Advanced stacktrace: 
    at com.mendix.integration.actions.microflow.RestCaIIAction.execute(RestCaIIAction.scala : 79)

latestHttpResponse: 
StatusCode - 401 
ReasonPhrase - Unauthorized 
Content - {"error":"invalid_client","error_description":"client authentication failed"} 
```

[Section 5.2 of RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.2) indicates and clarifies all the possible error codes that may be returned.

### 9.3 Custom Microflow Implementation Should Be Required to Process Access_Token Roles

If you get the error message “Custom microflow implementation should be required to process Access_token roles” in the Mendix Studio Pro console logs, this indicates you have not completely implemented your custom microflow for parsing access tokens (`CustomATP_…`). See the section on [Access Token Parsing](#access-token-parsing).

### 9.4 End-Users of App Deployed On Premises Do Not Return to the App After Sign In

If you have deployed your app on premises but did not configure a return URL for your app properly, the end-users of your app are redirected to your IDP for login, but will not be redirected back to your app.

To resolve this, open the Mendix Service Console and ensure that the **Port number** for the **Public application root URL**, **Runtime server port**, and **Admin server port** match.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/oidc/service-console-ports.png" >}}
