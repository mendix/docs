## 2 Checking Useful Links Before Submitting a Request

Before submitting a new Menix Support request, check these resources to make sure your question has not already been answered:

* [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendix.com)
* [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/)
* [Mendix Platform status](https://status.mendix.com)

If you cannot find the answer to your question on the Mendix Forum or in the Mendix documentation, you can submit a support request. The Mendix Support Portal will walk you through the ticket creation by asking for relevant information based on the type of request. 

## 3 Submitting a New Request

You can access the Mendix Support Portal at [support.mendix.com](https://support.mendix.com).

This is the basic information required for a ticket:

* A description of the desired goal (optional)
* The affected app (for more information, see [How to Prepare Your App Project for Support](prepare-your-project))

To submit a request with Mendix Support, follow these steps:

1. Click **Submit a request** in the top-right corner of the portal.

If investigating the documentation and searching the [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com/index4.html) does not help you solve your issue, you can submit the Mendix Support request.
