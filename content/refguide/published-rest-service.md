The **published REST service** feature was introduced in version 7.10.0.

{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

Use a published REST service to expose your entities and microflows to other apps using the REST standard.

## 2 General

### <a name="service-name"></a>2.1 Service Name

The service name uniquely identifies the service in the app. It's part of the location of the service, so it cannot contain spaces or special characters.

### 2.2 Example Location

The example location shows the URL on which the service can be reached. This is an example: 

![](attachments/published-rest-service/example-location-url.png)

### <a name="public-documentation"></a>2.3 Public Documentation

The public documentation is used in the service's [OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) Documentation](open-api). You can use [GitHub-flavored markdown](gfm-syntax) for rich text.

### <a name="export-swagger-json"></a>2.4 Export swagger.json

Click **Export swagger.json** to save the service's [OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation](open-api) somewhere on your machine. This is a machine-readable file in the [OpenAPI 2.0 file format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). Most API tools support this format.

When the app is running, this file is available under `/rest-doc/servicename/swagger.json`.

## 3 Security

### <a name="authentication"></a>3.1 Authentication

{{% alert type="info" %}}

The **Authentication** feature was introduced in version 7.11.0. In earlier versions, it was always **Username and password**.

{{% /alert %}}

Select whether clients need to authenticate with a username and a password (using basic authentication) or not.

### 3.2 Allowed Roles

The allowed roles define which [module role](module-role) a user must have to be able to access the service. This option is only available when **Authentication** is set to **Username and password**.

## 4 Resources

A REST service exposes a number of [resources](published-rest-resource). On a resource you can define GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations.

## 5 Operations

When you select a resource, you see the [operations](published-rest-operation) that are defined for that resource.
