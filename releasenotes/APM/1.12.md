This is a release with customer-requested features and bug fixes.

## Import and export of settings

There was a customer request to share settings between apps and environments. This is now possible with the new import/export. From the global settings dialog you can export all settings at once and import them on another environment. 

Also on installation a file can be imported if a customer wants it's own settings on install.

## Recreate sample data
If no sample data was selected on install, users might want to do this afterwards. This function renames conflicting items, so if a customized version of sample data is in the system you can safely add an extra copy.

## Set production / non-production globally
Customers wanted 1 button to configure the entire system to production or non-production settings.


## Other Fixes/Improvements

* On environments with a smaller amount of memory the upgrade function that would change all statistics, measurements or traps would run out of memory. This data is now committed in chunks, so those environments can upgrade.
* The upgrade function to place old statistics in a snapshot failed and is now works correctly
* You could start the performance tool again if the performance tool was stopped, but in the background the database profiler for the SQL statements was still running. This has been fixed.
* Duration column headers now mention (ms) as the unit.
* The license server now handles enterprise licenses without manual intervention as well
* Extra help has been added to some trigger pattern fields with a description and a link to java regex sites.
* The fixed duration function has been removed from the trap and the statistics tool. These options were never used and do not fit into the modules.
* The statistics tool running microflows tab now has an auto-refresh option that can be turned on or off.
* Some JSON messages sometimes appeared in the log because other modules (REST mappings) would use the same log node. These have been filtered out. Also on Mendix 7 Mendix changed the client-API for the keepalive not to include parameters. This has been handled now as well.
* The check that requires both CompanyName and AppName to be configured did not give an error if no AppName was given. This has been fixed.
* Refreshing data in Mendix 7 where only calculated attributes were changed did not allways refresh the screen. By committing the settings records as a workaround the APM tools again functions as expected.
* The sorting of the trap tool messages has been set to show the error on top.
* The default settings for the trap tool buffer in production is now to stop the tool, so if a customer has a high volumne of errors and does not configure APM to exclude them the APM tool will stop, instead of cause some limited amount of load all the time.
* Statistics and message triggers did not stop after firing when configured to do so.
* Delete function now starts logging progress when it takes more than 5 seconds.
* To prevent out of memory the performance tool will stop recording at 80% memory usage and cancel and thus free memory at 95% memory usage.
* The JDBC settings for MSSQL were by default not correct after installation. This has been fixed.
* Trap errors often occur together, so now there is a previous/next button inside a trap to save some clicks.
* Java action parameters have been renamed to prevent errors when Mendix generates different names in different versions of the platform or in different deployments. Mendix does so to avoid conflicts in java due to generated proxies, but the consequence is an error in the model due to APM. This is what we now prevented.
