# Table of contents

## 1. App Store Content Support

Support on App Store content is determined by its content support category and the Service Level Agreement (SLA) one posesses. We distinguish the following content support categories:

_Mendix Platform content_

Mendix supports all content in this category when you are equipped with a SLA (**platform, gold** or **platinum**) with Mendix. Content in this category is proactively incorporated in R&D test cycles as part of our platform release management.     

_Mendix Community content _

Though developed by the community, Mendix supports all content in this category when you are equipped with a **gold** or **platinum** SLA. Content in this category will be proactively tested on compatibility with every Mendix Modeler release. 

_Community content_

Content is provided as-is by members of our community and support depends on availability and effort of the owner.

## 2\. Support level and process

We're always curious and grateful for your feedback. The way you can communicate your feedback to us depends on the content support category of the content.

### 2.1 Mendix Platform & Mendix Community

The applicable level of service for Mendix supported App Store content, is equal to the Mendix SLA you have acquired. In other words, the same SLA conditions apply for support on App Store content.

This means that equal response and resolve times are applicable and the standard support process, using our [support portal](https://support.mendix.com), has to be followed.

### 2.2 Community

Support on content in this category is up to the user or organisation providing the content. We recommend to contact the owner of the content in case of questions or issues by either;

*   [filing an issue on its GitHub repository](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) associated to the content (if available);
*   contact the the owner of the content by it's contact details which you can find on the content detail page in the App Store;
*   ask for help on our [forum](https://mxforum.mendix.com/).

Level of support depends on availability and effort of the developer and/or community. This means 'best effort' for content created by Mendix, in this category.
