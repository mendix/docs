## 1 Introduction

[Mendix Data Hub](https://hub.mendix.com), available in Studio Pro [8.14](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.14/) and above, helps you integrate app development with the data available from the many applications in an organization. Data Hub enables reliable data sources to be located centrally from one point and for users to connect to them through it. 

The [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) includes two main features:

* [External entities](/refguide/external-entities/) in Mendix Studio Pro version [8.14](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.14/#data-hub) and above, purple entities in the Domain Model that represent data provided through [published OData Services](/refguide/published-odata-services/)
* The [Data Hub Catalog](https://hub.mendix.com), documented in our [Data Hub Catalog](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/) guide, a metadata hub for managing shared registered assets made available through OData services

Discovering and using OData resources in [external entities](/refguide/external-entities/) is made easy for licensed users on a [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/), as [published OData REST Services](/refguide/published-odata-services/) are registered automatically in the [Data Hub Catalog](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/) and made available in the Studio Pro [Data Hub pane](/refguide/data-hub-pane/).

Try building an app by following [How to Share Data Between Apps](/data-hub/share-data/), and learn more about licensing in the [Data Hub License](/data-hub/#data-hub-licences) section of the *Data Hub Guide*.

## 2 Overview of Mendix Data Hub

Mendix Data Hub has components to enable the flexible sharing of datasets:

1. Apps and other software expose datasets in REST OData services. These are used with [external entities](/refguide/external-entities/). The data is stored in the respective source apps.
2. In Studio Pro, exposed OData services (or entity sets as they are named in Studio Pro) are automatically registered in the [Data Hub Catalog](/data-hub/data-hub-catalog/) when your app is deployed. OData services from other applications can also be manually registered in the Data Hub Catalog.
3. Search in the Data Hub Catalog or **Data Hub** pane in Studio Pro to find shared data assets to use.
4. Drag and drop to consume datasets in Studio Pro.  
5. The consuming application directly connects to the source system (as defined in the published service metadata) to use the data associated with the consumed dataset.

## 3 Roles in Data Hub {#data-hub-roles}

Shared datasets can be curated to ensure that resources can be found by the right users while maintaining their security. The Data Hub Catalog contains only metadata, not data.

This section describes the general Data Hub user as well as the assigned [Mendix Admin](#admin) and [Data Hub Curator](#curator) roles.

### 3.1 Catalog Users

The typical Mendix user is able to use the Data Hub Catalog to search and consume registered OData services. Users can also register new services, and as owners, curate them.

Data Hub Catalog users can do the following: 

* Publish services and register them in the Data Hub Catalog from Studio Pro
* Register published OData V4 Services for non-Mendix apps manually
* Update the metadata such as descriptions, tags, contact information, and discoverability of their own registered services
* See all the discoverable services and datasets registered in their organization’s Data Hub Catalog, and connect to the data by using the published entities as external entities in their apps in Studio Pro

### 3.2 Mendix Admin {#admin}

A Mendix Admin can do the following:

* Act as a [Mendix Admin](/developerportal/control-center/data-hub-admin/) of the organization’s Data Hub
* Assign [Data Hub Curator](#curator) roles
* Curate the Data Hub according to the organization's data governance policy
* Access all the registered assets in the Data Hub Catalog for the organization

For more information, see the [Data Hub](/developerportal/control-center/#data-hub) section of *Control Center*. 

#### 3.2.1 External Users

Mendix Admins can add **External Users** to their company's Catalog. See the [External Users](/developerportal/control-center/data-hub-admin/#external-users) section in *Data Hub Administration*.

### 3.3 Data Hub Curator {#curator}

The Data Hub Curator curates registered services in the Data Hub Catalog to ensure that registered services are visible to the relevant users and to enrich the information on registered assets. An organization can have several Data Hub Curators. 

Curators are assigned by the a [Mendix Admin](#admin) and can enrich the metadata of registered services and datasets – for example descriptions, tags, contact information, and discoverability

## 4 Data Hub Licenses {#data-hub-licences}

There are two types of licenses for Mendix Data Hub: Data Hub Free and Data Hub Premium.

Contact your [Mendix Admin](/developerportal/control-center/#company) to find out what type of Data Hub license your organization has.

### 4.1 Data Hub Free Edition {#dh-free}

All Mendix users have access to the Data Hub Free edition. With this, you can discover datasets provided by apps in your organization through OData REST services. You can retrieve or edit up to a 1000 objects per application per day for each runtime instance when deployed.

#### 4.1.1 Limitations {#dh-free-limitations}

If users with a Data Hub Free license retrieve or edit more than 1000 objects per application per day for each runtime instance when deployed, you will get a [limitation error](#limitation-errors) when your applications tries to retrieve more data. The number of consumed objects per day is reset at midnight in the time zone of the Mendix Runtime scheduler (which can be defined in the [Scheduled Event Time Zone](/refguide/app-settings/#scheduled) of the **App Settings**).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Apps running in development environments do not have this limitation.
{{% /alert %}}

#### 4.1.2 Limitation Errors {#limitation-errors}

Once the limit of a 1000 objects has been reached, two different statements are logged.

* On the `info` level, the following statement is logged when the limit is reached: `"Exceeded the daily limit. Retrieved $delta objects, which would increase the counter to $newCount (of max $max per day)."`
* On the `error` level, the following statement is logged when the limit is reached: `"The limit of $max objects has been reached."`

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
It is up to the application to communicate to its end-users that the daily limit has been reached. If this is not done, the end-user gets a message that an error occurred.
{{% /alert %}}

### 4.2 Data Hub Premium Edition {#dh-premium}

With the Data Hub Premium license, apps are not limited. Apps can retrieve and edit an unlimited number of objects using [external entities](/refguide/external-entities/).

### 4.3 Data Hub for Private Cloud or On-Premises {#dh-pc}

Licensed users of Mendix for [Private Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/) can use a Data Hub license to work with external entities. To learn more about working with Data Hub external entities on a private cloud, on-premises setup, or for local deployments, see [External Entities without Mendix Cloud](/data-hub/data-hub-without-mendix-cloud/).
