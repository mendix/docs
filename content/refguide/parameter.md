## 1 Introduction

A parameter is data that serves as input for the flow. Parameters are filled at the location from where the flow is triggered.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

When you have an object of the entity 'Customer' that you want to use in a microflow, a parameter is used. The object name is 'EnclosingCustomer' and is shown in black. The data type is object, therefore the entity name is shown underneath the object name in blue.
