In XPath, several keywords and system variables can be used called as a comparison.

## Keywords

*   `NULL`
*   `empty`

Either of these keywords can be used to check whether an attribute has a value (any value) or if it has been left empty.

See the following query:

```
//Sales.Customer[Name = NULL]

```

This query returns all customers whose name is not known to the system.

These keywords can only be used in conjunction with attributes. The existence of associations cannot be confirmed in this manner. Read [this page](xpath) for more information on how to constrain on associations.

## System variables

System variables can be used to obtain system or date related values. The following tokens are available:

Object related

| `[%CurrentUser%]` | GUID of the user currently logged on
 |
| --- | --- |
| `[%CurrentObject%]` | GUID of the active object (in the context)
 |

Userroles
These will be created for each userrole in your project. Here is an example:

| `[%UserRole_Administrator%]` | The userrole Administrator
 |
| --- | --- |

Time related

| `[%CurrentDateTime%]` | Current date and time |
| --- | --- |
| `[%BeginOfCurrentDay%]` | Date and time at the beginning of the current day |
| `[%EndOfCurrentDay%]` | Date and time at the end of the current day |
| `[%BeginOfCurrentHour%]` | Date and time at the beginning of the current hour
 |
| `[%EndOfCurrentHour%]` | Date and time at the end of the current hour |
| `[%BeginOfCurrentMinute%]` | Date and time at the beginning of the current minute |
| `[%EndOfCurrentMinute%]` | Date and time at the end of the current minute |
| `[%BeginOfCurrentMonth%]` | Date and time at the beginning of the current month |
| `[%EndOfCurrentMonth%]` | Date and time at the end of the current month |
| `[%BeginOfCurrentWeek%]` | Date and time at the beginning of the current week |
| `[%EndOfCurrentWeek%]` | Date and time at the end of the current week
 |

Period related (always use these tokens in combination with the tokens above)

| `[%DayLength%]` | Length of one day (24 hour) |
| --- | --- |
| `[%HourLength%]` | Length of one hour |
| `[%MinuteLength%]` | Length of one minute |
| `[%SecondLength%]` | Length of one second |
| `[%WeekLength%]` | Length of one week (seven days) |
| `[%YearLength%]` | Length of one year |

These variables must be used as string values, placed between two quotes. Time related tokens combined with period related tokens must be placed within one string. See example 3.

```
//Sales.Customer[DateRegistered >= '[%BeginOfCurrentWeek%]']

```

This query returns only customers who have registered since the beginning of this week.

```
//Sales.Customer[DateRegistered >= '[%BeginOfCurrentWeek%]' and DateRegistered < '[%EndOfCurrentWeek%]']

```

This query returns only customers who have registered this week.

```
//Sales.Customer[DateRegistered > '[%BeginOfCurrentDay%] - 3 * [%YearLength%]']

```

This query returns only customers who have registered in the past three years.

```
//System.User[System.UserRoles = '[%UserRole_Administrator%]']

```

This query returns users with the role Administrator

Because system variables are written as a string (between quotes)it is not possible to use parentheses to group expressions.
