Integration with other applications (other than Mendix) can be done using REST or SOAP/Web Services. Mendix can import and export data from XML and JSON.

Integration between Mendix applications is done best with App Services (see [Published App Services](published-app-services) and [Consumed App Services](consumed-app-services) ). Some of the most often used terms are explained below.
