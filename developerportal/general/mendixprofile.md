### 1.5 Team Server

Changes made through the Desktop Modeler are stored in the Mendix Team Server. 
This tab provides an overview of the revisions committed by you.

### 1.6 API Keys

In this tab you can view and create API keys which can be used by external applications to connect to the APIs of the Developer Portal on behalf of your user account. These keys allow you to execute operations (or have them executed on your behalf) which require authentication, but for which you would not want to pass your actual password. An example of this would be to use an API key to perform scripted operations on your application model with the Platform SDK.

For more information, see [Mendix Platform SDK](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk).
