## 1 Introduction

The [Google Maps](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/174/) module lets you work on latitude/longitude, among other features. The module contains a Java action that geocodes addressess with the Google geocoding service. All you need to do is connect the module to your user information entity with a reference.
