The **Cloud** page shows you an overview of the paid and free environments of your company

## 2 Paid Environments

The **Paid Environments** tab presents an overview of the licensed Mendix Cloud environments allocated to your company. This includes information on an environment's [Resource pack](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#resource-pack) and whether the [Fallback](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#fallback) option is included as part of a Premium plan.

When you select one or more environments via the checkboxes on the **Paid Environments**, a context menu appears at the bottom of the screen with the option for exporting environment details to an *.xlsx* file.

There are links to three other pages from this tab to allow you to [make requests to Mendix Support](/community-tools/support/submit-support-request/#submitting) to do the following:

* [Add Node](/community-tools/support/new-app-node-request-template/#new-node) – requests a new app node for a specific app and environment
* [Resize Environment](/community-tools/support/new-app-node-request-template/#resize) – requests a container size change
* [Offboard Environment](/community-tools/support/new-app-node-request-template/#offboard) – requests that an app is offboarded
