## 1 Introduction

The **WorkflowContext** parameter provides the means by which you can pass business-related data to the workflow. An entity that stores the business-related data has to be selected as the parameter type. When a workflow is triggered, the parameter is filled with the current object of the specified entity.

In the workflow editor, you can see the **WorkflowContext** parameter in the upper-left corner. In the image below, the parameter type (the specified entity) is shown in color blue and the parameter name is shown in color black.
