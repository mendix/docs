## Introduction

Epics is the default tool for you to manage the development process of new apps.  The Epics tool enables your team members to collaborate efficiently during the app development process. It supports the Scrum workflow and Kanban workflow.

## Opening an App in Epics

Open the app in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/myapps) and then go to the [Project Management](/developerportal/project-management/) section. This sections shows all the pages of the Epics tool:

* [Board](/developerportal/project-management/epics/board/)
* [Planning](/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/)
* [Epics](/developerportal/project-management/epics/epics/)
* [Archive Stories](/developerportal/project-management/epics/archive/)

After you open the app in Epics, you can easily switch to other apps that you have access to. To do so, click the name of the current app on the upper-left corner, and then select a different app from the drop-down list.
