## 4.0.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1085587 | Breaking | Moving elements now has to be done though the `detach()` function. For a full description of all the states and their meanings, see [Element States](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/element-states). This does not affect reading models and elements. |
| 1085587 | Breaking | Creating, deleting, and changing elements is restricted by their state. For a full description of all the states and their meanings, see [Element States](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/element-states). This does not affect reading models and elements. |
| 1031416 | Breaking | The `qualifiedName` property for an element that is not attached to the model now returns `undefined`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | Elements that have no `name` property (like `DomainModel`) no longer have a `qualifiedName` property. |
| 1031416 | Breaking | When assigning an element to a by-name reference (list) property, the element must have a valid qualified name first. This means that the element itself and any named containers should have a valid name. |
| 1085587 | Breaking | The following methods have been removed from the interface `IList<T>`: `intercept`, `move`, `observe`, `peek`. |
| 1109564 | Breaking | The property `typeName` that exists on every instance of a structure has been renamed to `structureTypeName`. All static `typeName` properties on structure classes are now called `structureTypeName` as well. (Ticket 49499) |
| 1116073 | Breaking | `Model.closeConnection` now no longer calls the (success) callback in addition to the model error handler when an error occurs while sending model changes to the server. Instead, it calls the error callback, or, in case the error callback is not supplied, the model error handler. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | The behavior of `ModelSdkClient.createWorkingCopy` has been changed so that it no longer opens the working copy right away. Instead, the specified callback gets passed an `IWorkingCopy` instance, which can be inspected or used to open the working copy. We have introduced the new method `ModelSdkClient.createAndOpenWorkingCopy` that mimics the old behavior. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We renamed `Model.metadata` to `Model.workingCopy`, as that name more accurately reflects its value. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We renamed the overload of `Structure.load()` that does not take a callback to `asLoaded()`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | All the interfaces for elements that are not part of the interface of their model unit have been removed, as these were not used in the SDK and served no further purpose (for example, `pages.IWidget` and all its derivatives). |
| 1052744 | Breaking | All the properties in interfaces for elements that are part of the interface of their model unit have become `readonly` to reflect the semantics of the model unit interfaces. If you want to change the value of such a property, you have to load the element using `.load(...)`, or you can use `.asLoaded()` to convert it to the class type if you know that the element is already loaded. |
| 1189165 | Breaking | The method `Structure.deepCopyInto` has been removed. A new method `Element.deepCopy` has been added. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | The interface `IDimension` has been removed, as it was never used. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We renamed the class `IEnum` to `AbstractEnum`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We removed setters for properties of the type `IList`. These setters were not really useful, as they required an argument of the type `IList`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | Specifying an error callback for `Model.getAppEnvironmentStatus`, `Model.getAppUpdateStatus` and `Model.startAppUpdate` is now required. The model error handler will no longer be used. |
| 1186227 | Breaking | The interface `IDelta` is no longer exposed and has been replaced by the type `Delta`, which is a union type of all the possible delta types. |
| 1031525 | Low | We changed the return type of `Model.findModuleByQualifiedName` to `projects.IModule`. |
| 1031525 | Low | `Structure.container` is now a read-only property. |
| 1031525 | None | `Structure.container` is now an observable property. |
| 1052744 | None | We changed the return type of `validateSyntax` to <code>string &#124; null</code>. |
| 1052744 | None | Assigning a false value such as `undefined` to a property now results in the property value actually becoming `null` instead. |
| 1026781 | None | We replaced Restler with Request. |
| 1126173 | None | Added support for Modeler version 7.3.0. |
