## 1 Introduction

Mendix uses visual models called microflows to define the logic of your application. A microflow is a visual way of expressing what traditionally would be written in code. This how-to explains how you can create a custom save button on a detail page by utilizing microflows.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a custom Save button

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Create a basic data layer (for details, see [How to Create a Basic Data Layer](../data-models/create-a-basic-data-layer))
* Create overview and detail pages for the customer object (for details, see [How to Create Your First Two Overview & Detail Pages](../ux/create-your-first-two-overview-and-detail-pages))
* Create a menu item to access the customer overview page (for details, see [How to Set Up the Navigation Structure](../ux/setting-up-the-navigation-structure))

## 3 Replacing the Default Save Button with a Custom Save Button

To replace the default Save button with a custom one, follow these steps:

1.  Open the **Customer** detail page, which should look like this:
