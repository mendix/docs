## Introduction

Your Mendix Profile is your main point of contact with members of the Mendix community. It displays your activities on the Mendix Platform and details about your background. To get more involved in the Mendix community, your profile is the best place to start. 

You can access your Mendix profile by clicking your picture in the upper-right corner of any page in the Mendix Portal (for example, [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/), the [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/),[Control Center](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/)) and then selecting **See Your Profile**.

By default, any newly created Mendix account comes with its own Mendix Profile.

## Header {#header}

Your profile header displays a quick overview of information about you. Your Mendix experience in level and points, your number of [credits](#challenges), and your number of [connections](#connections) are all found here. You can also select up to four featured [badges](#badges) to display your progress on the Mendix Platform. If you have a certificate from the Mendix [Academy](https://academy.mendix.com), this will also be displayed. The **Personal Info** card presents other information.

You can [edit your Mendix profile](/community-tools/mendix-profile/user-settings/) by clicking the settings ({{% icon name="cog" %}}) icon on the upper-right corner.

## Overview and Stats

Your profile opens to the **Overview** tab, which shows you at a quick glance how you are doing on the platform. You can see the following:

* Stats 
* Badges in progress and the next badges to work towards
* Assigned challenge
* Personal information
* Invitations
* Position on the leaderboard
* Portfolio

The first profile card below the header presents your **Stats**, which are your points divided between Mendix products and activities:

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/stats.png"   width="350"  class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Don't get disappointed about a low number of points, because everyone in the Mendix community started like that, even our Expert developers! There are plenty of opportunities to gain more points and climb the [Leaderboard](#leaderboard).
{{% /alert %}}

## Badges {#badges}

In addition to the **Stats** chart, on the **Overview** tab you gain an overview of your **Badges**. These badges represent your achievements and progress on the Mendix Platform. You can see your **Badges in Progress** as well as **Next Badges**. The badges are color-coded based from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare).

To see all your badges as well as the badges you can work towards, click **View all** to go to the **Badges** tab of your profile. On that tab, you can select up to four badges from the **Earned badges** section to make visible in your profile [header](#header) by clicking **Select as featured**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the **Earned badges** section, you find the badges you have completed. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown.
{{% /alert %}}

The percentage on the card of the **Badges in progress** shows how far you have come to earn that particular badge. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown, so don't get distracted while earning it!

## Challenges {#challenges}

The **Challenge** card presents a featured challenge you can complete to gain credits. You can use the credits in the [Mendix Shop](https://shop.mendix.com) to order low-code t-shirts or other Mendix swag. Some challenges are going to be easy for you, whilst others might be harder to complete!

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/challenges.png"   width="350"  class="no-border" >}}

Click **View All** to go to the **Challenges** tab of your profile. This tab presents more details on the challenge steps, the time left, and how many credits you can earn with them. You can complete these activities in any order you like.

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/credits.png"   width="350"  class="no-border" >}}

When you complete a challenge, click **Claim Credits** to claim the Mendix credits. You can then spend your credits on cool items in the Mendix Shop.

## Connections {#connections}

One of the greatest strengths of Mendix is our awesome developers community, and the **Connections** card is the perfect place to start connecting to other Mendix developers. When you get an invitation to connect, you can check out their profile and decide whether to accept or ignore it. 

You can also see a list of people you may know so that you can add further connections to your profile. To connect with someone, click the plus icon to send an invitation.

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/connections.png"   width="350"  class="no-border" >}}

Clicking **View All** on the card will bring you to the **Connections** tab of your profile. On this tab, you can invite friends and colleagues to Mendix in two ways:

* **Share URL** – copy the personalized invite link and share it directly
* **Send Invite** – send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address

## Leaderboard {#leaderboard}

This card on your profile presents your points and ranking for the last 30 days:

{{< figure src="/attachments/community-tools/mendix-profile/leaderboard.png" width="500px" alt="Leaderboard example" class="no-border" >}}

Clicking **View All** takes you to the **Leaderboards** page, where you can view leaders per category, for the whole Mendix Platform, or for your company only.

You can climb the leaderboard by earning points through various activities on the Mendix Platform. For example, let's say you have some time to spare while your app is deploying. You get a cup of coffee and check out the [Mendix Community](https://community.mendix.com/). One questions pops out because you came across a similar problem a few weeks back. You decide to help the community member and post an answer to their question. Not long after, the author marks your answer as accepted. Boom! 15 points right there.
