## 1 Introduction

Several apps which use push notifications will also need actions to trigger after a user taps a notification. This step-by-step guide will teach you to make a tapped notification show a specific page.

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Review the [basic differences](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/) between local notifications and push notifications
* Install the [Make It Native](/refguide/getting-the-make-it-native-app) app on your mobile device
* Complete the preceding tutorials in this [Use Local Notifications](local-notif-parent) series

## 3 Setting an Action for When a Notification is Tapped

In this section you will learn to show a page when a user taps a notification.

1.  Drag and drop a **Notifications** widget onto your native home page. 

	{{% image_container width="400" %}}![notifications widget](attachments/native-push/notif-widget.png){{% /image_container %}}

2. Double-click the widget.
3. Click **Actions** > **New**. 
4. Name your action *show_page*.
5. Select **On open to** > **Show a Page**.
6. Click **New** to make a new page.
7. Type *NotifPage* into **Page Name**.
8. Click **Blank** pane on the left and select the **Blank** page template. 
9. Click **OK** to create your page. 
10. Drag and drop an **Open page button** widget onto **NotifPage**.
11. When prompted, click your **Home_Native** page:

	{{% image_container width="400" %}}![click home page](attachments/native-push/home-native-select.png){{% /image_container %}}

12. Click **Select**. Now you have a button which will bring you back to your home screen when you are testing:

	![click home page](attachments/native-push/nav-button.png)

13. Navigate back to your **ACT_CreateAndSendNotification** nanoflow. 

In **ACT_CreateAndSendNotification** you will set up the logic for tapping a notification which brings you to a page. This process requires you set up a string variable. However, because this string variable will never be used with other variables — it will only be used for internal notification functionality — you will not set it up by dragging and dropping a create variable activity like you did before. You will set it up with an expression.

1.  Double-click your **Display Notification** activity:

	![click display notification](attachments/native-push/set-action-name-display.png)

2. Click **Action Name** > **Edit** 

	{{% image_container width="500" %}}![edit action name](attachments/native-push/add-action-name.png){{% /image_container %}}

3.  Type `'show_page'` into the expression field:

	{{% image_container width="400" %}}![show page expression](attachments/native-push/show-page-exp.png){{% /image_container %}}

4. Click the **OK** buttons until you are back at your nanoflow.

Great job setting up your notification. Now you can test it:

1. Click **Run Locally** to update your app.
2. Start the app on your mobile device.
3. Tap your **Send notification** button.
4. Tap the notification to navigate to the page you selected.
5. Tap the **Return to home page** button to navigate back to your home page.

Now you can show pages after notifications are tapped. Next, in [How to Use Local Notifications Part 4: Data](local-notif-data), you will learn to pass data to such pages.
