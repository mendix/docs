## 1 Domain Model

The sections below describe best practices for your solution's domain model.

### 1.1 Solution Module Defining the Data Model Core

Mendix recommends having the majority of your data model defined within solution modules in order to ensure stability. This also helps to maintain a clear separation between which entities, attributes, and associations come from the publisher and what is added during implementation. Finally, this also enables doing internal refactoring without having to take all customer instances into account.

### 1.2 Extension Through Extension Entities (Composition Pattern or Specializations)

In general, Mendix recommends using a separate extension entity with a one-to-many or one-to-one relationship owned by the core entity. This enables adding additional attributes and associations during the implementation. Using a separate entity also allows for the introduction or removal of extension capabilities without large data migration. 

Alternatively, it is possible to use specializations. Mendix recommends considering this as an alternative when the composition pattern does not solve the need.

| | Composition | Specializations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Easy to apply without data changes** | Yes, new extension objects can be created and linked to already existing core objects. | No, objects need to be re-created in order to change the entity/specialization type. |
| **Flexibility on security** | Core and extension have their own security rules. Core rules cannot be overridden. | Specialization allows for redefining security rules, even for entities that are defined inside solution modules. |
| **Multiple extension versions** (for example, `Vehicle` becomes both `Car` and `Train`). | Setup can be complex. | More suitable. |
| **Offline synchronization** | Fully supported. | Restrictions apply (for details, see [Offline Best Practices](/refguide/mobile/building-efficient-mobile-apps/offlinefirst-data/best-practices/#inheritance)). |

### 1.3 Example

Here is an example:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/creating-content/sol-solutions-guide/sol-adapt/sol-adaptability-best-practices/adaptability-domain-model-example.png" alt="Example of data model extensions"  class="no-border" >}}

In this example, the following details apply:

* **Company** is extended through composition, because that is the recommended approach and there are no requirements to reconsider. Additional entities can be created and linked (such as, the **AccountManager**).
* **Vehicle** is extended through specializations, because every customer can have multiple vehicle types (for example, car, train).
* **Task** is extended through a specialization, because every customer has very unique requirements on entity access.
* **Logo** is not extensible.

## 2 Making Part of the Logic Adaptable

You can make logic (microflows, nanoflows, and workflows) adaptable by placing documents into the open application modules. By using sub-flows, you can decide whether the entire flow can be adapted, or only specific parts thereof.

| Purpose | Calling Flow | Called (Sub-) Flow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Split (re-) usable core logic into (reusable) microflows | Solution module (usable) | Open application module |
| Make part of hidden core logic adaptable | Solution module (hidden) | Open application module |
| Make part of (re-) usable core adaptable | Solution module (usable) | Open application module |
| Reuse core logic in an adaptable microflow | Open application module  | Solution module (usable) |
| Split adaptable microflow | Open application module  | Open application module (newly created flow) |

{{% alert color="info" %}}
All document types can be part of the solution module, but only nanoflows, microflows, and Java actions can be made usable.

## 3 Creating an Adaptable UI

The same patterns that can be used for microflows can be used for making pages (partially) adaptable. For this, you can use a combination of (hidden) pages, editable layouts, and snippets.

| | Open App Module/UI Resource Module | Solution Module |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| **Page** | Adaptable pages. | Core pages can be hidden and called through microflows and nanoflows. |
| **Snippet** | Making (parts) of the UI adaptable. | Core snippets can be hidden as long as it is for reuse in hidden core pages. |
| **Layout** | Main layout for the application. Use a solution-specific [master layout](/refguide/layout/#master-layout) to eanble changing the layout of all (adaptable and hidden) pages by the customer. | Core layouts can be hidden and use an adaptable master layout. |
| **Building block** | Building blocks that are supposed to be used during adaptation need to reside in an open module. | Building blocks that are used during development of the core solution can be hidden. |
| **SASS files** | Define the theme and look and feel of your app. | No SASS definition support. Usage of existing theme and design properties as well as additional styling can be done through inline styling only. |

The app title, favicon, and login pages are always adaptable, since they live at the app level.

### 3.1 Cascading Theming Modules

For solution development, Mendix recommends using a layered approach to your theme modules to make them as adaptable as possible (for more information, see the [Brand Your Adaptable Solution](https://academy.mendix.com/link/paths/130/Brand-your-Adaptive-Solution) learning path, which includes details on how to structure your SASS files).

An ISV that maintains multiple adaptable solutions can structure their theme modules in the following way:

| Module | Implemented by | Shared by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Atlas Core | Mendix | All ISV solution and customer implementations | Base for all Mendix Apps |
| ISV theme | ISV (shared UX team) | All ISV solution and customer implementations | Contains the default ISV theming |
| ISV solution specific | ISV (solution R&D team) | All customer implementations of this particular ISV solution | Additional styling for an individual solution |
| Customer theme | Customer implementation team | All customer implementations of any solution of the ISV | Overriding ISV-specific logic for a customer (for example, color palette and typography) |
| Customer app- specific | Customer implementation team | Customer implementation of a specific solution of the ISV | Overriding the styling for a specific customer instance |

{{% alert color="info" %}}
For an ISV with a single solution, this can be reduced to three modules (Atlas Core, ISV theme, and customer theme).
{{% /alert %}}

In general, Mendix recommends being explicit regarding the used design system (and creating the relevant building blocks) to allow for a consistent look and feel across the adaptation and core UI.

## 4 Using Constants

The default value of a usable constant cannot be overridden at implementation, but the local Studio Pro value can be changed using the [Mendix Runtime settings](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#constants). Constants can always be configured as part of the environment settings (including hidden constants).

For more information, see [Constant Default Value](/refguide/constants/#default-value) in the *Studio Pro Guide*.

## 5 Translating the Implementation and Implementing Jargon

In order to make the application translatable during implementation, all translatable documents need to be stored in open application modules. Using the [batch translate](/refguide/batch-translate/) and [batch replace](/refguide/batch-replace/) features, the text can be translated or updated during implementation. This can be done, for example, to implement jargon by changing a default concept like “Asset” into a customer-specific word such as “Car” .

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only adaptable content can be translated, since protected content is locked down.
{{% /alert %}}

Variables cannot (easily) be translated, nor can text be changed in a protected microflow (since this is locked down). As a workaround for this, consider using an editable Enumeration as an “internationalization map” combined with the [getCaption](/refguide/enumerations-in-expressions/#get-caption) function. 

## 6 Java Source Code Protection

Setting the export level to **Hidden** on a Java action prevents the unpacking of the action in the app directory in the same path as regular modules. Your Java code is put in a package, but no obfuscation or other security measures take place. This means that reverse engineering the package would reveal your source code.

Mendix does not offer a facility to further protect intellectual property in your Java files. For further protection, Mendix recommends using other software (for example, to obfuscate your source code).
