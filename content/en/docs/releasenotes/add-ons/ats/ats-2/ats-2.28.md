## 2.28.0

**Release date: October 11th, 2022**

### Fixes

* We fixed a UI error that occurred when deleting a scheduled test case/suite.
* We fixed recording of TabContainer, NavigationListItem, and InputReferenceSetSelector for Studio Pro 9.
* We added support for the drop-down container (as the replacement for the custom `DropDownDivConverter` widget in Studio Pro 9).
