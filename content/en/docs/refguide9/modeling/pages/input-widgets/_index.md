## 1 Introduction

Input elements show data to the end-user and, optionally, allow them to edit the data.

Input elements need to be linked to an attribute of an entity in order to function. As such, they must be placed within a data widget containing by an object of that entity type.

For example, the input elements can be placed inside a [data view](/refguide9/data-view/):

There are several different input elements, these are used for different [data types](/refguide9/data-types/) and for different types of [association](/refguide9/associations/). The input elements category contains the following widgets:

* [Text Box](/refguide9/text-box/) – displays and, optionally, allows the end-user to add or edit text data from a *numeric* or *string-like* attribute:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/pages/input-widgets/text-box.png" alt="Text box containing Name attribute" class="no-border" >}}

* [Text Area](/refguide9/text-area/) – displays and, optionally, allows the end-user to add or edit long text data from a *string* attribute:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/pages/input-widgets/text-area.png" alt="Text area containing notes attribute" class="no-border" >}}

* [Drop-Down](/refguide9/drop-down/) – shows the current value of and, optionally, allows end-users to pick an option from a list of options in an *enumeration* attribute:
