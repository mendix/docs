## Introduction

The **Page Explorer** shows the structure of your page in a tree view:

The **Page Explorer** is a simplified page view that makes the page building easier. In combination with [Design mode](/refguide/page/#design-mode) it allows you to view and edit nested containers which are hard to see and select in the WYSIWYG editor. However, it can be used in combination with [Structure mode](/refguide/page/#structure-mode) as well, for example, to get a quick overview of the page.

## Performing Basic Functions

In the **Page Explorer**, you can do the following:

* Add or move widgets via drag-and-drop
* Copy, paste, and delete widgets
* Open widget properties (the **Properties** pane is opened when you select a widget; alternatively, you can double-click the widget in the **Page Explorer** to open the **Properties** dialog box)
* Open the same context menu as the page editor, with the additional option to add widgets and building blocks
* Expand/collapse structure widgets to focus on one area of the page structure
