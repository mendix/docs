This document describes how entities are represented in a published OData service.

<small><sup>1Â </sup>Even though the binary data type is not supported, the FileDocument and Image system entities are supported and represented as Base64-encoded strings with the `Edm.Binary` type.<br />
<sup>2</sup> When using Excel to import an OData source, long numbers may seem cut off. This is due to a restriction in the data type Microsoft uses. See [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/269370](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/269370) for more information.</small>

Additionally, the `updated` field for an entry in OData comes from the system changedDate attribute of an entity. If this attribute is not available (because it is not exposed, the user does not have access rights, or it is empty in database), the default date (1-1-1970) will be used.

## 2 Associations {#associations}

In the settings of the OData service, you can choose how associations are represented. There are two options, which are described below.

### 2.1 As a Link

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This was introduced in version 7.21.
{{% /alert %}}

When you choose to represent associations as links, each object contains a link for each of its associations. The associated object(s) can be retrieved via those links.

This means that you can only expose an association when the entity on the other side is a resource of this service as well. This also means that you cannot publish the same entity more than once in the same service (because in that case, it would not be clear where the link should point to).

Using this method, you can expose both sides of the association and you can expose many-to-many associations.

### 2.2 As an Associated Object ID

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This feature has been deprecated since version 7.21.
{{% /alert %}}

When you choose to represent assocations as an associated object ID, the ID of the associated object is represented as an `Edm.Int64` property. If the association refers to more than one object, you can not expose it from that side.
