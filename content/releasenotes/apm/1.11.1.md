## 1.11.1

This is a release with bug fixes. It is for Mendix 6.2 and above.

### Other fixes and improvements


* When defining a action 'Create trap message' in the trigger configuration. The trap was not created and linked to the triggered event. Both issues are fixed.
* Creating the sample data failed because the attribute Frequency was set to empty and in Mendix 6.8.1 the validation rules behave differently. Frequency does always get a value now.
