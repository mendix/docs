## 1 Introduction

The [Badge](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/50325/) widget shows a value inside a colored badge or label.

To see the component in the Mendix Marketplace, click here:

{{% button color="dark" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/50325/" text="See component in Marketplace" title="See component in Marketplace" %}}

The widget does the following:

* Displays a value based on a configured text template
* Becomes a fully accessible button when an On click action is configured
* Offers brand styling with the **Style** design property

## 2 Configuration

To configure the Badge widget, do the following:

1. Place the widget in a data container like a Data view, List view, or Template grid widget.
1. Navigate to the **General** tab and configure the value to be displayed. The value may be configured empty as well.

Optionally, you can configure the widget further:

* Choose whether the badge should display itself like a badge or label by setting the **Type** configuration property
* Select an On click action to convert the badge into a button, which will execute this action when clicked on or activated with an <kbd>{Enter}</kbd> or <kbd>{Space}</kbd> key press
* Navigate to the **Appearance** tab and select a brand style with the **Style** design property to give the badge or label a suitable color
