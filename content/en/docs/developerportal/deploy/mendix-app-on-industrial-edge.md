## 1 Introduction

[Industrial Edge](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/topic-areas/industrial-edge/production-machines.html) is the Siemens IOT platform for hosting applications from different vendors on a computing platform close to the shopfloor. Industrial Edge (IE) enables extensive connectivity to automation and other operational technology (OT) equipment, while allowing the deployments of demanding edge applications to locally process shopfloor data.

Mendix on Edge empowers factory operators to create custom applications with the Mendix low-code platform that run locally as Edge Apps. Among its other tools, Industrial Edge provides the [Industrial Edge Plugin for Mendix Studio Pro](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/218436), a tool extending Mendix Studio Pro seamlessly on a development PC which supports the developer with publishing Mendix apps into the Industrial Edge Environment.

This documentation is meant for Mendix developers who want to develop and use their apps in the Industrial Edge environment.

## 2 Prerequisites

For information about the dependencies and prerequisites to use Mendix on Edge, see [Mendix on Edge](https://docs.eu1.edge.siemens.cloud/develop_an_application/mendix/user_journey.html).

## 3 Pushing your App to Industrial Edge by Using the IE Plugin for Mendix Studio Pro

For more information about pushing your applications to the Industrial Edge Hub, see [Get started](https://docs.eu1.edge.siemens.cloud/get_started_and_operate/industrial_edge_hub/setup/ieh_index.html).

For more information about pushing your applications to the Industrial Edge Management system, see [Industrial Edge Management - Overview](https://docs.eu1.edge.siemens.cloud/develop_an_application/mendix/user_journey.html).

After your app is uploaded to your Industrial Edge environment, it is treated like any other native IE application, for example those purchased over the Industrial Edge Marketplace.

## 4 Deploying and Installing Apps on Industrial Edge

For a step-by-step guide for setting up and operating your Industrial Edge environment and installing applications on your Industrial Edge Devices, see [Get Started & Operate - Overview](https://docs.eu1.edge.siemens.cloud/get_started_and_operate/index.html).
