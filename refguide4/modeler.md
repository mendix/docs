The Mendix Business Modeler is the place where you create, view and edit your Mendix application. This is called a [project](project) in the Modeler. A project consists of many documents that are grouped in [modules](modules) and folders. There are some project-level settings but the core of the functionality will be inside modules. Examples of documents are the [project settings](project-settings), [domain model](domain-model), [forms](forms) and [microflows](microflows). The Modeler can have one project open at the same time. You can, however, open two Modeler instances when necessary.

This documentation describes the interface of the Modeler. The rest of the documentation follows the structure of the project explorer.

## Dockable Windows

The Modeler sports quite a number of dockable windows or docks. You can close some to just show the ones you are interested in at the moment. You can always reopen them by using the View menu. Here is a table with all available dockable windows.

| Dockable window | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Breakpoints | Shows all breakpoints in the project. You can enable/disable breakpoints from here. |
| Changes | For [Team Server](team-server) projects, this dock shows the local changes to the project since the last commit. You can commit changes, update to the latest revision and view the history from here. |
| Connector | Shows what elements can be connected to the currently selected element. For example, when a button is a selected, the connector will show microflows that you can drag and drop onto the button to connect them. |
| Console | Shows the output of the Mendix Business Server while running an application. |
| Debugger | Added in Mendix 4.3\. This can be used to debug your application. |
| Documentation | Shows the documentation for the currently selected element (if applicable). |
| Error List | Shows the errors and warning currently in your project. |
| Find Results | Shows the results of the latest find action. You can search for text, for usages of an element (e.g. attribute) and for unused items. There are two find results docks. If you lock the results of the first dock, the second one will be used for subsequent find operations until you unlock it. |
| Project Explorer | Shows the complete structure of your project including all documents inside the modules. By default the active document is always selected in the project explorer so you can quickly see where the document you are editing is in the tree. You can change this behavior in the preferences window (menu Edit > Preferences). |
| Properties | Shows properties of the currently selected element. This is where a lot of editing in the Modeler takes place. |
| Stories | For [Team Server](team-server) enabled projects, this dock shows the stories of the current sprint. |
| Toolbox | Shows the tools that can be used in the current editor. For example, in a form you can insert all kinds of widgets (text box, data view etc.) by dragging them from the toolbox to your form. |
| Variables | Added in Mendix 4.3\. You can view the current values of variables here when debugging your application. |

## Document Tabs

Documents that you are viewing and/or editing at the moment are shown in tabs. You can have any number of tabs open just like in a modern web browser. They can be closed, reordered, and shown side by side. Each document has its own save state (are there unsaved changes?) and undo history/future. Undo and redo are unlimited.
