| MS-287 | Low | From now on, we disallow deleting detached elements. Either delete the element directly, or re-attach it before deleting it. |
| 1196423 | None | We added a `filterUnitsByCustomWidgetId` API to enable trusted backends to find units containing a specific custom widget type. |
| 1197518 | None | It is now possible to specify the `workingCopyId` instead of getting a randomly generated one when creating a new working copy. This feature can only be used by trusted backends. |
| MS-216 | None | We removed the `getEditorData` internal API. |
| MS-296 | None | We added support for Modeler versions 7.4.0 and 7.5.0. |
