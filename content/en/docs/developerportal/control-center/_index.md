In general, a "member" in Control Center means a Mendix Platform user who participates in the development, deployment, and maintenance of an app, and does not mean the end-user of a Mendix app built on the Mendix Platform. The only exception is the  [Groups](#groups) page where a "member" means the end-user of a Mendix app.
{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

When you sign up on the Mendix Platform, you are able to create new apps, invite other users to your app teams, deploy your apps, and invite app end-users to give feedback, among many other activities. Insights into these company activities are provided in Control Center in one central overview. These insights will help you to be in control and remain aware of everything happening within the Mendix landscape of your company.

The [Mendix Control Center](https://controlcenter.mendix.com/) consists of the pages described below, which are for use by [Mendix Admins](#company).

If your company does not already have a Mendix Admin, you will see a page that outlines the usage and goals of Control Center. You can also recommend a colleague for Mendix Admin status by clicking **Suggest a Mendix Admin**.

If your company already has a Mendix Admin but you yourself are not a Mendix Admin, you will see this page:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/control-center/admin-exists.jpg" >}}

If you are a Mendix Admin, you will immediately see the [Dashboard](#dashboard) page and can navigate to the pages described below.

## 2 Dashboard {#dashboard}

The Control Center dashboard gives you an overview of various activities for your company on the Mendix Platform:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/control-center/dashboard.png" >}}

These are some examples of what you can find on the dashboard:

* **Apps Created** – you can filter these [apps](#apps) by date
* **Mendix Versions** – describes which Studio Pro/Mendix versions your internal and external [members](#members) are using for apps, which is especially important as the development of apps on outdated or [non-MTS/LTS versions](/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/) can lead to security issues
* **Certification Level** – presents the number of members per [Mendix certification](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certification)
* **External Members** – click a part of this pie chart to see a list of external members from a specific company
* **Company Feed** – presents events in your company, such as members joining the company and the created app

## 3 Apps {#apps}

### 3.1 Active and Deactivated Apps {#active-deactivated}

#### 3.1.1 Overview {#overview}

On the **Active Apps** tab and the **Deactivated Apps** tab, you can see an overview of the active and deactivated apps that belong to your company.

## 4 Members {#members}

Members are users who can view and/or edit an app.

### 4.1 Active and Deactivated Members

On the **Active Members** tab and the **Deactivated Members** tab, you can see an overview of the active and deactivated members of your company.

When you click a member's name, a pop-up window opens with their member profile. The profile displays the apps of which they are a member as well as their **App role** for each app. Click an app name to go to the [details page](#app-details) of this app.

When you select members in the lists on these tabs, a context menu appears with options for exporting member details to an *.xlsx* file and deactivating (on the **Active Members** tab) or activating (on the **Deactivated Members** tab) members.

For security reasons, we recommend that you deactivate an employee that is leaving your company (if the employee returns to your company, they can be activated as a member again).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You cannot deactivate yourself.
{{% /alert %}}

### 4.2 External Members

On the **External Members** tab, you can see the members outside of your company who have access to at least one of your company apps.

{{% /alert %}}

## 5 Groups {#groups}

A Mendix Admin can set up **App Access Groups**, which consist of end-users (who are active members of your company) who will have access to [Mendix SSO](/appstore/modules/mendix-sso/)-enabled apps with specific environments and roles. Click **Add Access Group** to create a new group with a **Name** and **Description**.

Click a group name to bring up the group details pop-up window, and click **Add Member** to add members to the group. When you add members to an app access group, they will automatically be granted access to the apps listed on **Accessible Apps** tab. After you select an app to be accessible for the group, you also need to select a specific app [environment](/developerportal/deploy/environments/) node to be accessible, in addition to specific [user roles](/refguide/user-roles/) that should be able to access the app.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/control-center/access-group.jpg" >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
You can only add apps that utilize [Mendix SSO](/appstore/modules/mendix-sso/) to App Access Groups.
{{% /alert %}}

When you select groups in the list or members or accessible apps in the group details page, a context menu will appear with options for exporting item details to an *.xlsx* file, deleting access groups, removing members from access groups, and removing accessible apps.

## 6 Company Settings {#company}

### 6.1 General Settings {#company-general-settings}

On the **General Settings** tab of this page, you can edit your **Company Name** and **Description**.

You can request new **Company Email Domains** by clicking **Add Domain**, upon which a request is sent to [Mendix Support](/developerportal/support/). Once a domain is added, every user who signs up to Mendix with that email domain will be assigned to your company.

If you have [configured single sign on using BYOIDP](/developerportal/control-center/set-up-sso-byoidp/), you will have to wait until the domain has been added, then deactivate and reactivate BYOIDP to pick up the new email domain. It is not possible to add email domains which do not use single sign-on if it is activated for your company.

To export all the email domains, use the **Export to Excel** button.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/control-center/company-email-domains.png" width="650px" >}}

You can also provide a specific **Security Contact** who is informed if there are critical security issues with the Mendix Platform and platform-supported Marketplace components. Mendix strongly recommends applying a team email address or a functional mailbox instead of a personal individual email address.

After you click **Add security contact** and add the required **Name** and **Email** address, a confirmation email is sent to the proposed contact. The recipient has seven days to click the link in the email and validate the Security Contact request. After seven days, the pending request is automatically removed. If the recipient has not received the confirmation email but is still within the seven-day validation timeframe, you can click **Resend confirmation email**.

For an existing **Security Contact**, there are two menu options available:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/control-center/security-contact.png" >}}

Click **Edit** to edit the Security Contact's **Name**.

Click **Delete** to delete the existing Security Contact. This is the first step in changing a validated Security Contact. After you make the deletion, you can add the new Security Contact.

For more information on security issues, see [Security Advisories](/releasenotes/security-advisories/).

### 6.2 Mendix Admins
