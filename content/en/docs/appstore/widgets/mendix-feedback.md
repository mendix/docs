{{% alert color="warning" %}}
**All Mendix Feedback widgets with versions lower than 8.4.0 are disabled as of October 1st, 2022. If you are using one of these versions, download and replace your current [Mendix Feedback](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/199/) widget with version 8.4.0 or higher.**

The feedback provided via a widget version lower than 8.4.0 is no longer sent to the [Feedback](/developerportal/collaborate/feedback/) section of the Developer Portal, but your app will keep working as usual.

If you are using the [Native Mobile Resources](/appstore/modules/native-mobile-resources/) module (which also includes a version of the Mendix Feedback widget), upgrade to version 3.5.1 or higher.

In case of any questions, contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us).

## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix Feedback](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/199/) widget allows end-users of your application to directly submit feedback into your app. The feedback widget is fully integrated with the [Feedback](/developerportal/collaborate/feedback/) page in the Developer Portal, where you can review feedback and convert it into [user stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/) to improve your app.

To see the component in the Mendix Marketplace, click here:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/feedback-in-app.png" >}}

The Mendix Feedback widget is easy to set up and automatically attaches additional information to each submitted issue such as the user’s name, role, active form, browser version, and screen resolution.

### 1.1 Typical Usage Scenario

* Gathers feedback from end-users in an acceptance or production environment
* Reduces the length of the feedback loop

### 1.2 Features

* Gathers detailed information about the client state

### 1.3 Limitations

* This widget can only be used in combination with Mendix apps
* In native mobile apps, some of the feedback metadata such as username, email address, and document name will be hard-coded, as they cannot be retrieved dynamically (to address this you can use the [Native Feedback widget](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/native-mobile-resources/) instead, located in [Native Mobile Resources](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/109513))

## 2 Configuration {#configuration}

You can configure the widget for certain actions in your app. All the configuration properties are explained on the various tabs of the properties dialog box for the widget. The feedback feature requires the following properties to be set:

* **Project** tab
    * **App ID** – the unique identifier of your app, which you can find in your app’s [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) in the Developer Portal

        {{% alert color="info" %}}The original value of **App ID** is 1, but this value should automatically change to your correct app ID. If it does not change automatically, see [Updating App ID](#update-app-id) below.
        {{% /alert %}}

        **Allow screenshots** – controls whether the app user can take a screenshot or not
* **Advanced** tab
    * **Feedback server location** – the URL of the Developer Portal server (usually `https://feedback-api.mendix.com`), which you should only change when you are using a different environment
    * **Screenshot Foreign Rendering**
        * **No** (default)
        * **Yes** – only used when the page includes sensitive information
* **Authentication** tab

    {{% alert color="info" %}}For the best user experience, your are strongly encouraged to apply Mendix SSO to your app and connect the Mendix SSO module to the Mendix Feedback widget version 8.2.1 or above. Choose only one of the authentication methods: either **MendixSSO** or **Custom Authentication**.</br></br>You need to enter the value of authentication items manually as currently the widget does not support a drop-down menu for selecting microflow or the attributes of an entity.{{% /alert %}}

    * **MendixSSO** – if Mendix SSO is applied and the following settings are configured correctly, the end-user can leave feedback without having to enter their name and email address
        * **ID token microflow** – recommended that you select the **DS_GetCurrentIdToken** microflow from the Mendix SSO module. 
        {{% alert color="info" %}}If you are using MendixSSO 3, please follow the [Create a New Microflow to Retrieve DecryptedToken](#create-a-new-microflow-to-retrieve-decryptedtoken) section below.{{% /alert %}}
        * **Decrypted Token Value** – recommended that you select the **Value** attribute from it (the default if **Value** in the MendixSSO module). 

        See the screenshot below for an example:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/mendixsso-authentication.png" >}}

    * **Custom Authentication** – if you are using an SSO solution other than the Mendix SSO module, you should configure the following settings. With these settings, you can provide a microflow that should return a valid username and email when the end-user is signed in with your authentication solution. If the end-user is not signed in (meaning the **User Object Provider** microflow returns an empty username or an invalid email address) the end-user will have to manually enter their name and email address when they leave feedback.
        * **User object microflow** – selects the microflow that returns **User** entity from your module
        * **User object** – selects the **User** entity
        * **User name attribute**– selects the attribute of **name** from the **User** entity
        * **Email attribute** – selects the attribute of **email** from the **User** entity

        See the screenshot below for an example:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/custom-authentication.png" >}}

## 3 Usage

### 3.1 Adding the Widget to Your app

You should use the latest version of the Mendix Feedback widget, as it will provide the most up-to-date features for leaving feedback and communicating with the team. To ensure you have the latest version of the widget included in your app, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the Mendix Feedback widget from the Marketplace. You are strongly encouraged to use version 8.6.0 or above of the widget.
1. When the widget is included in your app, ensure that it is added to the home page of the application:
    1. Open the home page, In the App Explorer, go to Navigation and click **Show** as shown in the screenshot:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/show-homepage.png" >}}

    1. If the widget has not been added automatically, add it as follows:
        1. In the **Toolbox**, find Feedback widget in the **Add-ons** category
        1. Drop it into a position in the page:

            {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/feedback-added.png" >}}

You can place the widget on any form in your app, but it needs to be placed on only one form. When the end-user accesses that form, the widget will remain in the browser until the session is expired. This means you only need to place the widget on the home form. You can use this mechanism to limit the feedback to certain user roles as well. To do that, just place the widget on their home forms but not on the home form of other users.

### 3.2 Submitting Feedback on an App

When you click the **Feedback icon**, the Mendix Platform first checks if you are signed in. If you are not signed in, you will need to either **Sign in to Mendix** or **Continue as a guest** to enter feedback mode:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/feedback-login.png" >}}

Once you are in feedback mode, you can click anywhere on the screen to **leave a comment**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/comment.png" >}}

And voila! A screenshot of the current page is created, which you can choose to attach to your feedback. After clicking **Submit**, your feedback will go straight to the [Feedback](/developerportal/collaborate/feedback/) page of the app in the Developer Portal.

When you have left your feedback, you need to exit the feedback mode by clicking **Exit Feedback Mode**:
{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/exit-feedback-mode.png" >}}

### 3.3 Upgrading the Widget 

To upgrade your Mendix Feedback widget, follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/#update-module). You can encounter the following error: 

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/install-error.png" >}}

When this happens, right-click the error message, and choose **Update widget** or **Update all widgets**. Then the name of the widget is changed to **Feedback**. The updated widget is ready for use.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/new-name.png" >}}

## 4 Troubleshooting

### 4.1 Updating App ID on the Project Tab {#update-app-id}

The value of the **App ID** on the **Project** tab will be changed to your correct app ID automatically from the original value 1. 

If it did not change to your app ID because of an unexpected error, you can update the app ID manually. You can find the app ID in your app's [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) in the Developer Portal.

### 4.2 Page Does Not Scroll in the Screenshot Image

The Feedback widget uses the HTML2Canvas library which attempts to make an image of a web page based on the content currently loaded on the page. Since HTML2Canvas tries to repaint the current content, it can make mistakes while doing so. There are two solutions for the issue:

* Turn off **Screenshot foreign rendering**
* Change the **CSS selector** for a scrollable container - Some variations are difficult to spot for HTML2Canvas. This sometimes causes the image to render incorrectly. Fixing this requires significant CSS, HTML, and JS knowledge, but it is possible to fill in a CSS selector that will determine where the scrolling is happening.

### 4.3 Feedback Item Does Not Show on the Developer portal

If you cannot see your feedback items on the Developer Portal's **Feedback** page, it is possible that you have configured a wrong **App ID** or **Feedback server location**. Please check if all the configurations are filled in per the [Configuration](#configuration) section above.

### 4.4 Creating a New Microflow to Retrieve DecryptedToken {#create-a-new-microflow-to-retrieve-decryptedtoken}

In MendixSSO 3, the Microflow **DS_GetCurrentIdToken** is deprecated. You will need to create a new microflow in your own module to retrieve the **DecryptedToken**. Place **SUB_GetDecryptedTokenByTypeForCurrentSession** in this new microflow, and then use it in MendixSS authentication:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/get-current-token.png" >}}
{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/example.png" >}}

The **tokenType** argument is **MendixSSO.TokenType.ID_TOKEN**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/widgets/mendix-feedback/token-type.png" >}}

### 4.5 Widget Cannot Be Read 

If you see the following error, click **close** and then go to your widget folder to remove the duplicate old widget.
