For details on how this works in Mendix versions 7.2 and 7.3, see [Navigation in 7.2 and 7.3](navigation-in-72-and-73). For Mendix version 7.4 and higher, see [Navigation](navigation).

As of Mendix 7.0.2, the offline device profile is replaced by the [hybrid phone profile](hybrid-phone-profile). All the settings from the offline device profile are automatically copied to the hybrid phone profile.
