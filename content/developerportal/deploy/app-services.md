## 1 Introduction

The **App Services** page provides an overview of possible resources that can be published to the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/):

* **App Service**
* **Application**
* **Widget**

## 2 App Service

App services are aimed at sharing functionality between your Mendix apps. You can create app services in the Mendix Modeler and publish the created app content and functionality within your company or to the entire Mendix Community. Users of your app service can directly drag actions that you designed into their microflows in the Modeler and use your entities and data in their apps. 

On the **App Service** page, you can see a list of the available app services, with whom the app service is shared, and what the current statuses are.
