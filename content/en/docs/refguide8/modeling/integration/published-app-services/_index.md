## 1 Introduction

{{% alert color="info" %}}
App services are deprecated and were removed in Studio Pro 9. Use a [published web service](/refguide8/published-web-services/) or a [published REST service](/refguide8/published-rest-services/) instead.
{{% /alert %}}

An app service can be created via **File** > **New Document**.

Names of published app service documents must be unique (also with regard to published web service).
