## 7.18.0

**Release date: August 28th, 2018**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "7.18.0" %}}

### Productivity Improvements

* We greatly reduced the time it takes Desktop Modeler to update the **Errors** in the project after you make a change. You can expect the check time to be well below a second now, which is a more than 10-fold win for bigger projects.
* We improved the dialog box used to create new branch lines. It no longer fetches all tags before opening and the default has been switched to **Main line**.
* The **Select Ports** dialog box now can be resized horizontally to make long names readable.

#### Show WSDL and XSD

In [consumed web services](/refguide/consumed-web-service) and [XML schemas](/refguide/xml-schemas), we added a **Show** button that shows the content of the WSDL or XML schema file that was imported.

#### Choose Not to Commit an Import Mapping

For import mappings in the [import mapping action](/refguide/import-mapping-action#commit), [call REST service action](/refguide/call-rest-action), and [call web service action](/refguide/call-web-service-action), you can now [specify whether you want to commit the changes or not](/refguide/import-mapping-action#commit).

This is based on a [suggestion by Martin Leppen](https://forum.mendixcloud.com/link/questions/90534). Cheers, Martin!

#### Java action parameter categories

You can now group the parameters of [java actions](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/java-actions) into categories. This gives a better overview in [java action calls](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/java-action-call), especially where there are many parameters.

### {New feature or improvement specifically named in heading}

### New Features

* It is now possible to use templates as the label of an input widget. This was inspired by idea https://forum.mendixcloud.com/link/ideas/567 from the ideas forum.
* We added support for using a private version control server in combination with a proxy server. If your private version control server is not behind the proxy server, you can make an exception for it in the 'Internet Options' control panel: Connections > LAN settings > Advanced > Exceptions. (Ticket 57171)
* In [import and export mappings](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/mapping-documents), we added an icon to the structure that you are mapping to, so you can easily see whether it comes from an imported web service, xml schema, json structure or message definition.
* In [published REST services](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/published-rest-service), you can now check a box called **Enable CORS** that will allow other websites to access your REST service.
* We now support the creation of MYSQL databases through the Mendix Modeler.

### Fixes

* We have fixed an issue about 'High DPI scaling' of Version Selector and removed the old splashscreen. (Ticket 50101)
* We fixed Team Server connection issues that occurred after switching account or changing your password. (Ticket 67205)
* We fixed the behavior of the 'Team Server App' drop-down so that it no longer closes when navigating with the keyboard. Also, the list of branches will not contain duplicates anymore.
* We fixed an issue that occurred when opening a project that was created online. When syncing with the Web Modeler, the Desktop Modeler would complain about there already being local changes. No more.
* When a Create button was placed on a Datagrid with a specialization configured as entity, the generalization would be instantiated instead. The button creates the correct entity again. (Ticket 67014)
* Offline file synchronization can fail because of connection issues. In such case, a situation could arise where the synchronization would not be attempted again, leading to a partial synchronization. We fixed this by first doing a temporary upload which will be discarded in case of synchronization failure. (Ticket 64456)
* When the default action on a grid on a select page was to select the item, this was not communicated properly to the corresponding reference selector. Instead, the reference would be cleared. This and a similar issue with the (input) reference set selector were fixed. (Ticket 65193)
* We fixed the issue causing the built-in admin user to retain old roles when a new role was selected in the Security configuration of the Modeler project. (Ticket 65664)
* We fixed the problem that using Microsoft Azure file storage causes configured certificates not to be used anymore in Mendix.
* We improved error handling in the interrupt request admin action. A failure when logging a log message will still attempt interruption of the thread.
* We updated our version of Microsoft Azure Storage Library from 7.0.0 to 8.0.0.
* We upgraded _xerces.xercesImpl.jar_ library to version 2.12.
* We fine-tuned the colors of microflow activities to give them more contrast. (Ticket 65699)
* We fixed an issue where the default value was inserted every time for an AutoNumber attribute having no access rights. (Ticket 63071)
* It is now possible to add variables to the `createXPathQuery` in the Core Java API. (Ticket 67019)
* We fixed an issue where sorting on the search field in the Data Grid would result in a database exception. (Ticket 64852)
* We fixed the bug in behavior of COUNT on attribute aggregate query. Previously, when a count on attribute was defined along with other aggregate functions, count was always rendered as COUNT(*). As of this release, attribute specific aggregate functions are always rendered in terms of associated attribute. As this may change the result of COUNT aggregate function in your application, a temporary custom property was introduced called _DataStorage.CountOnAttribute_. Setting this property to False will allow you to fallback to the old COUNT behaviour. 
  As of Mendix 8 we plan to remove the custom property _DataStorage.CountOnAttribute_.
* We upgraded the HSQLDB (built-in database) driver version from 2.3.4 to 2.4.1.

### Known Issues

Updates or commits to the Team Server can result in an error dialog. When doing a commit or update to the Team Server after more than 1 hour after the last Team Server connection, you will get an error dialog with the details panel showing SvnOperationCanceledException info. This can be solved by re-trying the update or commit action again. (Ticket 67051)
