The following tokens are used in XPath queries:

| Token | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `//` | A full XPath query always starts with the tokens `//`. These slashes are followed by the designation of the [object](/refguide9/entities/) that is being queried. For example, if you wish to retrieve all customers, the query would resemble the following: `//Customers`. |
| `.` | The dot is used to separate [module](/refguide9/modules/) names from [entity](/refguide9/entities/) names. For example, if you wish to retrieve all the customers (objects) in the sales module, you would start the query with `//Sales.Customer`. |
| `/` | A slash is used whenever you want to refer to a new entity or association. For example, `//Sales.Customer/Sales.Customer_Order/Sales.Order`. This query follows the path from the [entity](/refguide9/entities/) `Customer` to the entity `Order` over the [association](/refguide9/associations/) `Customer_Order`. A query can be expanded by slashes and entities or associations for as long as there are potential associations available in the domain model. |
| `[ ]` | A constraint is always written between brackets. For example, `//Sales.Customer[TotalAmount > 1000]`. The [attribute](/refguide9/attributes/) being constrained is `TotalAmount`, and the constraint is `> 1000`. Therefore, only customers who have spent more than â‚¬ 1000 will be retrieved. |
| `( )` | Constraints can be grouped by parentheses. For more information, see [XPath Constraints](/refguide9/xpath-constraints/). |

System variables are tokens whose values can be used in XPath expressions. For a complete overview of these tokens, see [XPath Keywords and System Variables](/refguide9/xpath-keywords-and-system-variables/).

It is not possible to add mathematical expressions in an XPath outside of tokens. Mathematical expressions should be calculated outside of the XPath expression.
