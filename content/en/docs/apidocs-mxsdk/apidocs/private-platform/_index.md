## 1 Introduction

The documents in this category present an overview of the [Private Mendix Platform](/private-mendix-platform/) API documentation, such as Group, User, Marketplace, and Project.

The API documentation is divided into the sections described below.

For more information, see [API (Application Programming Interface)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/api/) in the *Technology Glossary*.

## 2 Prerequisites

Authentication for the API uses a personal access token (PAT). You can generate a PAT in the **Personal Access Tokens** section of your [Private Mendix Platform Profile](/private-mendix-platform/user-guide/#profile).

Each available API has its own set of scopes that define the access level for the token. As a best practice, consider restricting the token's scope to the lowest access level required to perform the necessary operations.

Copy the `{GENERATED_PAT}` and store it in a safe location, so you can use it to authorize your Private Mendix Platform API calls.
