## 1 Introduction

The **Validation feedback** activity does a validation check, and if this check fails, it shows a red message to the end-user below the widget that displays the attribute or association which failed the validation. For example, if the customer did not verify their email, a message will be displayed that the customer should verify it before they can log in:
