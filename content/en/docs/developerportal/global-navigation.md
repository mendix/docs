## 1 Introduction

The global navigation top bar and menu work the same in the Developer Portal as they do in other browser-based parts of the Mendix Platform (for example, [Mendix Marketplace](/appstore/) and [Mendix Catalog](/catalog/)). 

The global navigation is always accessible throughout the online Mendix Platform.

## 2 Global Navigation Menu {#global-navigation}

On the left side of the top bar, click **Open Global Navigation** ({{% icon name="layout-rounded-1" color="color" %}}) to access the main menu:

Click the menu items to navigate to different parts of the Mendix Platform, or hover over the menu items to expand the sections for further access.

## 3 Search

In the **Search** box, you can search the platform for **Docs**, **Forum** posts, public **Marketplace** content, and **Academy** content.

Use the various filters to refine your search results:

## 5 Notifications Menu {#notifications}

Click **Open Notifications Menu** ({{% icon name="alarm-bell" color="color" %}}) to see the platform notifications you have received. Clicking the notification itself takes you to the source.

To configure what types of notifications you receive, click the settings button (via the gear icon) and update the options in the [Notification Settings](/community-tools/mendix-profile/#notifications) page that opens.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
To stop receiving notifications when new feedback is submitted for a specific app, go to the [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page for that app and click **Stop Watching**. To disable notifications for multiple apps on one page, use the **Stop Watching** option on the [My Apps](/developerportal/#my-apps) page.

You can also sign out from the Mendix Platform via this menu.
