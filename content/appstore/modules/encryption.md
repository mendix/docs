## 1 Introduction

The [Encryption](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/1011/) module takes care of the encryption of strings (for example, passwords) using AES.

### 1.1 Typical Usage Scenarios

The typical usage scenario is when a project/module consumes a service where a user name and password are required, you can store the password in an encrpyted way in the database. The key used for encrypting passwords is configured as a constant and remains on the application server.

### 1.2 Limitations

* Encryption using AES only

## 2 Configuration

Set the `EncryptionKey` constant located in the **Private - String en/de-cryption** folder. Make sure the key consists of 16 characters.
