## 5 Custom Domain

On this page, you can manage your custom domain certificates.

When your Mendix App needs to be accessible via your own URL (for example, `https://myapp.mycompany.com/`), you have to provide a custom domain certificate (an SSL/TLS certificate) so that we can keep serving your Mendix app via a secure connection.

There is also a section with an overview of linked custom domains.

For more information, see [How to Configure Custom Domains](/developerportal/howto/custom-domains).
