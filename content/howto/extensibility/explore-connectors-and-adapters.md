## 1 Introduction

One of the strengths of the Mendix Platform is that it is easy to connect your Mendix application with other systems. The [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/index3.html) is filled with all kinds of connectors and adapters. This document presents an overview of some of our connectors.

This document does not go into usage details for these specific connectors and adapters. For details on typical usage scenarios, installation, dependencies, and configuration, see the [App Store Guide](/appstore/index)

For documentation on using more specific connectors and adapters for Siemens, SAP, and IBM, see the [Strategic Partners Guide](/partners/index).
