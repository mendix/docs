The Mendix Platform includes the [Web Modeler](overview-wm) in addition to the [Desktop Modeler](../desktop-modeler-overview). The Web Modeler is a collaborative, no-code, web-based application development environment.

The Web Modeler enables you to do the following: 

* Develop application user interfaces with styled building blocks and widgets
* Create domain models for reading and writing data in an application
* Visually model the interactions and flow control of an application
