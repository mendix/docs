## 1 Introduction

An end event defines where the flow will stop. 

An end event can return a value: an object, enumeration, a list, etc. For more information, see the [Return Value](#return-value) section. 

In the example below, a *Buyer* variable of the *Customer* entity is returned by the end event:

The number of end events depends on the number of possible outcomes of the microflow or a nanoflow. That means there can be more than one end event, for example when a [decision](/refguide/decision/) is used:

## 2 Behavior Properties

### 2.1 Return Value {#return-value}

The return value is the value that is returned to the flow that called the current flow. If you have several end events and they have a return value, they all need to return a value of the same type. For example, if one of the end events returns an object of type *Entity*, the others need to return the same type: 

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/microflows-and-nanoflows/events/end-event/return-value.png"   width="300px"  >}}

You can choose to return nothing, or to return, for example, a list, enumeration, or Boolean value:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/microflows-and-nanoflows/events/end-event/end-event-type.png" width="500px" >}}

The return value can be entered as an [expression](/refguide/expressions/).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you are calling a microflow from another microflow, note that a *calling* microflow cannot control what is returned. It is controlled by the *called* microflow. 
{{% /alert %}}
