You can export the structure of your test case by pressing **PDF**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/rg-ats/rg-one-ats/rg-one-test-dev/rg-one-test-case-documentation/exportbutton.png" alt="PDF export button" >}}

This will generate a detailed test case documentation with all the test steps in order along with their input values.

The generated PDF document will look similar to this:
