## 1 Introduction 

In this document, we explain how to solve the most common consistency errors that can occur when configuring microflows in Mendix Studio. For more information on microflows, see [Microflows](/studio/microflows/).

An example of a consistency error is when you set a drag and drop a **Create Object** activity to the microflow, but do not specify what entity should be used as a data source to create the object.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This document does not describe all the errors, as there are a lot of errors that can occur, some of which are simple and do not need extra explanation, others are rare and/or heavily dependent on a use-case.

Some errors have error codes and if these errors are described in documentation, Studio has a clickable link to the corresponding document. Others do not have an error code, in this case, you can manually search whether a particular error is described in documentation (you can search by a message you see in the **Checks** panel).


## 2 Properties Not Set Consistency Errors {#properties-not-set}

Many errors occur if you do not set properties (for example, a data source) for an element or an activity. The most common errors of this type are described in the table below:

| Error Code | Text in the Checks Panel                                     | Element/ Activity                                            | Cause of an Error                                            | Way to Fix                                                   |

## 3 Properties Set Incorrectly Consistency Errors {#properties-set-incorrectly}

If you have not configured properties of an element or an activity correctly, you will get consistency errors. For example, you have set an attribute of the integer type for an decision, when only Boolean and enumeration types are allowed for it. 

The most common errors of this type are described in the table below. 

| Error Code | Text in the Checks Panel                                     | Element/ Activity                                            | Cause of an Error                                            | Way to Fix                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CE0078     | Condition should be of type Boolean or enumeration but is of type {type of condition}. | [Decision](/studio/microflows-decision/) and [Decision in workflows](/studio/workflows-general-activities/#decision) | You have configured an invalid condition expression in the decision properties. The condition expression should return a Boolean or an enumeration. | Expression should return a Boolean or an enumeration: open the decision properties > **Data Source** > **Condition**, and select a variable or an attribute of Boolean or enumeration type. |
|            | Value must be of type {type of value}.                       | [Decision](/studio/microflows-decision/)                     | You have configured a condition for the decision which does not result in a Boolean or enumeration, so the selected split condition is invalid. | Open the decision properties > **Data Source** > **Condition** and configure a condition that results in a Boolean or enumeration. |
| CE0108     | Variable {variable name} is defined but not in scope at this location. | Change Variable                                              | You have added a **Change Variable** activity to the microflow before an activity that creates this variable. | Change the order of the activities in the microflow placing the activity that creates a variable first. Only after that you will be able to change it: add a **Create Variable** activity before **Change Variable**. |
| CE0109     | Undefined variable {variable name}                           | Create Variable/ Change Variable                             | A variable that is not available anymore is used in the microflow. You have deleted an activity that provided the variable. **Parameter**, **Create Object**, or **Create Variable** can provide variables for the microflow, and that variable was used for **Create Variable** or **Change Variable** activities. | Add an activity that will provide the microflow with a variable that is missing, or select another variable for the **Create Variable**/ **Change Variable** activity in properties. |
| CE0161     | Error(s) in the filter conditions. Open 'Filter' of the Retrieve action and check the marked conditions | A filter of a Retrieve action                                | A filter condition is no longer valid.                       | Open properties of the **Retrieve** activity > **Filter** and check the conditions that are marked in red. |
| CE1827     | Object should be of type {object type} or a specialization of it. | Call Workflow action                                         | This action requires you to pass an object of the same type that is configured for the [Workflow Context parameter](/studio/workflow-parameter/). You have selected an object of a different entity for the microflow parameter or the **Create Object** activity. | Open the parameter or the **Create Object** activity properties and select the object of the same entity that is configured for the [Workflow Context parameter](/studio/workflow-parameter/). |
| CE1831     | All 'Complete task' actions should have an outcome selected from the same user task. | Complete task action                                         | You have selected different user tasks for **Complete Task** actions in your microflow. | Select the same user task for all Complete Tasks actions in your microflow. To do so, navigate to Complete Task properties > **Task**. |

## 4 Errors Connected with Studio Pro Settings

Some consistency errors may be connected with settings in Mendix Studio Pro. The most common errors of this type are described in the table below. 

| Error Code | Text in the Checks Panel                                     | Element/ Activity | Cause of an Error                                            | Way to Fix                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|            | The selected microflow {name of the microflow} no longer exists. | Microflow         | You have deleted a microflow that is selected in Studio Pro > **App Settings** > **Runtime** > **After startup** or **Before shutdown** options. For more information on **After startup** /**Before shutdown** microflows, see the [After-Startup and Before-Shutdown Microflows](/refguide/clustered-mendix-runtime/#startup-shutdown-microflows) section in Clustered Mendix Runtime in the *Runtime category*. | There two ways to fix the error: <ul><li>In Studio: create a microflow with the same name</li><li>In Studio Pro: open **App** > **Settings**, in the **App Settings** pop-up dialog  open the **Runtime** tab and either select a different microflow for **After startup** / **Before shutdown** options, or set these options to **None**.</li></ul> |
| CE0142     | After startup microflow should return a Boolean.             | Microflow         | This microflow is selected in Studio Pro > **App Settings** > **Runtime** > **After startup** or **Before shutdown** options, and should return a Boolean. For more information on **After startup** /**Before shutdown** microflows, see the [After-Startup and Before-Shutdown Microflows](/refguide/clustered-mendix-runtime/#startup-shutdown-microflows) section in *Clustered Mendix Runtime*. | Open the properties of the microflow's end event > the **Return Value** section, select **Value** option > set **Data Type** to Boolean and configure the **Value**. |
