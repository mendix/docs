These release notes cover changes to the [Mendix Profile, Mendix Community, and other Mendix community tools](/community-tools/).

## 2024

### June 28, 2024

#### New Features

* We released two AI-powered features in the [Mendix Community](/community-tools/mendix-community/): Maia (Mendix AI Assistance) Summarize and Maia Rewrite:
    * Maia Summarize condenses lengthy discussions for a question into key points, making it easier for you to find solutions to your questions without having to plough through every single answer in the thread.
    * Maia Rewrite is an assisted writing aid integrated within the Mendix Community posting interface, which helps you to ask properly-formatted questions that are more likely to be answered.

### February 8, 2024

#### New Features

* Deactivating and resetting your two-factor authentication (2FA) is now self-service. If you want to deactivate your 2FA, you can do this in your Developer Settings; previously, deactivating your 2FA required submitting a Mendix Support ticket. Deactivating your 2FA is the first step if you want to change your 2FA method, phone number, or authenticator app. For more information, see [Changing Your Authentication Method](/developerportal/deploy/two-factor-authentication/#change-2fa-method).

### January 29, 2024

#### Improvements

* We are excited to announce that the Mendix Forum has grown into something much more than just a forum. As a result, we have decided to give it a new name: welcome to the [Mendix Community](/community-tools/mendix-community/)!

## 2023

### October 26, 2023

#### Improvements

* In Academy, we now have a new user-friendly experience for taking the [Mendix Rapid Developer Exam](https://academy.mendix.com/link/rapiddeveloper).

### June 29, 2023

#### New Features

* We introduced a Mendix Profile recovery email address option that allows you to prove ownership of a profile during the profile merge process. You can provide a non-business email address for this.

#### Improvements

* We changed the process for merging Mendix Profiles so that the profiles are truly merged and your user accounts stay connected to the resulting Mendix Profile. Previously, profile data was moved from one account to another.

### March 30, 2023

#### New Features  {#spaces-ga-release}

* We releases Spaces in the Mendix Forum  for GA.

### March 23, 2023

#### Improvements

### February 13, 2023 {#feb-13-23}

#### Improvements

* We moved the notification settings you set for your app management to **Account Settings** > [Notifications](/community-tools/mendix-profile/user-settings/#notifications) (which you can access via the menu beneath your avatar in the top bar). This page includes a list of the apps you are watching.
* In addition, personal **API Keys** are available via **Account Settings** > [Developer Settings](/community-tools/mendix-profile/user-settings/#dev-settings).

## 2022

### August 22, 2022

#### New Features

* We have changed the password reset flow:
    * You can no longer update your password from your Mendix Profile.
    * All password resets and changes are now done via the [New Password Request page](https://login.mendix.com/mxid3/request-password-reset), which you can reach using the **Forgot password?** link on the login screen. This will send a password reset link to your registered email address.

### August 9, 2022

#### New Features

* We released [Notifications](/developerportal/global-navigation/#notifications) for beta usage, which allows you to receive updates from Academy, Data Hub, Developer Portal, Epics, and Forum. Additionally, you can manage what kind of updates you will receive in the [Notification Settings](https://user-settings.mendix.com/link/notifications) page.

### July 14, 2022

#### Improvements

## 2021

### December 23, 2021
