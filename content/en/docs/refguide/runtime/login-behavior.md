## 1 Default Login Behavior

A user is blocked after 3 consecutive bad login attempts, regardless of the time between the login attempts. The failed login count is reset after a successful login attempt or when a blocked user is unblocked. Blocking users only occurs when the app security level is set to **Production**.

Users are unblocked each time the cluster manager runs, and at that point, the failed login count is also reset to 0. By default, the cluster manager runs every 5 minutes. This interval can be changed using the [Runtime customization](/refguide/custom-settings/) `ClusterManagerActionInterval` setting.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The cluster manager does more than just unblocking users. For example, it also removes expired sessions. So, changing this interval has a broader impact.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If a user is blocked just 1 second before the cluster manager starts to unblock all blocked users, the lock is removed after 1 second.
{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Customizing Login Behavior

Login behavior can be customized by implementing a custom Java action and registering it to be used instead of the default login action.

Cluster manager behavior currently cannot be changed.
