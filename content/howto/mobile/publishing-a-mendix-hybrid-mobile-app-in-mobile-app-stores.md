## 1 Introduction

Once you have finished developing a Mendix hybrid mobile application, you will want to make it available as an app for mobile platforms such as Apple iOS and Google Android. We make it possible to produce platform-specific installation packages. For more details on deploying platform-specific installation packages, see [Mobile App](/developerportal/deploy/mobileapp).

The hybrid mobile app packaging process is based on Adobe PhoneGap. We have integrated the [Adobe PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/) service into Mendix to provide support for automatically building the required hybrid mobile packages. Instead of worrying about technical details, you can focus on what matters most: rapidly developing an app to support your business processes.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up app signing keys
* Complete the app-packaging process
* Install an iOS or Android app on a mobile test device
* Upload your app to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Have a Mendix app with mobile support running in the Mendix Cloud, either as a Free App or on a licensed cloud node
	* If you require an app to test with, set up the [Event App](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/36793/) from the Mendix App Store as a Free App to try out its mobile features 
* Have an account for Adobe PhoneGap Build (you can create one for free [here](https://build.phonegap.com/plans/free-adobeid))

To publish your app in the Apple App Store, do the following:

* Register for an [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/register/index.action)
* Have an iOS device (iPhone or iPad) for testing the iOS package that will be produced
* Have an iOS deployment certificate and a provisioning file for which your mobile test device is activated
* Have Apple iTunes installed on your computer for deploying the iOS package that will be produced on your mobile test device

To publish your app in the Google Play store, do the following:

* Have an Android device for testing the APK package that will be produced

## 4 Starting the Packaging Process{#starting-the-packaging-process}

To start the packaging process, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/).

2. Go to the project of the Mendix app that you want to publish.

3. Go to the **Deploy > Mobile app** entry in the side menu of the project.

4. You will be shown the **Publish App for Mobile App Stores** page, where you need to set up some options for your hybrid mobile app.

   ![mobile app page](attachments/publishing-a-hybrid-app/mobile-app-page.png)

5. On the **App Info** tab set up the following settings for your app:</br>
   a. Fill in the name that your app will have in the app stores and on the device. The **Name** should correspond to the name set up in your Apple certificate.</br>
   b. Set the unique **App Identifier** for your app. The **App Identifier** should correspond to the ones set up in your Apple certificate.</br>
   c. If your app does not employ push notifications, disable the **Push Notifications** permission by clearing its check box.

6. Select the platforms that you want to support.

7. Optionally, upload custom-branded app icons and splash screens under the tabs for the different platforms. You can find those tabs next to the **App Info** tab.

{{% alert type="info" %}}If you do not upload any images, the default Mendix-branded images that are shown will continue to be used.{{% /alert %}}

8. Click the green **Publish for Mobile App Stores** button. You will be presented with the **Build Mobile App Store Packages** page:

![build mobile app store packages](attachments/publishing-a-hybrid-app/build-mobile-packages.png)

9. Select where you want to publish:

	* For Free Apps, the only option is **Sandbox**
	* For apps running on a licensed cloud node, you can choose from **Test**, **Acceptance**, and **Production** (depending on what is available on your cloud node)
	* For apps using [Flexible Environments](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy#flexible-environments) you will be able to select the environment from a drop-down list of environments.
	
10. Leave the default choice of how to build the package **Build Mobile App Store packages for me by sending the build configuration to Adobe PhoneGap Build** selected. 
	You can use the alternative option to manually download a PhoneGap Build package, which you can then inspect, modify, and upload manually to Adobe PhoneGap Build (for more information, see [Customizing PhoneGap Build Packages](/refguide/customizing-phonegap-build-packages)). This is unnecessary in most scenarios.
11. Before proceeding, you must link your PhoneGap account to your Mendix account. Start the hybrid mobile app package building process by clicking **Start PhoneGap Build job**, which will initiate the building process:

	![phonegap authorization](attachments/publishing-a-hybrid-app/phonegap-authorization-dialog.png)

12. The first time you start this process, you will need to authorize the Mendix Developer Portal to act on your behalf with the Adobe PhoneGap Build service. In PhoneGap Build, you will be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to start the redirect to Adobe PhoneGap. <br/>
	a. To build for the authorization, click **Authorize use of Adobe PhoneGap Build**, after which you will be temporarily redirected to the website of your Adobe PhoneGap Build. <br/>
13. Choose **Yes** on the Adobe PhoneGap Build service page to allow the start of building jobs using your account. You will then be redirected back to the Mendix Developer Portal.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}If you choose **No**, you will be redirected back to the Developer Portal and you will not be able to publish your app.{{% /alert %}}

After you have been redirected back to the Mendix Developer Portal, the packaging process will continue and you will have to set up your app's signing keys.

## 5 Setting Up App Signing Keys

The **PhoneGap Build: Signing Key Required** page asks you to go to the PhoneGap Build website and set up the app signing keys. To set up the app signing keys, follow these steps:

1. Click **Log in to PhoneGap Build**. A new page will be opened on PhoneGap's [apps tab](https://build.phonegap.com/apps). Here you can see the PhoneGap Build app that was created by the Mendix Developer Portal for your app. The app is named as you defined it in the **App Info** in the [Starting the Packaging Process](#starting-the-packaging-process) section above.
2. Set up the app signing key for your app in your account.
3.  Click the avatar icon at the top-right of the page, and then click **Edit account** to configure how your app will build:
