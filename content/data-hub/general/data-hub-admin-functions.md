## 2 Adding a Curator {#curator}

The Data Hub Curator curates registered assets in the Data Hub Catalog to enrich the information on registered assets and maintain assets. 

Curators can see and curate all registered assets in the Data Hub Catalog, including the ones that are set to **Non-discoverable** by service owners. 

The Data Hub Admin can assign users to a Curator role by following these steps:

1. From **Data Hub** screen, click the **Data Hub Admin** tab.
2. The **Data Hub Admin** page will display the list of curators for the organisation.
3. To add assign the curator role to a user, click **Add Curator**.
4. From the list of users, check the user(s) that should have the curator role.
