## 1 Introduction

An image uploader is used to upload images to the server. It also generates a thumbnail of the uploaded image. The uploaded image or its thumbnail can be displayed by a dynamic image. It must be placed inside a data view connected to the entity System.Image or a specialization thereof.

In the example below, an image uploader is placed in a nested data view (the *Profile* entity is a specialization of System.Image):
