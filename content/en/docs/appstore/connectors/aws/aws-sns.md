## 1 Introduction
 
The [Amazon SNS connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/204715) provides a way for you to enrich your Mendix app with app-to-app and app-to-person notifications by implementing [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).
 
### 1.1 Typical Use Cases
 
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) can send app-to-app (A2A) and app-to-person (A2P) notifications. The A2A functionality provides high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. These applications include Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Lambda, and other HTTPS endpoints. The A2P functionality lets you send messages to your customers with SMS, push notifications, and email.
 
### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
 
The Amazon SNS connector requires Mendix Studio Pro version 9.18.0 or above.
 
To authenticate with Amazon Web Service (AWS), you must also install and configure the [AWS authentication connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333). For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).
 
{{% alert color="info" %}}
Ensure that the AWS user account used for authentication has the appropriate permissions to access the SNS service in AWS.

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Installation
 
Follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/) to import the Amazon SNS connector into your app.
 
## 3 Configuration
 
After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonSNSConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon SNS. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.
 
### 3.1 Configuring AWS Authentication
 
In order to use the Amazon SNS service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.
 
1. Ensure that you have installed and configured the AWS Authentication connector, as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. Decide whether you want to use session or static credentials to authenticate.

    The Amazon SNS connector supports both session and static credentials. By default, the connector is pre-configured to use static credentials, but you may want to switch to session credentials, for example, to increase the security of your app. For an overview of both authentication methods, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).

3. In the **App Explorer**, double-click the **Settings** for your app.
 
    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-sns/appsettings.png" alt="The Settings option in the App Explorer">}}
 
4. In the **App Settings** dialog, in the **Configurations** tab, edit or create an authentication profile.

    If you have multiple sets of AWS credentials, or if you want to use both static and session credentials for different use cases, create separate authentication profiles for each set of credentials.

5. In the **Edit Configuration** dialog, in the **Constants** tab, click **New** to add the constants required for the configuration.
6. In the **Select Constants** dialog, find and expand the **AmazonSNSConnector** > **ConnectionDetails** section.
 
    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-sns/credentials.png" alt="The SessionCredentials and StaticCredentials items in the ConnectionDetails section">}}
 
7. Depending on your selected authentication type, configure the required parameters for the **StaticCredentials** or **SessionCredentials**.
 
 | Credentials type | Constant | Value |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | Any | **UseStaticCredentials** | **true** if you want to use static credentials, or **false** for session credentials |
 | **StaticCredentials** | **AccessKey** | Access key ID [created in IAM](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
 | **StaticCredentials** | **SecretKey** | Secret key [created in IAM](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
 | **SessionCredentials** | **Role ARN** | [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the AWS role that the connector should assume |
 | **SessionCredentials** | **Profile ARN** | ARN of the profile [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
 | **SessionCredentials** | **Trust Anchor ARN** | ARN of the trust anchor [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
 | **SessionCredentials** | **Client Certificate Identifier** | The **Client Certificate Pin** visible in the **Outgoing Certificates** section on the **Network** tab in the Mendix Cloud environment |
 | **SessionCredentials** | **Duration** | Duration for which the session token should be valid; after the duration passes, the validity of the session credentials expires |
 | **SessionCredentials** | **Session Name** | An identifier for the session |
 
### 3.2 Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After you configure the authentication profile for Amazon SNS, you can implement the functions of the connector by using the provided activities in microflows.

#### 3.2.1 Subscribing to a Topic

To subscribe to a topic in your AWS environment and receive email notifications from it, implement the [Subscribe](#subscribe) activity by performing the following steps:

1. In the **App Explorer**, right-click the name of your module, and then click **Add microflow**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-sns/sns_create_microflow.png" alt="Adding a microflow">}}

2. Enter a name for your microflow, for example, *ACT_Subscribe_Email*, and then click **OK**.
3. In the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonSNSConnector** section, find the **Subscribe** activity.
4. Drag the **Subscribe** activity onto the microflow you are working on.
5. Double-click the **Subscribe** activity and configure the **AWS_Region** parameter by doing the following steps:

    1. Click **Edit parameter value**, edit the **AWS_Region** parameter, and change **Type** to **Expression**.
    2. In the expression builder, type `AWS_Region`, and then press **Ctrl+Space**.
    3. In the autocomplete dialog, select **AmazonSNSConnector.AWS_Region**, then type *.* and select your AWS region from the list.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-sns/sns_subscribe_aws_region.png" alt="Selecting the AWS region">}}

6. In the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonSNSConnector** > **ConnectionDetails** section, find the **Credentials_GenerateFromConstants** activity.
7. Drag the **Credentials_GenerateFromConstants** activity onto the microflow you are working on, and position it between the microflow start event and the **Subscribe** activity.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-sns/sns_subscribe_actions.png" alt="Configuring the Subscribe activity">}}

8. Double-click the **Credentials_GenerateFromConstants** activity, and then configure the required **AWS_Region** parameter in the same way as described in step 5.
9. Double-click the **Subscribe** activity and configure the **Credentials** parameter by doing the following steps:
    1. Click **Edit parameter value**.
    2. Edit the **Credentials** parameter and let it auto-fill.
10. Double-click the **Subscribe** activity and configure the **SubscribeRequest** parameter by doing the following steps:

### 4.3 Activities {#activities}
 
Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow. For the Amazon SNS connector, they represent actions such as creating or deleting a topic in Amazon SNS.

#### 4.3.1 ConfirmSubscription{#confirmsubscription}
 
To activate the sending of messages to a subscription for a URL endpoint, the subscription first has to be confirmed. The confirmation needs the short-lived token that has been sent to the URL of the endpoint via an HTTP-POST request (and can be found in the request body). For more information, see [Subscribing an HTTP/S endpoint to a topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-subscribe-https-s-endpoints-to-topic.html).
 
The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:
 
| Input | Output |

| `ConfirmSubscriptionRequest(Object)` | |
| `Credentials (Object)` | |

#### 4.3.2 CreateTopic {#create-topic}
 
The `CreateTopic` Amazon SNS action allows you to create a new topic. It requires a valid AWS Region and a `CreateTopicRequest`. The `CreateTopicRequest` must contain a topic name, and can contain attributes and tags. The output is a `CreateTopicResponse` that contains the newly created topics ARN. If a topic with the given name already exists, no error is thrown and a CreateTopicResponse with the already existing topic's ARN is returned.

#### 4.3.3 ListTopics {#list-topics}
 
The `ListTopics` Amazon SNS action allows you to retrieve a list of all Topics for a given Amazon SNS environment. It requires a valid AWS Region. The action returns a `ListTopicsResponse` object which contains a list of Topic objects.

The ListTopicRequest input parameter can be set to `empty`. If this is the case, the first 100 objects will be retrieved.
 
The request will return at most 100 topics. Pass the nextToken attribute onto a new request to retrieve the next set of topics

#### 4.3.4 PublishBatch {#publish-batch}
 
The `Publish` Amazon SNS action allows you to publish up to 10 messages to all those subscribed to a given topic.  It requires a valid AWS Region and a PublishRequest object, containing a Topic object that can contain up to 10 message objects. The output of the action is a `PublishBatchResponse` object containing information on whether or not the messages was successfully delivered to the SNS topic.
 
The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:
 
| Input | Output |

| `AWS_Region (Enumeration)` | `PublishBatchResponse` |
| `PublishRequest (Object)` | 
| `Credentials (Object)` | |

#### 4.3.5 Subscribe {#subscribe}
 
To receive messages published to a topic, you must subscribe an endpoint to the topic. When you subscribe an endpoint to a topic, the endpoint begins to receive messages published to the associated topic. The supported endpoint types are email, json-email, SMS, and URL.

Before messages are sent, the subscription might have to be confirmed. For email-type endpoints, this requires the end-user to click the confirmation link in an email. For URL-type endpoints, a short-lived token is sent to the endpoint. This token has to be used in the `ConfirmSubscription` action. For more information, see [Subscribing to an Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html).

A Filter Policy can also be set on a subscription to filter on the messages the subscription will receive. For more information, see [Amazon SNS message filtering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-filtering.html) and [Filter policy constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/subscription-filter-policy-constraints.html).
