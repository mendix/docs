## 1 Introduction

In this how-to, you will create and prepare a new project, module, and domain model. This is the first how-to in the series for creating a to-do app in 20 minutes using the Mendix Mobile Quick Starter app.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a project that will speed up and simplify your mobile app development

## 2 Prerequisites

3. On the **Tutorial Apps** tab, select **Build a Mobile ToDo app**.
4. Click **Use this app**, enter a name for your application, and click **Create App**.
5. On the **Buzz** page for the app, click **Edit App**, which will open your app in the Desktop Modeler.
6. When your app is loaded into the Desktop Modeler, open **Project** > **Security** to update the security settings of your app project.
7.  Switch the **Security level** to **Off** and click **OK**.

    Switching the security level to **Off** is done for fast development. Make sure you change it back to **Production** and configure the security of your app when you are going to use the app in a production environment!

## 4 Creating a New Module

The development of your app stays comprehensible when its functionality is split into separate modules.
Follow these steps to create a new module where you can add the to-do implementation of your app:

1. Right-click your **ProjectName** in the Project Explorer.
2. Click **Add module** and give it the name **ToDo**.

## 5 Creating the Domain Model

The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way.

The domain model for the to-do app will be pretty simple. It'll contain one entity with three attributes. Follow these steps to create the entity and attributes:

1. Open the **Domain Model** in the **ToDo** module.
2. Add a new **Entity** to the Domain Model.
2. Rename the entity to **ToDo**.
3.  Add the following three attributes:
    * *Description* (String)
    * *DueDate* (Date and time)
    * *Completed* (Boolean with default value *False*)
