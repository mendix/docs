Building hybrid apps in the cloud uses the PhoneGap Build service from Adobe. Unfortunately, Adobe no longer maintains this service. PhoneGap does not allow you to create  iOS 13 builds, but the Apple App Store requires builds be iOS 13 or higher. As a result, as of April 30th 2020, hybrid iOS apps built using the PhoneGap Build service are not being accepted on Apple's App Store. To publish your iOS app in the Apple App Store, we recommend you build native iOS apps instead. For more information, see [How to Build Native Apps](/howto8/mobile/build-native-apps/).
