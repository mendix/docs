This page describes how we handle feature requests. In general, we process **all** feature requests through the Idea Forum. The one exception is when the implementation of your requested feature is already committed by our Sales and/or Customer Success Management teams, and approved by our product managers. In that case you should use our support portal.

Using the Idea Forum we collect all the ideas from our community on a quarterly basis. Together with the MVPs these ideas will be prioritized, and every quarter the top ideas will be added to the platform.

## Add an idea

Make sure you search the Idea Forum for your idea before submitting a new idea. There may be someone else who posted the same idea! Add a new idea using the following steps: 

1.  Go to **[The Mendix forum](http://forum.mendix.com)**.
2.  Go to the **Ideas** tab.
3. Click **Submit idea**.
4. Explain as clearly as possible what your idea is, and what its benefit would be once implemented.


## Upvotes

All the ideas will be publicly visible. By upvoting ideas you can show the community and our product management what you would like to see added to the Mendix platform. The upvotes will be used as input for the MVPs and our Product Management Team to decide which features will be nominated for implementation.

## Prioritization

All the ideas will be groomed by our Product Managers using t-shirt sizing to give insight into the impact of their implementation. Our group of MVPs will finally prioritize the feature requests and present their advice to our Product Management Team. In this process of prioritization our MVPs will look at the combination of upvotes, feature value in projects, implementation impact, and a good distribution on modeler time saving features and features connected to our roadmap.

## Implementation and communication

The Product Management Team (PMT) will finally decide which features will be implemented and when. The process of prioritization and deciding which feature will be implemented will be done during the quarter of the new open IdeaForum topic. With closing the new topic, the PMT will communicate which features of the IdeaForum topic of the quarter will be implemented. So the feature requests of Q1 will be prioritized during Q2, and with closing the Q2 IdeaForum the PMT will communicate which features of the Q1 IdeaForum will be implemented in Q3, and so on.

# Feature request in Support Portal

As described in the first paragraph, feature requests that are already approved by our Product Management Team need to be processed through our support portal so that we can track progress related to the committed appointment between our R&D department and you / the customer.

## Implementation

The communication will be done through the Support Portal. Our Customer Success Management will be responsible of the communication of the progress to our clients.
