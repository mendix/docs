## 1 Introduction

In the **Help** menu, you can ask questions and find answers to common problems you may experience while using Studio Pro. 

## 2 Menu Items Overview

The **Help** menu items are described in the table below:

| Menu Item (Shortcut Key)    | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Help** (<kbd>F1</kbd>)    | Opens the documentation page about the currently selected element. If an entity is selected, for example, the documentation for entities will be shown. |
| **Help Contents**           | Opens the home page of the documentation in the default web browser. |
| **Ask a Question**          | Opens the Mendix Community in the default web browser.       |
| **Support Tools**           | Provides tools that can be used to share with Mendix Support, especially when you encounter issues with performance or high memory consumption. Support tools include the following:<br> <ul><li>[Performance Logging](/refguide/performance-logging/) – logs performance measurements to key functionalities (such as opening and closing microflow editors and moving items around in the App Explorer) that can help identify performance degradations.</li> <li>[Profiling](/refguide/profiling/) – runs a performance profiler session from within Studio Pro without installing the actual profiler on your machine. This session generates a report written to disk, which you can then send to the Mendix Support teams. </li> <li>**Optimize MPR** – starts an action that will clean up a project file (.mpr) from no longer required allocated memory resources.</li></ul> |
| **Open Log File Directory** | Opens the log files written by Studio Pro that can be used to see what might be the reason something went wrong in Studio Pro. Log files can also be used to share with Mendix Support when you submit a ticket. |
| **About Mendix Studio Pro** | Shows information about the current version of Mendix Studio Pro. |
