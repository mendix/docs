## Web service Description

### WSDL

You can load the WSDL from an URL or from a WSDL file saved on your harddisk. After selecting an option and adding the required url or file location, press import to fetch the services/operations in this WSDL.

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

Starting from Modeler version 5.9, a dialog will ask for a username and password if you try to load a WSDL file from a URL that requires authentication.

{% endmarkdown %}</div><div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

A WSDL file can contain multiple services. A service can contain multiple ports. Starting from Modeler version 5.18.0, upon loading a WSDL, a dialog will ask you to select a port for each service if a service contains multiple ports.

If there is a multiple-port service defined in the WSDL, a dialog will pop up that allows the user to select which one of the ports to use _(Added in 5.10)._
