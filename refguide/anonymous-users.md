### Allow anonymous users

Here you can configure whether anonymous users are allowed to access your application.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | Anonymous users are allowed. End-users do not have to sign in to access the application. If the user clicks a button of which the microflow requires a user role other than the anonymous user role, the user is presented with a sign in screen. |
| No | Anonymous users are not allowed. End-users have to sign in to access the application. |

### Anonymous user role

This is the user role that end-users of your application have when they are not signed in.

### Sign-in microflow

When anonymous users are allowed, here you can optionally configure a sign-in microflow. This microflow can be used to transfer data from the anonymous user to the signed-in user. In this microflow the current user is set to the signed-in user.

The sign-in microflow has two parameters.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AnonymousUser | Object of entity 'System.User' | The 'User' object of the anonymous user. This object will be automatically deleted after the execution of the sign-in microflow. |
| SignedInUser | Object of entity 'System.User' | The 'User' object of the signed-in user. |

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

Clean up objects that were attached to the anonymous user and that you do _not_ transfer to the signed-in user. Since the anonymous user is deleted after running the sign-in microflow, you can use [delete behavior](associations) to automatically clean objects that were attached to the anonymous user.

The sign-in microflow is executed when an end-user:

1.  Uses your application without signing in (thus as an anonymous user), and then
2.  clicks a button for which she does not have access, which causes a sign-in screen to appear, and then
3.  signs in to your application.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

An anonymous user in a web shop adds some items to her shopping cart and then clicks the 'Check out' button. A sign-in screen appears, and the user signs in. The sign-in microflow is executed and transfers the shopping cart of the anonymous user to the signed-in user.
