The following data source properties must be configured:

* **URL(prefix)** – the URL to redirect to (for example, `http://www.mendix.com`)
* **URL Attribute** – the attribute containing a URL value to redirect to (for example, ` http://www.mendix.com`; you can also combine with the prefix value and add a value to it like `/learn`)
* **Target** – the window where the redirect URL should be opened
