## 1 Introduction

The **Branch Line Manager** is used to manage the [branch lines](/refguide/version-control/#branches) of an app that are stored on a version control server. You can create or delete branch lines for your app, and you can change the branch line that you are working on.

To view the **Branch Line Manager** dialog box, open **Version Control** > **Manage Branch Lines**.

A branch line allows independent development from other development lines. There are two main reasons for creating a branch line:

* To do maintenance development on a version of your app that is running in production. You can keep on developing in the main line while you fix issues in the branch line.
* To start the development of a very large feature that will take more than a day to develop. By doing this in a branch line, you can commit the half-implemented feature (possibly even with errors) without disturbing other development in the main line.

To switch to a branch line you have created, either double-click the branch you want to open or select the branch and click **Switch branch**.

## 2 Location

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
This option is only available when support for private Git servers is enabled in [Preferences](/refguide/preferences-dialog/).
{{% /alert %}}

Use this setting to select the location where your app is stored. This can be either the [Team Server](#team-server-app) or a [private Git repository](#byo-server-app).

### 2.1 Team Server App {#team-server-app}

Select the Team Server Git app for which you want to manage the branch lines. If you have an app open in Studio Pro, it will be selected automatically. However, you can also manage branch lines without opening an app first, in which case no app will be selected.

For more information about the Mendix Team Server, see [Team Server](/developerportal/general/team-server/).

### 2.2 Bring Your Own (BYO) Git Server App {#byo-server-app}

In the **App repository address** field, enter the address of the app you want to manage and click **Connect** to load the available branches from the repository.
