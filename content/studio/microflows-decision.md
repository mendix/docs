## 1 Introduction 

This document describes a **Decision** in Mendix Studio. 

A decision is an element based on a condition; it follows one and only one of the outgoing flows. For example, you need to use a decision to show different order forms for the customers with different grades, or to prevent a blocked customer from making orders.

## 2 Condition {#condition}

There are two ways to configure a condition for the decision:

* [With **Variables/ Attributes**](#variables-attributes-tab) ( for example, you can use it to create different flows for an attribute of the enumeration type)
*  [With an **Expression**](#expression-tab) (for example, you can create a comparison with it)

### 2.1 Configuring the Condition with Variables or Attributes {#variables-attributes-tab}

The following elements can be used as a decision condition in the **Variable/Attributes** tab:

* Variable with Boolean data type
* Variable with enumeration data type
* Attribute  of Boolean type
* Attribute of enumeration type

{{% alert type="info" %}}

The parameters and entities which you would like to use in configuring the condition of the decision should be present in the microflow, either as input parameter or as a result of an activity. 

{{% /alert %}}

### 2.2 Configuring the Condition with an Expression {#expression-tab}

You can also configure the condition by writing the expression. For more information on how to write an expression, see [Microflow Expressions](microflows-expressions).

## 3 Cases

**Cases** define the number of outgoing flows and depend on the selected [Condition](#condition). 

For the Boolean type of the parameter or attribute, two flows are possible: **true** and **false**.

The number of cases available for the enumeration type depends on the corresponding enumeration values. There is also the *empty* case available for enumeration: if the enumeration parameter or an attribute of an object is unassigned, the sequence flow with the caption **(empty)** is followed.

For example, if a end-user needs to select a customer grade but does not do that, the flow labelled **(empty)** is followed and an error message is shown to the end-user:
