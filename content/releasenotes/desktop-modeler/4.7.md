## 4.7.0

### Known Issue

There are known issues with version 4.7.0 of the Mendix Business Modeler.
When selecting elements in the Modeler, the 'None' button would have no effect.
When retrieving one attribute value or an aggregated attribute value via an XPath query or an aggregate list activity in a microflow, using the same reference in more than one constraint, the id column will be retrieved instead of the specified attribute. This leads to incorrect results.
Both issues have been solved in Mendix 4.7.1.
There is a known issue since version 4.5.1 of the Mendix Business Modeler. When retrieving one attribute value or an aggregated attribute value via an XPath query or an aggregate list activity in a microflow, using the same reference in more than one constraint, the id column will be retrieved instead of the specified attribute. This leads to incorrect results. This issue has been solved in 4.7.1.
