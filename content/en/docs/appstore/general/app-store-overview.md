## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/) is a vibrant marketplace containing complete sample apps that can be used right away as well as various components (connectors, widgets, and modules) that can be used to build custom apps more quickly. In the Mendix Marketplace, you can browse all the content, get what you need, and share the content you have created.

This document describes the different sections of the Mendix Marketplace.

## 2 Marketplace Home Page {#home}

The home page is your entry point to the various parts of the Mendix Marketplace. Here you can perform actions such as the following:

* Click **My Marketplace** to go to pages presenting your [Marketplace activity](#my-marketplace) as well as your company's [private content](#company-content)
* Click **Get Studio Pro** to get the latest version of [Studio Pro](/releasenotes/studio-pro/)
* Click **Add Content** to [share new Marketplace content](/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/) you have developed
* Explore various [industry solutions](#industry) and[content types](#types).

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/app-store-overview/home-page.png" >}}

<a id="types"></a>The Marketplace offers the following **Content Types**:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Solutions** | Out-of-the-box solutions are aimed at industries and domain problems, and they deliver instant value. These solutions can be adapted using the core Mendix Platform to fully meet your requirements. |
| **Templates** | Templates and starter apps serve as accelerators for implementing solutions to help increase speed-to-value and time-to-market. |
| **App Services** | App services are packages of preconfigured business capabilities provided as modules containing logic, UIs, workflows, connectors, and APIs. |
| [Connectors](/appstore/connectors/) | Connectors are for connecting data services. They have content that you can drag from the [Connector](/refguide/view-menu/#connector) pane in Studio Pro into your app.|
| [Modules](/appstore/modules/) | Modules are packages of functionality for your app. They consist of a domain model, security options, and other elements like microflows, pages, or Java actions. Modules are mostly used for complex functionality that needs business or Java logic. |
| [Widgets](/appstore/widgets/) | Widgets are single user-interface elements like containers, drop-down menus, and buttons. Select a widget, configure it, and add it to pages and snippets in your app. |
| **Platform Services** | These services for Mendix Platform integration accessible through the Marketplace include [Data Hub](/data-hub/). |

<a id="industry"></a>The Marketplace offers **Industry** solutions for manufacturing, financial services, and other industries.

The following filter options are also available:

* **Rating**
* **Compatibility**
* **Tags**

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/app-store-overview/component-details.png" >}}

### 3.1 Header and Usage

The header for a component presents the following details:

* The name and category of the component
* The review average (in stars) and the number of reviews
* The number of times the component has been downloaded
* <a id="saved"></a>The **Save and get notified** button which, when clicked, will add the component to the list on the [My Marketplace](#my-marketplace)

* **Download** – click this to download the component
    * This is only available for components that have a file attached (meaning, all shared Studio Pro components, but not promotions)
    * The best practice is to download a component from the Marketplace functionality built into Studio Pro, because it then downloads directly into Studio Pro (for details on importing downloaded Marketplace content into Studio Pro, see the [Installing Marketplace Content](/appstore/general/app-store-content/#install) section in *Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro*))
* The partner icon is applied to components that are supported by a partner:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/app-store-overview/partner.png"  width="25"  >}}

    * These components have a **Contact Us** button for setting up your subscription with the partner
    * If you already have an active subscription or trial, click **View status** to go to the [Company Subscriptions](#company-subscriptions) page

<a id="usage"></a>The **Usage** section presents  the following information (depending on the type of component):

* The latest **Version** number of the component
* The Studio Pro version that the component **Requires** to work
* The type of [license](/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/#license) for the component

The **Publisher** section presents the name of the company who created the component as well as the **Date** when the component was first published.

The **Developers** section presents the names of the developers who most recently updated the component, with links to their [Mendix Profile](/developerportal/mendix-profile/).

The **Support** section presents the category of support Mendix offers for the component (for more details, see [Marketplace Content Support](/appstore/general/app-store-content-support/)).

* **Documentation** – can include details on typical use cases, features and limitations, dependencies, installation and configuration, and frequently asked questions
    * [Platform-supported](/appstore/general/app-store-content-support/#category) components are documented in the various categories of this *Marketplace Guide*
    * Click **Edit documentation** to open a text editor where you can edit the Marketplace component's documentation

### 4.8 Company Subscriptions {#company-subscriptions}

You can see all the Marketplace app services your company has subscribed to on this page:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/app-store-overview/company-subscriptions.png" >}}

The table presents the **Names** of the products your company has subscribed to. Clicking a product name takes you to the [service management dashboard](#service-management-dashboard) for the component. 

The table also presents the **Technical Owner** of the company subscription. When subscribing for a paid component, you can assign the **Technical Owner** role to a user in your company. The Technical Owner can create binding keys on the [service management dashboard](#service-management-dashboard) and do other tasks.

Finally, the table presents the plan's **Status**, the subscription **Plan**, and the **Expires On** date for the plan.

#### 4.8.1 Service Management Dashboard {#service-management-dashboard}

This dashboard presents an overview of your service instances and binding keys. A service instance is what Mendix creates when you subscribe to an app service. After the service instance has been created, you need binding keys to use the app service in your app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only a Technical Owner for the subscription can create binding keys. When a user from your company wants to request a free trial (and there is already a Technical Owner), they will not have separate unique binding keys. The Technical Owner has to provide the binding keys to the user.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only a Technical Owner for the subscription can edit the instance name and manage the instance’s settings on external platforms. 
{{% /alert %}}

This page presents the **Binding Key Names** that have been created as well as details on the user who created the binding keys (**Created By**) and when the binding keys were created (**Created At**). Click **Delete** to delete that group of binding keys.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/app-store-overview/binding-keys.jpg" >}}

You can also select a group of binding keys and click **Manage Instance** to go to the component provider's configuration page, where you can do further configuration.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This additional management option is only available for specific app services where necessary.
{{% /alert %}}

##### 4.8.1.1 Creating Binding Keys {#creating-binding-keys}

To create binding keys for a specific [subscription](#company-subscriptions), click **Create Binding Keys**. In the dialog box, enter a name for the keys that includes the name of the app where you intend to use the component you have subscribed to (so that it is clear to other users where the keys are used).

After you click **Create Keys**, a page appears with your binding keys. Click **Copy** for each key and manually save the keys somewhere safe.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Once you close this page, you will not be able to retrieve the keys again.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information, see the [Using the Binding Keys](#using) section below.

Click **Return to the overview** to go to the main page of the dashboard. 

##### 4.8.1.2 Using the Binding Keys {#using}

When you are developing your app, set the app service's binding keys as [constants](/refguide/configuration/#constants) in the [App Settings](/refguide/app-settings/).

Refer to the documentation on specific app services for how to use the binding keys (for example, see the [Authenticating MindSphere REST Calls](/partners/siemens/mindsphere-app-service/#authenticating) section of *MindSphere IIoT for Makers*).

On this tab, you can enter the email address of a Mendix Platform user from your company and click **Add Member** to add them as a content group member. User group members can manage the [content](#group-content) assigned to the group.

Once a member is added, you can select their permission level: **Group Member** or **Group Admin**.

To remove a member, click **Remove** next to their name.

#### 4.10.3 Guests Tab {#guests}

A guest is a Mendix Platform user from outside your organization who can download the selected private [Content](#group-content) of this group. To add a guest, enter their email address in the box and click **Add Guest**:

The guest will receive an email notifying them of access to the private content. They can then see all the private Marketplace content shared with them in their [Shared with Me](#shared-with-me) page.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The guest must be a registered Mendix Platform user; otherwise, they will not be able to access the shared content.
{{% /alert %}}

To remove a guest, click **Remove**.
