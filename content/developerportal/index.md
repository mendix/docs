## 1 What Is the Developer Portal?

The [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) is one of the three key components of the Mendix Platform. The other two are [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling) and [Mendix Studio](/studio/index). In the Developer Portal, Mendix developers can collaborate, deploy, and manage their apps, and manage their company and users. 

The Developer Portal also offers open, well-defined APIs, enabling third-party developers to integrate their own widgets and plugins. For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/).

You can go to any part of the Developer Portal using the menu items described below.

## 2 Buzz {#buzz}

In the company [Buzz](collaborate/buzz), you can communicate with colleagues, App Team members, stakeholders, and any other Mendix users in your company:
