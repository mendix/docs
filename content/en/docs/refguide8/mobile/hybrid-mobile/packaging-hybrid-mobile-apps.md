A Mendix hybrid application is a hybrid of a web and native app. If you want to publish your hybrid app on the Apple App Store or Google Play, you have to wrap your app in a native shell. Mendix uses local builds to accomplish this. For instructions on how to make and deploy local builds, see [How to Build a Mendix Hybrid App Locally](/howto8/mobile/build-hybrid-locally/).
