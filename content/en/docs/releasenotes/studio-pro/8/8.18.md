## 8.18.18 {#81818}

**Release date: June 1st, 2022**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.18" %}}

### Improvements

* We fixed [CVE-2022-27241](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#27241).

### Fixes

* <a name="148047"></a>We fixed a [known issue](#ki-148047) where copy-pasting was not possible in pages, page templates, or layouts with a master layout. (Ticket 148047)
* We fixed an issue where the hidden aggregate columns of a data grid crashed the page. (Ticket 145306)
* We fixed an issue where layout arguments overlapped, making it difficult to add widgets to them. (Ticket 149524)
* We fixed an issue in the **Headers from a microflow** feature of consumed OData services. In the Runtime memory, the headers returned by this microflow are now marked as deleted to make sure the header values are not communicated to the client.
* We fixed an issue in MySQL 8.0.29 and above that occurred when dropping a column with a name length over 53 characters long.

### Breaking Changes

* We now block changes to the **Password** attribute of User and User-derived objects in client commits (for example, via the Save button in forms). The old behavior is deprecated but can be restored until Mendix 10 by setting the `BlockPasswordInClientCommit` custom setting to `false`.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.17 {#81817}

**Release date: April 14th, 2022**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.17" %}}

### Improvements

* We now support MariaDB 10.6.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where a [Decision](/refguide8/decision/) activity directly connected to a [Merge](/refguide8/merge/) activity at the end of a [Loop](/refguide8/loop/) activity in a nanoflow caused errors. (Ticket 138938)
* We fixed an issue that caused errors to appear in the browser console when erasing text from a RichText widget. (Ticket 142437)
* We fixed an issue where the [Runtime Server](/refguide8/runtime-server/) could not determine the correct time zone, which caused issues with XPath date functions on some databases. (Tickets 144700, 131707, 119712)

### Known Issues

* <a name="ki-148047"></a>Copy-pasting is not possible in pages, page templates, or layouts with a master layout. (Ticket 148047)
	* Fixed in [8.18.18](#148047).
* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.16 {#81816}

**Release date: February 21st, 2022**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.16" %}}

### Improvements

* We prioritized the **Check if object exists** decision recommendation after the retrieve-object operation in the [MxAssist Logic Bot](/refguide8/mx-assist-studio-pro/) menu.
* MxAssist Logic Bot now always shows a parameterized list for the **Calculate from a list** menu item.
* We added the possibility to specify the BCrypt cost when configuring the hash algorithm via a custom setting. To do this, use the value `BCRYPT:cost` for the setting `HashAlgorithm`, where `cost` can be a value from 10 to 30. If you only specify the value `BCRYPT`, a default `cost` value will be used.
* We changed the way [dangling references](/refguide8/offline-first/#dangling-references) are handled during the synchronization process. A dangling reference error can occur when trying to synchronize a committed object that is associated with an uncommitted object. Synchronization used to be prevented from starting if the set of objects to be synchronized contained an object with a dangling reference, and an error message was then shown on the device. Now, synchronization is not stopped when such an error occurs. Instead, all objects are synchronized except ones with dangling references, for which **System.SynchronizationError** records are created in the runtime database that contain the data of the uncommitted objects.

### Fixes

* We fixed [CVE-2022-24309](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#24309).
* We upgraded the Cloud Foundry client (`mx-cf-client`) by updating Apache Log4j libraries to 2.17.1 to address [CVE-2021-45105](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf) and [CVE-2021-44832](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf).
* We fixed an issue where the target namespace in [XML schema import](/refguide8/xml-schema-support/) was not stored in the Mendix app, resulting in the failure of XML validation during import and export mappings in Mendix Runtime. (Ticket 123183)
* We fixed an issue that occurred with an import mapping that was not committed when the mapping method was **Find by key** and the child objects could not be retrieved by association. (Ticket 126464)
* We fixed an issue where client certificates with empty passwords could not be used. (Ticket 137950)
* We fixed a bug with the [Auto-synchronize](/refguide8/on-click-event/#save-changes) option in online profiles that caused a crash when the action was used. (Ticket 138115)
* We fixed a bug where deployment failed when a [List operation](/refguide8/list-operation/) activity with a sort operation was used in a nanoflow. This bug occurred when the list was sorted based on an attribute defined in one of the generalizations of the sorted entity. (Ticket 138310) 
* We fixed an issue with native mobile apps that prevented an app from starting when a user had unsynchronized changes and was implicitly logged out. In such a case, it was possible for startup synchronization to fail to complete due to user access rights with no actionable mitigation path.
* We fixed an issue in MxAssist Logic Bot where the [Microflow call](/refguide8/microflow-call/) activity could not be inserted if the exposed microflow existed in the app.
* We fixed an issue where MxAssist Logic Bot generated an incorrect aggregate action for the calculate maximum and calculate minimum suggestions.
* We fixed an issue where the MxAssist Logic bar toggle was shown for non-editable microflows.
* We fixed an issue where a change inside a document did not show up in the the updated [Find Usages](/refguide8/find-and-find-advanced/#find-usages) results until another change occurred or the app was reopened.

### Breaking Changes

* When accessing the contents of file documents, access rules on the **Contents** attribute are now checked instead of relying entity access alone.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.15 {#81815}

**Release date: December 22nd, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.15" %}}

### Fixes

* We upgraded the Cloud Foundry client (`mx-cf-client`) by updating Apache Log4j libraries to 2.17.0, which addresses [CVE-2021-45105](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf).

### Deprecations

* Starting with version 8.18.17, we will drop support for the following database versions that are no longer supported by vendors:
	* PostgreSQL 9.6	

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.14 {#81814}

**Release date: December 17th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.14" %}}

### New Features

* We added support for PostgreSQL 14.
* We updated the regions for [Language Settings](/refguide8/language-settings/).
* This update enables Studio Pro to run on Apple Silicon Macs, such as the M1. Studio Pro is now enabled and tested to run on all Macs using Parallels 17 and Windows 11.

### Fixes

* We fixed [CVE-2022-25650](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#25650).
* <a name="44228"></a>We upgraded the Cloud Foundry client (`mx-cf-client`) used to deploy Mendix applications from Mendix Studio Pro to compromised Cloud Foundry services by updating Apache Log4j libraries to 2.16.0, which addresses [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-714170.pdf).
* We fixed an issue that occurred with the [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid/) inline editor while non-persistable entities were used. (Ticket 133700)
* We fixed an issue in the runtime of published OData services where the microflow of an exposed virtual attribute retrieved objects by association and the list was empty. (Ticket 128843)

### Deprecations

* Starting with version 8.18.16, we will drop support for DB2 version 11.1.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.13 {#81813}

**Release date: November 4th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.13" %}}

### Improvements

* We upgraded the SVG library to version 3.3.0.
* This release includes a [new version](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mendix-mxassist-logic-bot-upgrade/) of the [MxAssist Logic Bot](/refguide8/mx-assist-studio-pro/) with major improvements in the AI model, UI and UX, and performance! 
   * The AI model has been re-trained with a fresh and substantially bigger dataset that includes more context-related features, microflow actions, and parameters. These have improved the recommendation accuracy, especially the top (first) recommendation.
    * The user interface has been completely redesigned with better integration and interaction with the microflow editor UI to avoid any overlaps. In addition, new controls and interfaces are introduced to give more control to the users.
    * The user interface responsiveness and interaction is now faster thanks to several performance optimizations that have reduced server calls by 92% and user CPU usage by 35% on average. The Logic Bot microservice is also deployed in more regions to reduce network latency..
    * In addition, the Logic Bot now triggers notifications so you can be notified about improvements. Finally, in the decision context menu, the Logic Bot shows expressions with user variables above expressions with system variables.

### Fixes

* We fixed [CVE-2021-42026](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#42026) and [CVE-2021-42025](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#42025).
* We fixed an issue with the [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid/)'s drop-down search containing no values. (Ticket 107361)
* We fixed an issue where the expand button was sometimes displayed in the **Select Entity** dialog box for an entity without another associated entity. (Ticket 127417).
* We fixed an issue where imported SVG images appeared in the black color. (Ticket 130343)
* We fixed an issue where invalid SVG files in the image collection crashed Studio Pro while publishing an app. (Ticket 131378)

## 8.18.11 {#81811}

**Release date: September 27th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.11" %}}

### Fixes

* We fixed a bug in native mobile where list views with on-click events required two taps to trigger an event when the keyboard was visible. (Ticket 120695)
* We fixed an issue where a list view failed if attributes of an associated entity were retrieved and two objects of the main entity were linked to the same object of that associated entity. (Ticket 126507)
* We fixed the use of single parameter values in OQL `IN` query conditions. (Ticket 126647)
* We fixed the failing synchronization that occurred when a one-to-one or many-to-one association was renamed to an existing association that was removed. (Ticket 128052)
* We fixed an issue that resulted in custom SSL certificates not being used for all connections when Amazon S3 was configured as a storage service. (Ticket 129549).
* We fixed an issue in the JSON exporter where a "null" string was exported as a JSON null value. (Ticket 129742)
* We now block marking inactive users as active when the named users license limit is exceeded. We do not block creating inactive users anymore in this situation.
* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 9.4.0. If you use the [Database Connector](/appstore/connectors/database-connector/) module with SQL Server and integrated security, you may need to update the JDBC driver in **userlib** as well.
* We fixed an issue where [MxAssist Logic Bot](/refguide8/mx-assist-studio-pro/) displayed slightly stale recommendations if calls to a microflow were recently added or removed from another microflow.

* We fixed an error that occurred when using [import mapping](/refguide8/import-mappings/) with a large amount of objects. (Ticket 111544)
* We fixed an issue that occurred when calling sub-microflows with parameters that go over associations. (Tickets 114521, 126033, 125908)
* We fixed an issue where synchronization failed for the Oracle database if an unlimited attribute was changed to a limited attribute. (Ticket 120186)
* We fixed an issue where NPEs were not returned from a microflow in certain cases. (Ticket 125909)
* We fixed an issue in iOS where pickers did not respect the current device orientation but always defaulted to portrait mode. (Tickets 127454, 127687)
* We fixed an issue that occurred when using single parameter values in OQL `IN` query conditions. (Ticket 126647)
* We fixed an issue where Google API changes introduced problems for Android native app builds. For more information, see [Update Needed for Android Native Mobile Apps](https://www.mendix.com/blog/update-needed-for-android-native-mobile-apps/).

## 8.18.8 {#8188}

**Release date: June 30th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.8" %}}

### Improvements

* The date range search field of a data grid now allows the upper and lower bounds to be inclusive. (Ticket 119173)
* We improved how the native [drop-down](/refguide8/drop-down/) widget renders menu items on larger devices. (Ticket 122196)
* We improved the startup of the runtime by not registering handlers for REST, OData, and web services when the model does not contain any REST, OData, or web services, respectively. This has several advantages: it makes your app start up slightly faster, there are fewer log messages at startup, and it follows the security best practice of endpoint hardening.
* We now log the addition of request handlers and WebSocket endpoints.
* We improved the performance of the **Build deployment structure** step when building your app. The time needed for **Exporting pages** decreased up to 60%, and **Exporting metadata** decreased up to 90%.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where extracting a microflow as a sub-microflow with a loop that had multiple parameters did not  set the parameters correctly on the extracted sub-microflow. (Tickets 97103, 110679)
* We fixed an issue where extra newlines were added to the end of an expression when typing in the expression editor. (Tickets 101033, 103209, 105990, 107049, 107239, 114492, 115807, 115894, 116692, 116963, 118606, 119602, 122468)
* We fixed an issue where temporary files and folders (like **GPUCache**) were created in the app directory, which led to unnecessary merge conflicts. (Tickets 105909, 106329, 107857)
* We fixed an error that occurred when a conditional editability expression referenced a non-existent attribute when the widget was non-editable due to its parent container (for example, a list view or data view). (Ticket 121857)
* We fixed an issue that occurred when multiple rows were selected in the **Changes** pane and copied to the Windows clipboard via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, but only some of the rows were copied multiple times. (Ticket 123191)
* We upgraded the SQL Server JDBC driver authentication DLL files to 9.2.1. (Ticket 124044)
* We fixed an issue where MxAssist Logic Bot sent a common flow type to the server to make a suggestion instead of the exact type.
* We fixed a crash that occurred when conflicts after an [update or merge](/refguide8/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) were only present on the files in the app folder and not on the app itself.

### Deprecations

* We dropped support for the following database versions that are no longer supported by vendors:
	* Oracle 18
	* SQL Server 2016

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.7 {#8187}

**Release date: June 10th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.7" %}}

### Improvements

* We implemented a toggle switch for the [MxAssist Logic Bot](/refguide8/mx-assist-studio-pro/) in the microflow editor, and we removed the **Ready/Thinking** indicator.
* We added an MxAssist Logic Bot menu to the existing click-drag menu in the microflow editor.
* The license server now respects the JVM proxy options: *https.proxyHost*, *https.proxyPort*, *https.proxyUser*, *https.proxyPassword*, and *http.nonProxyHosts*.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where extra new lines were added to the end of an expression when typing in the expression editor. (Tickets 101033, 103209, 105990, 107049, 107239, 115807, 115894, 116692, 116963, 118606, 119602, 122468)
* We fixed an issue where it was not possible to navigate through a multi-select search field on a data grid using the keyboard. (Ticket 122123)

* We fixed an issue where running an offline-first app in a cluster produced warnings when trying to remove a non-existent session on another node. (Ticket 108018)
* We fixed an issue that occurred when a conditional editability expression referenced a non-existent attribute when the widget was non-editable due to its parent container (for example, a list view or data view). (Ticket 120665)
* We fixed an issue where certain operations in Studio Pro (such as adding or removing an entity) were very slow in apps with large pages that used a lot of expressions. (Ticket 119503)
* We fixed an issue in [hybrid mobile apps](/refguide8/hybrid-mobile/) where adding allowed extensions caused unexpected behaviour in iOS and Android. (Tickets 110248, 115364)
* When an XPath constraint used the `%CurrentObject%` token in a nested constraint on a path over multiple associations, this resulted in an error in the client. This has been fixed. (Ticket 119134)
* We fixed an issue where a read-only attribute was shown as writable when using specializations. (Ticket 111341)
* We fixed an error that occurred when refreshing the list of Team Server apps in the [Open App](/refguide8/open-app-dialog/) dialog box. (Ticket 112763)
* We fixed an issue where selecting an icon using the keyboard was not possible after filtering. (Ticket 104249)
* The [file manager](/refguide8/file-manager/) widget when configured with **Type** > **Upload** no longer causes an unexpected error when there are validation errors in certain scenarios. (Ticket 120116)
* We fixed an issue with the [reference selector](/refguide8/reference-selector/) widget when it contained conditional editability where it triggerred a microflow or database data retrieval twice. (Ticket 104322)
* We fixed a runtime issue where log messages from components that use Apache commons logging ended up on the console output of the app. These messages are no longer written to the console output of the app. We introduced a new custom setting where you can set `EnableApacheCommonsLogging` to `true` to see these log messages in the Mendix logs. (Tickets 103160, 118254)
* We improved the performance of XML imports in a transactional context. (Ticket 119050)

* We fixed the behavior of allowed extensions when configured for the file manager widget in iOS Safari on iPhone and iPad.
* A change to a page now ultimately triggers an MxAssist Logic Bot update (context change).
* We fixed a medium-severity security issue where [write access](/refguide8/access-rules/) could be bypassed in certain scenarios. (Fixed CVE-2021-33718)
* We fixed an issue where MxAssist Logic Bot recommended committing a non-persistable entity.
* In some situations, the **Update** action in the [Update Widgets](/refguide8/project-menu/#update-widgets) tool did not update the widget, although it was showing that it had the latest version in the overview. This has been fixed.
* We fixed an issue which prevented enabling MxAssist Logic Bot for already-opened microflow editors.
* We resolved an error that occurred when installing Studio Pro because an additional file could not be downloaded.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.

* A change to a page now ultimately triggers an MxAssist Logic Bot update for a context change.
* In some situations, the **Update** action in the [Update Widgets](/refguide8/project-menu/#update-widgets) tool did not update the widget, although it was showing that it had the latest version in the overview. This has been fixed.
* We fixed an issue which prevented enabling the MxAssist Logic Bot for a microflow editor that had already been opened.
* We fixed an issue where the Buddhist calendar did not work properly in Android mobile browsers. Now, Android mobile browsers will show the Mendix app calendar instead of the native calendar.
* We resolved an error that occurred when installing Studio Pro because an additional file could not be downloaded.

### Deprecations

* Starting with version 8.18.8, we will drop support for Microsoft SQL Server 2016, which will no longer be supported by its vendor.

### Breaking Changes

* It is no longer possible to add mathematical expressions in an XPath outside of [tokens](/refguide8/xpath-keywords-and-system-variables/#time-related). Mathematical expressions should be calculated outside of the XPath expression.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

* We fixed a performance regression in loop execution. (Ticket 118288)
We fixed the **list subtraction** operation, which now maintains the order of items. (Ticket 117625)
* We improved the validity of sessions in session caches. As a result, changes made on one cluster node will now eventually be reflected on others. Also, `Core.getSessionById` will update the current session and related data in the current cluster node's session cache if the session validation timeout is passed. (Ticket 113448)
* We fixed an issue with the document template when a conditionally visible row was always rendered if the enclosing data view had an empty object. (Ticket 115502)
* We fixed an issue where revisions that were already merged were not shown as unavailable when doing a subsequent advanced merge from the same branch. (Ticket 117916)

## 8.18.3 {#8183}

**Release date: March 17th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.3" %}}

### Improvements

* When running an app without a license, the [Data Hub limitation on the number of objects](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service-requirements/) no longer applies.
* We improved the performance of domain model interactions when the search functionality is used in [Data Hub](/data-hub/).
* We added a read-only **App repository address** field to the [private-server Sign In box](/refguide8/upload-to-version-control-dialog/#private-server), so now you know what private repository you are connecting to. For more information, see [How to Work with an On-Premises Version Control Server](/howto8/collaboration-requirements-management/on-premises-svn-howto/).
* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 9.2.0. If you use the [Database Connector](/appstore/connectors/database-connector/) module with SQL Server and integrated security, you may need to update the JDBC driver in `userlib` as well.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where multiple sessions did not work as expected in offline applications when [Multiple users per session](/refguide8/project-settings/#multiple-sessions) was turned off. (Ticket 113783)

* We fixed an issue where creating the [deployment package](/refguide8/create-deployment-package-dialog/) for an app failed. (Ticket 117393)
* We fixed an issue with the editable [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid/) where the default German date format was not recognized. (Ticket 117168)
* We fixed an issue in the [file manager](/refguide8/file-manager/) widget that caused unexpected extensions to be invalid (for example, *.PDF*, *.pDf*). (Ticket 116909)
* Documentation in Studio Pro 9 Guide was opened via <kbd>F1</kbd> and **Help** instead of [Studio Pro 8 Guide](/refguide8/). This has been fixed.
* We fixed a bug that was causing a crash whenever an app was opened that needed to merge changes introduced from outside Studio Pro.
* We improved the process of [reverting all changes](/refguide8/version-control-menu/#revert-all). You will no longer be asked to save before reverting. We also fixed a crash that occurred when you reverted while the app was running.

### Deprecations

* We will drop support for Oracle 18 before June 30th. We will announce this again when the support is dropped.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.

## 8.18.2 {#8182}

**Release date: March 8th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.2" %}}

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in [published OData services](/refguide8/published-odata-services/) where an error occurred when a client queried the service using `$select` in combination with expanding (`$expand`) an association from the child's side. (Ticket 113523)
* We fixed an issue in [consumed web services](/refguide8/consumed-web-services/) that logged a message "Operation getFaultNode not supported" when calling a SOAP 1.1 web service even though there was no problem. (Ticket 114070)
* We fixed an issue in [published REST service](/refguide8/published-rest-services/) POST operations with file form parameters where an empty file was written to storage when the body did not contain a part for it. Now, no file is written to storage. (Ticket 114991)
* We fixed an issue where adding a snippet call without a snippet led to an error. (Ticket 114041)

## 8.18.1 {#8181}

**Release date: February 1st, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.1" %}}

### Improvements

* We updated the [SAP HANA](/refguide8/saphana/) driver to 2.7.9.
* We now allow JDBC URL options to set data source properties for SAP HANA.
* We disabled the `transactionalLobs` option in SAP HANA.
* We improved the performance of the `Core.getActiveSession(userName)` method.

### Fixes

* We fixed a runtime issue in [Call REST](/refguide8/call-rest-action/) activities when calling endpoints that keep the connection alive. The issue occurred in Mendix Cloud v4- and AWS-hosted apps, because those environments sever connections after 6 minutes. Setting `http.client.CleanupAfterSeconds` to `355` fixes that issue, so now we use that as the default value. (Tickets 110860, 111317, 111881, 112067, 112073, 113401, 113920)

* We fixed an issue in native mobile apps where a focused text input was hidden behind the keyboard on Android devices. Make sure to also update your versions of the [Make It Native app](/releasenotes/mobile/make-it-native-app/) and [Native Builder](/releasenotes/mobile/native-builder/). (Ticket 113397)
* We fixed an issue where errors occurred when performing certain operations (for example, moving documents) when certain custom widgets existed in your app.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.

## 8.18.0 {#8180}

**Release date: January 26th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.0" %}}

### New Features

#### Selective Synchronization

When building offline-first apps, there are different scenarios to prepare for, and sometimes you may want to only synchronize a single object or a small set of objects instead of all the data. Good news, we have extended the synchronization capabilities with the option to only synchronize selected objects from the device with the server. Now, the power is in your hands and the choice is yours. Use the [Synchronize](/refguide8/synchronize/) activity in a nanoflow to synchronize all or selected objects (which can be both objects and files). This feature can greatly improve the user experience of your app and offers more flexibility.

For more information, see the [Synchronization](/refguide8/offline-first/#synchronization) section of *Offline-First*.

#### The Future of Mobile Apps

At Mendix, we want to provide our customers with a future-proof platform, a significant part of which is always determined by underlying technology. We believe that [native mobile apps](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mobile-apps-go-native-part-i/) and [progressive web apps (PWAs)](https://www.mendix.com/mobile-architecture/#progressive-web-apps) are the future for mobile apps, in that they deliver a best-of-breed approach for building app store- and browser-based mobile apps. For more information, see the [Establishing Your Mobile Architecture Strategy](https://www.mendixworld.com/session/establishing-your-mobile-architecture-strategy/) session from last year's Mendix World.

We do not consider hybrid mobile (which is based on Cordova) to be future-proof technology anymore. Therefore, we would like to inform you that we have disabled the creation of hybrid mobile apps in this version of Studio Pro and have deprecated hybrid mobile apps in Studio Pro [9](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.0/).

For more information, see [Mendix Is First-to-Market with Expanded "All-in-One" Low-Code Platform; Launches Pre-Packaged Industry Apps for Even Faster Adoption of Low-Code in the Enterprise](https://www.mendix.com/press/mendix-is-first-to-market-with-expanded-all-in-one-low-code-platform-launches-pre-packaged-industry-apps-for-even-faster-adoption-of-low-code-in-the-enterprise/).

#### Support for Non-Filterable & Non-Sortable Attributes

We added support for attributes that cannot be used for filtering or sorting. Previously, it was not possible to consume non-filterable or non-sortable attributes. Now it is possible to consume these attributes, extending what can you do with data from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/).

To better support OData for Mendix Data Hub, we added the concept of [attribute limitations](/refguide8/attributes/#limitations). Sometimes attributes in OData do not support sorting or filtering, and now Studio Pro is aware of that. Studio Pro shows an error to warn you when you do something with an attribute that is not possible, while allowing you to use the attributes for everything else.

The concept of attribute limitations is now extended to existing attribute types. This does not change their functionality (because these attribute types always had some restrictions), and now they behave the same as other non-filterable and non-sortable attributes.

### Improvements

* We added consistency checks to ensure the uniqueness of exposed names and exposed set names for published OData resources.
* We added a new way to specify which client certificate to use in the [Call REST service](/refguide8/call-rest-action/) and [Call web service](/refguide8/call-web-service-action/) activities.
* We improved the user interface for modeling [published OData services](/refguide8/published-odata-services/) in Studio Pro. The old tree view of published attributes and associations is now a list.
* We now show the associations of [external entities](/refguide8/external-entities/) in the [Data Hub pane](/refguide8/data-hub-pane/). Multiple associations between the same pair of external entities are grouped together, listing individual associations in the tooltip. Unsupported associations are grayed out and show a tooltip explaining the reason.
* The [Commit](/refguide8/committing-objects/) activity is now included in **Find usages** results.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where certain operations on binaries were only possible within a sudo context.
    {{% alert color="info" %}}Thanks to Marcel Groenweg for pointing this out!
    {{% /alert %}}
* We fixed an issue regarding the [Change list](/refguide8/change-list/) microflow activity where if a list was set to itself, the contents were cleared. (Ticket 109243)
* We fixed several possible data synchronization issues that occurred in offline-first applications. (Ticket 101598)
* We fixed an issue where the [reference selector](/refguide8/reference-selector/) widget did not show objects when used in an offline-first application. (Ticket 113384)
* We fixed an issue where a native mobile application failed to load during development. (Ticket 112952)
* We fixed an issue **View** > [Find](/refguide8/view-menu/#find) did not find the text that was typed as [published REST operation](/refguide8/published-rest-operation/) documentation. (Ticket 112648)
* We fixed an issue for published OData services where the app's default proxy settings were not used at runtime. (Ticket 109953)
* We fixed an issue where dynamic classes were not applied for [layout grid](/refguide8/layout-grid/) rows and cells, [table](/refguide8/table/) rows and cells, [scroll container](/refguide8/scroll-container/) regions, and [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid/) columns. We also fixed an issue where these were also not applied to the container widget. (Tickets 111048, 111810, 112312)
* When an XPath constraint used the `%CurrentObject%` token in a nested constraint, this resulted in an error in the client. This is now fixed. (Ticket 112034)
* When migrating files created before Mendix 6 to modern files, we now log the missing files instead of failing the migration. (Tickets 110317, 110969)
* We decreased the chance of deadlocks in our session administration system actions, and when deadlocks still occur, they are handled gracefully. (Ticket 111360)
* We fixed an issue that caused [Close page](/refguide8/close-page/) activities to stop working after upgrading to [8.17](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.17/). (Ticket 111576)
* We fixed an error where an error message appeared when you dragged a microflow onto the list of published REST operations and clicked **Cancel** on the dialog box.
* We fixed an issue in published OData services where publishing associations in a combination of entities with generalizations resulted in an incorrect contract.
* We fixed an issue where the picker element of an inline native [drop-down](/refguide8/drop-down/) widget did not update on a selected value change when opened.
* We fixed an issue where the current branch was showing in the list of available branches to [merge](/refguide8/merge-dialog/).

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
