## 1 Introduction

Button widgets perform an action when clicked. They can be rendered as a button or as a hyperlink. Button widgets contain the following:

* [Action Button](action-button)
* [Close Page Button](back-button)
* [Drop-Down Button](drop-down-button)

All buttons have an [Image Property](image-property) which indicates which image will be shown in front of the caption of a button.
