## 1 Introduction

Hybrid mobile apps are deprecated as of Mendix 9. This means that hybrid mobile apps are still supported in Mendix 9 but their usage is discouraged. Accordingly, the creation of new hybrid navigation profiles is disabled.

For more information see this [Hybrid Mobile Apps Deprecation with Mendix 9](https://www.mendix.com/blog/hybrid-mobile-apps-deprecation-with-mendix-9/) blog entry.
