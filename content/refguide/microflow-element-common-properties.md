## 1 Introduction

This document describes common properties that are shared by many elements in the microflow editor.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
Not every element in a microflow or a nanoflow has all of these properties.
{{% /alert %}}

These are the common properties for microflows and nanoflows:

* [Caption](#caption)
* [Auto-generate caption](#auto-generate-caption)
* [Background color](#color)
* [Error handling type](#error-handling)

## 2 Caption {#caption}

The **Caption** describes what happens in this element. 

## 3 Auto-Generate Caption {#auto-generate-caption}

The **Auto-generate caption** property specifies whether the caption is automatically generated based on the type of activity.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Yes  *(default)* | The caption of the activity is generated by Studio Pro. |
| No | You can edit the caption yourself in the **Caption** property. |

## 3 Background Color {#color}

The **Background color** property allows you to choose a background color for the activity. Colors do not influence execution; they are only used to quickly spot an element in a flow. For example, you can make activities with [error handlers](microflows#errorhandlers) red so you can easily identify them.

A background color can be specified for an individual activity by selecting the activity and then choosing a color in the **Properties** pane. You can select a default color for all the activities of a certain type in **Project Settings** > [Miscellaneous](project-settings#miscellaneous). The default color can also be changed by right-clicking a microflow activity and selecting **Set as default color** from the context menu. This will make the current activities' color the default color for all activities of the same type. If you change the default color for an activity type and there are other activities of that type present in the app project that have a different individual background color specified, you will be asked whether you want to overwrite these individual colors with the new default color.

## 4 Error Handling Type {#error-handling}

In **Error handling type**, you can choose the type of error handling for the activity. For details on available options and their effects, see the [Error Handlers](microflows#errorhandlers) section in *Microflows*.
