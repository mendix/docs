## 2 Setup in Studio Pro {#setup}

After you install the [Email Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120739), configure the following in Studio Pro:

1. Provide a value for the **EncryptionKey** constant available under **USE_ME** folder for password storage.
2. Launch the UI by using the **EmailConnector_OverviewPage** in the **USE_ME** folder.
3. Link [User Roles](/refguide/user-roles/) in app **Security** to ensure that the configuration page displays when you locally run the app.


## 3 Email Account Configuration {#accountconfig}

Once you run your Studio Pro app, you can start configuring your email accounts in the Email Connector UI.

### 3.1 Adding Email Account

You can add and configure an email account in the Email Connector either automatically or manually.

#### 3.1.1 Automatic Configuration

When you run your app to use this module for the first time, and earlier data is not present, you will see a welcome screen with an account setup wizard. Click on `Get Started` button and follow the steps to add email account. 

On the Email Connector dashboard, click on `Add Email Account` and follow the wizard.

#### 3.1.2 Manual Configuration

If you follow the wizard and if it fails to detect the email settings automatically, you will be asked to enter all the settings manually to add the email account.

In Studio Pro, you can use the `GetAutoConfig` Java action to get the all supported email configurations for the provided username. It will return results as `Email_Connector.EmailProvider`. Process the `Email_Connector.EmailProvider` records and get the desired configuration and create the `Email_Connector.EmailAccount`.

### 3.2 Other Account Settings {#other-account-settings}

You can set up the following additional account settings:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/email-connector/other-account-settings.png" >}}

* **Subscribe to incoming emails** – user can select this option to get notified about the new incoming emails for modeling use `SubscribeToIncomingEmail` Java action. Read more about this in the section below.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
This is only supported for IMAP protocols, and some servers may not support it at all.
{{% /alert %}}

* **Sanitize email to prevent XSS attacks** – option to enable the removal of malicious scripts to prevent XSS attacks. This option is unselected by default. To learn more about this option, see [Sanitize untrusted HTML (to prevent XSS)](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer).
* **Replicate everything in 'X' folder** – option to fetch emails
     * When this setting is not selected, the connector will fetch the number of emails mentioned in the **Number of emails to retrieve from server** configuration based on the selected **Fetch strategy**
     * When this setting is selected, checked then module will fetch all the emails (in order of oldest to newest) from that folder in batch size as mentioned in **Email Batch Size** configuration
* **Timeout** – the connection timeout for send email/receive emails operations. This can be set in the **Email Account** object.

## 4 Usage

Once you have set up an account, you can use it in microflow activities to send and/or receive emails. The information in the following sections includes usage instructions for in Studio Pro, as well as when you run the connector in your app.

### 4.1 Sending Email

When the module is running, click **New** to compose and send new emails.

When modeling your app in Studio Pro, use the **SendEmail** Java action to send emails. The input parameters are the following:

* **Email Account** Email account consisting of outgoing email configuration.
* **Email Message** Email Message object to be sent

The **Return type** is a boolean value. The Java action will connect to the email server using the provided details and send an email, and will return **True** if successful. If the action fails, the error object and cause will display.

The **To**, **Subject**, and **Email Content** fields are mandatory. Multiple email addresses can be specified in **To**, **CC**, or **BCC** separated by a semicolon (**;**).

### 4.2 Receiving Email

Click **Refresh** to receive emails. Emails will be fetched and processed by server as configured in the email account.

When modeling your app in Studio Pro, use **RetrieveEmailMessages** Java action. Once this Java action is called at background emails will be fetched over multiple Java threads and would be returned back to user in async manner. Email fetching will continue till the conditions defined in the email account settings at the Mendix side (like fetch Latest 1000 emails etc)

The input parameters for receiving email are the following: 

* **EmailAccount** – email account consisting of incoming email configuration
* **onEmailFetchMicroflow** – a microflow that will be triggered when **List of EmailMessage** is fetched from the email server per the batch size configured in the email account
    * You can process the list according to what you need. 
    * Make sure you have list of **Email_Connector.EmailMessage** as a parameter to this microflow. 
    * Refer to the sample microflow **OCH_EmailFetchMicroflow**.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
When duplicating this microflow, do not change input parameters’ name and data type.
{{% /alert %}}

* **onFetchCompleteMicroflow** – a microflow that will be triggered when the fetch is complete and there are no more emails for the particular Java action call
* **onFetchErrorMicroflow** – a microflow that will be triggered if there are errors during the fetch from email server operation

### 4.3 Using Email Templates

When the module is running, you can create templates to use for a specific email account.

In Studio Pro, you can configure this with the **SNIP_EmailTemplate_Overview** use this snippet to configure this functionality.

#### 4.3.1 Sending an email with a template

When modeling your app in Studio Pro, use the  **SendEmailWithTemplate** Java action.

The input parameters are the following:
* **Data Object** – entity object from which you want to extract the placeholder tokens
* **Email account** – email account consisting of outgoing email configuration
* **Email template** – email template from which email message object is created and sent
* **Queued** – when *true*, email message will be stored in the **EmailMessage** entity with status as **QUEUED** queued and user can sent it later using scheduled event or future. You can use microflow **SE_SendQueuedEmails** to create scheduled events.

You can refer to sample microflow **Sample_ACT_SendEmailWithTemplate**.

### 4.4 Signed and Encrypted Emails

You can choose to configure a digital signature and email encryption when the module is running.

In Studio Pro, these settings are found in the domain model of the Email Connector:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/email-connector/sign-encrypt-domain-model.png" >}}

#### 4.4.1 Digital Signing

Digitally signed emails support only PKCS#12 certificates.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/email-connector/digital-signature.png" >}}

#### 4.4.2 Email Encryption

Encryption for emails using the Email Connector module includes the following:

* Supports LDAP servers for sending encrypted emails
* Supports **Simple** and **No** (anonymous) authentication method
* Supports SSL/TLS and non-SSL connection types
* While encrypting email, the recipient's public certificate will be searched for on the Base DN

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/email-connector/email-encryption.png" >}}

### 4.5 Subscribing to Incoming Email

When modeling your app in Studio Pro, call the **SubscribeToIncomingEmail** Java action to subscribe to incoming email from an account.

The input parameters are the following:

* **Email account** – email account consisting of incoming email configuration
* **onNewEmailReceivedMicroflow** – a microflow that will be triggered when new email (List) is received from the server. You can process the list per your need. Make sure you have list of **Email_Connector.EmailMessage** as a parameter to this microflow. Refer to the sample microflow **OCH_EmailFetchMicroflow*.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
When duplicating this microflow, do not change the input parameter name and data type.
{{% /alert %}}

* **onSubscriptionStateChangedMicroflow** – a microflow that will be triggered when subscription state is changed state can any of the following:
     * `SUBSCRIPTIONFAILED`
     * `CONNECTIONTOSERVERLOST`
     * `CONNECTIONRETRYEXHAUSTED`
     Make sure that microflow is accepting the string parameters `State` and `Comment`. Refer to the sample microflow **OCH_SubscriptionStateChanged**.
     {{% alert color="warning" %}}
     When duplicating this microflow, do not change input parameters’ name and data type.
    {{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Before subscribing to incoming email, it is recommended to attempt to unsubscribe from incoming email so that application will not end up having duplicate subscription for a single email account. The complete flow of subscription is shown in the microflow **ACT_SubscribeForEmailNotification**.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The subscription to new emails will only work if email account is configured with IMAP/S protocol and if the email server supports notifications. The subscription will end if the app is stopped. To subscribe again in between app restarts, register the **Sample_ASU_SubscribeForEmailNotification** microflow in the **After Startup** option. 
{{% /alert %}}

### 4.6 Unsubscribing from Incoming Email

When modeling your app in Studio Pro, use the **UnsubscribeFromIncomingEmail** Java action. When used with account parameter, the user (for the provided account) will be unsubscribed from incoming email.

The input paramater includes the following:

* **Email account** – email account consisting of incoming email configuration

### 4.6 Creating a Account Using Custom Encryption

In most cases, following the steps in the [Setup in Studio Pro](#setup) and [Email Account Configuration](#accountconfig) sections above are sufficient. You might prefer to use custom encryption for storing the email account password, instead of using the [Encryption](/appstore/modules/encryption/) module or storing the password as plain text.

When modelling your app in Studio Pro, use the [Create Object](/refguide/create-object/) activity to create the account, and then include the **Encrypt** Java action included in the Email Connector. The **Encrypt** Java action takes a *plain string* parameter and an *encryption key* of 32 characters. 

If you do not encrypt the password, all functions will still work as expected.

## 5 Key Microflows

* **Sample_ASU_SubscribeForEmailNotification** - an after startup microflow which will subscribe to email notification based on account settings
* **Sample_ACT_SendEmailWithTemplate** – a microflow that helps you set up send email using the template
* **SE_Cleanup** – a microflow that can be added to a schedule event and deletes email sent logs and sent emails of the past 30 days. The **EmailLogRetention** constant defines the amount of days to preserve messages.
* **SE_SendQueuedEmails** - a microflow can be added to a schedule event which will send emails which are marked as **QueuedForSending**

## 6 Troubleshooting

* If you already have the [Included Widgets](#included-widgets) widgets in your app, and they are not up-to-date, you may get a `Some widgets can not be read` error when trying to run locally.
* If the **Email Connector** page styling is affected as you select/view email messages, please turn on the **Sanitize email to prevent XSS attacks** option available in the [Account Settings](#other-account-settings). It is probably due to errors in the email message CSS, so this option should fix any issues.
