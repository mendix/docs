## 1 Introduction

`HttpRequest` is a system entity that represents a request to a server. `HttpResponse` represents the response from the server. Use these entities when [publishing](/refguide/published-rest-services/) or [consuming](/refguide/consumed-rest-services/) REST services.

## 2 HttpRequest {#http-request}

The `HttpRequest` entity has the following attributes:

|  Attribute  |  Type  |  Default Value | Description  |
|  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
|  `HttpVersion` (Inherited from `HttpMessage`) |  String  | HTTP/1.1 | The protocol version. You can almost always ignore this value. |
|  `Uri`  | String  | empty | The full URI for the incoming request, including query parameters. |
|  `Content` (inherited from `HttpMessage`) |  String  | empty | The body of the request. |

You can retrieve the request headers via the `HttpHeaders` association.

## 3 HttpResponse {#http-response}

The `HttpResponse` entity has the following attributes:

|  Attribute  |  Type  |  Default Value | Description  |
|  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
|  `HttpVersion` (inherited from `HttpMessage`)  |  String  | HTTP/1.1 | The protocol version. You can almost always ignore this value. |
|  `StatusCode`  |  Integer  | 200 | The HTTP status code returned by the server.  |
|  `ReasonPhrase`  |  String  |  OK | A textual representation of the `StatusCode`.  |
|  `Content`  |  String  | empty | The body of the response. |

For more information on HTTP status codes, see the [W3C Specification of Status Code Definitions](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).

You can retrieve or create response headers via the `HttpHeaders` association.

An important `HttpResponse` header is `Content-Type`, which indicates how the content should be interpreted. For more information on this header, see the [W3C specification of Content-Type](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/4_Content-Type.html).

### 3.1 Why Does Setting `ReasonPhrase` Have No Effect? {#reason-phrase}

The HTTP/1.x protocol allowed servers to include a reason phrase in the response, including non-standard ones. In HTTP/2, reason phrases have been removed. Many web servers (including the one Mendix Runtime uses), do not allow setting anything other than the default reason phrase for the status code (even in HTTP/1.x, which technically allows it).

As a result, the `ReasonPhrase` attribute is only useful for reading.
