## 1 Introduction

With [Mendix Business Events](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/202649), applications can signal when something important happens, and can independently subscribe to these events if they want to be informed. Business events are like a mailing list to share event notifications between apps.

The key difference between business events and traditional communication between apps, like REST or Web Services, is that there is no direct communication between the different apps. Applications publish events to, or subscribe to events with, an event broker. This results in much better availability for your applications, as applications are not impacted by downtime of other applications. It also simplifies your applications, as you reduce the fact that applications need to be aware of other applications, this simplifying dependency management and impact analysis when changing your software.

To deliver these events reliably between your applications, a Mendix Event Broker is required. For apps running the Mendix cloud on licensed nodes, you'll need to purchase a license for a [Mendix Event Broker](#mendix-event-broker). A limited multi-tenant Event Broker is provided for free apps in the Mendix cloud. If desired for development, you can run your own broker cluster.

Mendix Business Events is supported for Studio Pro [9.18](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.18/) and above.{{% /alert %}} 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Currently, business events can only be deployed to the [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/), with other deployment models expected in forthcoming releases.{{% /alert %}} 

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Business events help you automate the resulting actions when something happens in your organization. The following are examples of when business events can be useful:

* Uploading a payment receipt in one app, while another app processes the outgoing payment in the company's ledger
* Making an appointment with a service provider in an appointment app, then needing it to be added to the scheduling app of the service provider
* Customers placing an order in a webshop, and other apps need to take follow-up actions like scheduling shipment, sending the invoice, and reordering inventory stock

### 1.2 Pre-Requisites

To use Mendix Business Events, you will need the following:

* The [Mendix Business Events](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/202649) module from the Mendix Marketplace
* Studio Pro [9.18](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.18/) and above
* At least two Mendix apps: one that publishes the business events and makes them available, and one that subscribes to the business events (you can have as many publishing and consuming apps as you require)
* An event broker, either a licensed [Mendix Event Broker](#mendix-event-broker) for apps running in the Mendix Cloud or for local testing the [local testing](#local-testing) broker (see [Deployment](#deployment))
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for local deployment

## 2 Licensing {#licensing}

The Mendix Business Events module itself does not require a license, but it depends on an event broker to deploy to production environments. You can purchase a [Mendix Event Broker License](#event-broker-license) for a broker to be set up for you. See the [Mendix Event Broker](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/202907) platform service page for more details.

### 2.1 Mendix Event Broker License {#event-broker-license}

Purchase a license to the Mendix Event Broker to deploy unlimited apps on production environments in the Mendix Cloud. Ask your Customer Success Manager or Account Manager to get in touch with us to purchase a license. See the [Mendix Event Broker](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/202907) platform service page for more details.

Licenses for the Mendix Event Broker are available for all regions, but once selected, you can only run on a single region (no multi-region support). To learn more about how this broker works, see [Mendix Event Broker](#mendix-event-broker).

#### 2.1.1 Enabling the Mendix Event Broker Service {#enable-mx-event-broker}

Once a license is purchased, a Technical Contact must enable the Event Broker Service on the [Developer Portal](/developerportal/) for the [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/) in the following places:
     1. On the App level, under Environments > [Services](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#services)
     2. For all environments, on the [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#services) page

## 3 Mendix Event Broker {#mendix-event-broker}

The Mendix Event Broker is single-tenant, and will only be used by apps running on nodes provisioned for your company. 

The Mendix Event Broker is based on [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).
* Events are published to a Kafka topic
* Apps are subscribed to a Kafka topic to receive events, and messages use standard [CloudEvents payload format](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md)

There is a single Kafka broker for Free Apps that all your company Free Apps can connect to.
* All Free Apps in your company publish and consume from the same Kafka broker
* Events are published to one shared Kafka topic
* Any Free App in your company can receive these events

### 3.1 Managing the Mendix Event Broker {#manage-mx-broker}

Technical Contacts with a license to the Mendix Event Broker can manage its features in the [Developer Portal](/developerportal/) on the [Event Broker Manager](https://broker.mendix.com/) page.

#### 3.1.1 Environments and Spaces

**Spaces** define which applications will exchange events with each other. When Business Events is enabled for an environment, it is placed in an Event Broker **Space** based on the environment name. This enables apps deployed under the same **Space** to publish and consume events. For example, apps in acceptance environment can only exchange events with other apps' acceptance environments. You can check the **Space** of an app's environment on the [Event Broker Manager](https://broker.mendix.com/) page. 

**Spaces** are created and assigned based on the app environment name and allow isolation of your business events. The default behavior can be changed if needed. Please contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/) if you would like to change the **Space** of a specific app environment.

See [Enabling the Mendix Event Broker Service](#enable-mx-event-broker) for more information.

#### 3.1.2 Mendix Event Broker Topics and Channels

Events are placed in Channels, sometimes called Topics. Apps subscribed to a channel will receive events published to this channel.

Events published by Free Apps are published to one shared company channel on a multi-tenant free Event Broker. Events published by apps running on licensed nodes are published to their own channels on the company Event Broker. These channels, implemented as topics on Kafka, are automatically created upon deployment of the app publishing the events.

#### 3.1.3 Mendix Event Broker Error Handling

Event publishing is part of the transaction where the publishing occurs. This means that if you decide that something has gone wrong in your microflow logic, and you roll back all changes, the publishing of your events is also rolled back. No event will be sent to other apps.

This is implemented as follows: 
* Events published are stored in a temporary entity table
* When your transactions are completed successfully, the events will be delivered to the Mendix Event Broker
* If the publishing microflow fails and changes are rolled back, this also includes published events

## 4 Configuration

To publish or consume business events, download and import the [Mendix Business Events](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/202649) module, then right-click on the **App Explorer** and import it into your app.

### 4.1 Configuring Local Deployments {#config-local-deployment}

To test on your development workstation, run the Event Broker on your machine using Docker. The required configuration can be found in the [local setup for the event broker tool](https://github.com/mendix/event-broker-tools).

For local deployment, you need to set the **ChannelName** and **ServerUrl** constants. These constants are best configured by going to **App Settings** > **Configuration**. Click **New**, and in the **Constants** tab, you can set the required values.

Set the constants as follows:

* **ChannelName**: `local`
* **ServerUrl**: 
     * On Windows: `localhost:9092`
     * Running Docker on MacOS and Studio Pro on Windows via Parallels: `10.211.55.2:9094`
     * Running Docker on Linux and Studio Pro on Windows via VirtualBox/KVM: `<IP ADDRESS>:9094`

### 4.2 Changing Logging Interval (Optional)

Optionally you can set **SummaryLogIntervalSeconds** to a different value. The default value 120, which means if events are consumed or produced, an overview of what was consumed or produced will be logged at `INFO` level every 120 seconds. When configured with 0 or a negative number, this additional logging will not take place at all.

## 5 Usage

This section explains how to publish and consume business events in Mendix apps using the Mendix Business Events module.

### 5.1 Publishing Business Events {#publish-be}

The following sections describe how to publish entities as business events.

#### 5.1.1 Modelling Business Events

Business events are defined using entities specializing the **PublishedBusinessEvent** entity that is included in the Mendix Business Events module. 

1.  In your [Domain Model](/studio/domain-models/), double-click the entity you want to publish as a business event to display the entity properties.
2.  In the **Generalization** field, click **Select** and select the **PublishedBusinessEvent** entity. 

The base values for your entity are taken from the **PublishedBusinessEvent**, and your entity will behave like a specialized entity. For more information, see [Generalization, Specializations and Inheritance](/refguide/generalization-and-association/).

The text with the blue background above the entity tells you that it is a specialized entity based on the **PublishedBusinessEvent** entity in the **BusinessEvents** module:
{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/business-events/specialized-entity.png" >}}

#### 5.1.2 Creating a Published Business Event Service {#create-be}

A **Published Business Event Service** contains a definition of the business events provided by this service. A contract can be exported from the published service, to inform other developers what the published business event service provides. This is similar to a OpenAPI or WSDL contract.

1.  Right-click on the module folder, hover over **Add other**, and click **Published Business Event Service**.

2.  Provide the name for your service and **OK** to create it.
   
3.  If needed, select an **Event Name Prefix**. Use this to distinguish events from other ones in your company, like in a different department. This ensures that your events are uniquely named. This field is empty by default. 

4.  Once you have the Service created, click **Add** to link your modelled **PublishedBusinessEvent** entity as an event.

5.  Select the entity that you would like to publish to add it to the service.

6.  Once you have all of your entities linked into the **Published Business Event Service**, export it to be shared as an AsyncAPI contract in YAML format.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When deploying an app with one or more **Published Business Event** services, channels will be created in the Mendix Event Broker for every event part of the service. (This works similarly to how tables are created in a database for persistable entities.) If you reuse a module with published events in multiple apps, multiple independent channels will be created. Apps interested in receiving events will need to subscribe to every event or channel independently. 
{{% /alert %}}

#### 5.1.3 Using the Publish Business Event Activity

After defining your business events, and adding them to a published service, you can publish the events in your microflows whenever a noticeable event occurs. You do this using the **Publish business event** activity:

1.  Open the microflow in which the business events will be published.
2.  Create an object of the business events you want to publish.
3.  In the **Toolbox**, search for the **Publish business event** action and drag it and place it in your microflow.
4.  Double-click **Publish business event** to display the **Publish Business Event** property box.
5.  Enter the following information:
    * **Subject**: This can be anything you consider useful, like a short description of what can be expected in the payload, similar to email subject. It will help subscribed apps decide if the event might be useful to them.
    * **Event Data**: Select the entity that you want to publish in the service that will represent the Business event in the subscribers app. This should be an entity that you have configured to inherit from the **PublishedBusinessEvent** entity in step 1.
    * **Task Queue/Output:** These values are not currently used for Business Events and should be left unchanged.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The *Publish Business Event* Activity will commit all event objects at the start of the publishing process as an **Outbox** entity. This is an implementation detail. In case something goes wrong during the publishing process, a retry mechanism will be triggered for up to 48 hours.  If the publishing microflow fails, the entity in the **Outbox** will be rolled back as well. See the [Business Event Entities](#be-entities) section for more information on the **Outbox** entity.
{{% /alert %}}

### 5.2 Consuming Business Events {#consume-be}

To receive or consume business events, an application needs to subscribe to one or more business events and define which microflow is responsible for handle the event received. 

This is done in a reliable way: if the receiving app is unavailable the event will be delivered once the app is available. If the microflow handling the event fails, it will be retried.

#### 5.2.1 Create a Consumed Business Event Service

To start consuming a business event contract, you first need to create a **Consumed Business Event Service**.

1.  Right-click on the module folder, hover over **Add other**, then click **Consumed Business Event Service**.

2.  Provide the name for your service.

3.  Import a AsyncAPI service contract. Click **Browse** and select the YAML file (created in the [Create a Published Business Event Service](#create-be) step). This will make subscriptions to business events available for you to start mapping to entities within your consuming application.

4.  Click **OK**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/business-events/subscriptions-available-2.png" >}}

##### 5.2.1.1 Automatically Created Event Handler Microflow and Entity

There are two ways to subscribe to, or consume a specific business event:
* **Add** the subscription in the **subscribed business event service**.
* **Drag and drop** the business event from the **Data Hub pane** to your domain model

When you click **Add** to add the events from the Contract into your module, Studio Pro will automatically create an entity within your domain model and an **Event Handler** microflow to manage the flow of the Event after delivery. The **Event Handler** microflow is created in the same directory as your service.

You can use the payload of the event as an entity:
{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/business-events/payload-event-entity-2.png" >}}

The handler microflow attached to it triggers each event where you can build your business logic:
{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/business-events/payload-event-entity-3.png" >}}

#### 5.3 Business Event Entities {#be-entities}

The **PublishedBusinessEvent** and **ConsumedBusinessEvent** entities are necessary to include in your domain model to publish business events. The **DeadLetterQueue** and **Outbox** are part of the Mendix Business Events module.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/business-events/four-entities-in-domain-model.png" >}}

* **PublishedBusinessEvent**: This non-persistable entity has the fields settings that every published event will include. Every published business event will inherit from this entity. The three fields can be set from the Java Action. This is used to define what your published business events look like.
 
* **ConsumedBusinessEvent**: This entity has the fields that every consumed event will include. Every consumed business event will inherit from this entity. These fields will be set from the module, as will any additional fields that match with the payload of the event. This defines what you want to receive from the business events you subscribe to.

* **DeadLetterQueue**: This persistant entity within the Domain Model of the Business Events Module is used for generating a historical record of events that are generated for business event activities that were not successful or had errors when received by the consumer and can be referred to for troubleshooting. You can query the DeadLetterQueue entity to determine which received events could not be processed.

* **Outbox**: This entity is used to store the event prior to being sent.  This entity is connected to the microflow where a Business event is triggered.  Should the Microflow fail, the entity will be removed as part of the same transaction.

### 5.3.1 Dead Letter Queue for Failed Messages {#dead-letter-queue}

Every time a business event is consumed, it is transformed to match the Entity created as part of the Subscription. When the Entity within the Business Event has changed based on the imported contract, it can render the Entity unable to be processed. In such a scenario the Business Event will fail into a **Dead Letter Queue** which contains the representation of the Entity within the data column.

The most important fields in this entity to be checked when there are errors include the following:

* `type`
* `source`
* `subject`
* `data` 

Use these fields to transform the payload back into a Mendix entity again. If the subject is missing from the original event, the value will be an empty string. If the consumed event does not have the correct format, the event will not go to the Dead Letter Queue, but will throw an error.

## 6 Deployment {#deployment}

Business Events offers three different deployment models:
1. Deploy locally with the [Local Setup Tool](https://github.com/mendix/event-broker-tools)
2. Free apps use a free multi-tenant Event Broker
3. Production apps use the [Mendix Event Broker](#mendix-event-broker) running in the Mendix Cloud

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Currently, business events can only be deployed to the [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/), with other deployment models expected in forthcoming releases.{{% /alert %}} 

### 6.1 Local Deployment

Use our [Local Setup Tool](https://github.com/mendix/event-broker-tools) for local deployments. See [Using the Business Events Local Setup Tool](#local-setup).

When you deploy your apps to the free cluster, a free event broker is provided and configured automatically. In the Mendix Free App environment, there is a limit of 1000 events per app per day.

### 6.2 Free Apps Deployment

When you deploy your apps to the free cluster, a free event broker is provided and configured automatically. In the Mendix Free App environment, there is a limit of 1000 events per app per day. 

Any free app in your organization will be able to receive any event published by a free app in your organization, as all free apps share a single free channel for your company.

### 6.3 Production Deployment

To deploy to production, you must have a subscription to the [Mendix Event Broker](#mendix-event-broker). See [Mendix Event Broker License](#event-broker-license) for licensing information.

You can also use your own event broker cluster.

## 7 Local Testing {#local-testing}

For development and testing it may be useful to run all your apps on your local workstation, including the Event Broker. You can do this by creating an event broker, a Kafka cluster, on your workstation by running Kafka through `docker-compose`.

### 7.1 Using the Business Events Local Setup Tool {#local-setup}

The Mendix Business Events [Local Setup Tool](https://github.com/mendix/event-broker-tools) helps you deploy locally by setting up a Docker container with Kafka. This repository includes the required `docker-compose.yml` file.
  
Start your docker cluster using the command `docker-compose up`. This will download or update all the required docker images and start Kafka.

### 7.2 Using PostgreSQL Database (Optional) {#postgres-db}

You can configure the app running in Studio Pro to use the postgres database created using docker. Remember to use a different database name for every app.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/modules/business-events/postgres.png" >}}

Here is an example of postgres service that you can add to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

``` yml
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: cspdb-dev
      POSTGRES_USER: mendix
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mendix
      PGPASSWORD: mendix
    ports:
      - "25432:5432"
```

## 8 Frequently Asked Questions

1. Can I undo a Publish Event action in case my microflow fails?

   Yes. If you do a rollback in an error handler, the business event will not be sent to other applications.

2. Can I publish my own events from other software directly to a Kafka topic?

   No, that is currently not supported. 

3. Can I send related or associated objects as a single business event?

   No, only a flat object. For complex data structures, provide an API where the consuming app can retrieve the complex structure upon retrieval of a Business Event. Alternatively, you can use a string attribute in the Business Event to store JSON or XML using mappings.

4.  I want to replicate data between my Mendix apps. Should I use business events?

    Business events can help you replicate data more efficiently by ensuring you do not have to poll continuously. Instead, the consuming app only polls for new data if it receives a business event indicating that something has changed.  To share data, it is still preferable to use OData or RESTful APIs, as this is not the current purpose of business events.

5.  Are business events guaranteed to be delivered only once?

    The **Outbox** will publish each business event only once.  This does not prevent business logic from sending duplicate messages to the [Outbox](#be-entities). 

6.  Are business events guaranteed to be delivered in the original sequence?

    Events will be delivered in the sequence they are produced. The Mendix Business Events module, however, persists the event to the **Entity** table in this order. Once the entity is persisted it triggers the microflow for the persisted entity. A failure in the microflow can cause data to become out of sequence. Event ordering is not currently a feature of the Mendix Business Event module.

7.  How do I detect and correct failed processing of received events?

    The Mendix Business Events module uses [Task Queue](/refguide/task-queue/) to publish and consume events, so all the capabilities of observability of task queue can be used here as well.

8.  How do I configure which Kafka cluster to use?

    During modelling, you can use the **Constants** described in the [Configuring Local Deployments](#config-local-deployment) section to configure to a local or other Kafka. This does not transfer through to runtime. During runtime, the configurations are provided during startup automatically, since only Mendix Cloud is supported.

9.  How do I delete or clean up events and tasks?

    This will be implemented in a forthcoming release. In the meantime, you could use scheduled event to clean up the events yourself (make sure the consumer doesn’t need them anymore). For the task queue, the **Task Queue Helpers**, a module linked in [Task Queue](/refguide/task-queue/), can be used.

10. How do I know the event was successfully published?

    Messages are first queued within the **Outbox** for successful delivery as a business event.  Monitoring the **Outbox** entity will allow the developer to determine if there are unpublished business event entities. See the [Business Event Entities](#be-entities) for more information on the **Outbox**.
 
11. How do I know events are consumed successfully?

    The flow of events are controlled by the persistence of the event to the **Consumed Business Event** entity (see [Business Event Entities](#be-entities)).  The flow will not continue in the case of such a failure.   They only cause for such failure would be database-related and unlikely to occur.

    On the microflow, a log message action can be added after the start action in order to track the movement. Refer to the [Dead Letter Queue for Failed Messages](#dead-letter-queue) section for more information.
