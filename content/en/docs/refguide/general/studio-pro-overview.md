## 1 Introduction

Mendix Studio Pro is a tool for creating, viewing, and editing your Mendix applications.

One Studio Pro instance can have only one app open at a time, but you can open two Studio Pro instances when necessary.

This document describes the user interface of Mendix Studio Pro:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/studio-pro-overview/studio-pro-diagram.png" alt="Studio Pro Diagram" >}}

## 2 Top Bar {#top-bar}

The Studio Pro top bar contains the following items:

* [Menus](#menus) 
* [Buttons to run and view your app](#run-and-view)
* [Links to the Developer Portal and Marketplace](#links) 

### 2.1 Menus {#menus}

In the Studio Pro top bar, you can see several menus, such as **Switch-to** menu, [Edit](/refguide/edit-menu/), [View](/refguide/view-menu/), and [Version Control](/refguide/version-control-menu/). Each menu contains menu items that allow you to perform various actions, for example, to [create a deployment package](/refguide/create-deployment-package-dialog/), set [preferences](/refguide/preferences-dialog/), or view the [**Errors**](/refguide/errors-pane/) pane. 

For more information on menus, see [Menus](/refguide/menus/). 

### 2.2 Run and View App {#run-and-view}

You can deploy your app by clicking the **Publish** or play (**Run locally**) buttons. To view your deployed app, click **View App**. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/studio-pro-overview/view-and-publish.png" alt="View and Publish buttons" >}}

For more information on deployment in Mendix, see [Deployment](/developerportal/deploy/).

For more information on deploying your app and versioning it, see the [Versioning an App Deployed to the Cloud](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/#versioning-app) section in *Using Version Control in Studio Pro*. 

### 2.3 Links and User Profile Menu {#links}

You can find links to the [Developer Portal](/developerportal/) and [Marketplace](/appstore/) in the upper-right corner of Studio Pro.

Your profile picture is displayed next to them if you are signed in. When you click the profile picture, the drop-down menu is displayed with your full name and email, as well as links to your user profile, My Apps screen, and signing out option. 

## 3 App Structure (App Explorer)

An app consists of individual files (*documents*) and settings that are grouped in folders and [modules](/refguide/modules/). The complete structure of your app can be viewed in the [App Explorer](/refguide/app-explorer/). 

## 4 Working Area {#working-area}

A working area is a current document tab that you work in. The working area and its settings differs depending on the editor (for example, pages, microflows, domain model editors) and type of the document. 

### 4.1 Document Tabs {#documents}

The documents you view and edit are shown in tabs. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This section describes documents in the working area, not panes that you can open and position around the working area. For more information on behavior of panes, see the [Layout of Panes](/refguide/view-menu/#layout-of-panes) section in *View Menu*.
{{% /alert %}}

You can have a number of tabs open, just like in a modern web browser. They can be closed, reordered, and shown side by side. 

Each document has its own save state, history, and future, so undo and redo actions are unlimited.

## 5 Dockable Panes {#panes}

Dockable panes can be positioned around the working area and contain various elements and settings:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/studio-pro-overview/pane-example.png" alt="Properties Pane Example" width="300" >}}

For example, you can view [list of errors](/refguide/errors-pane/) or run [MxAssist Best Practice bot](/refguide/mx-assist-performance-bot/), configure properties of a specific document or an element, view toolbox. For more information on panes and their layout, see [View Menu](/refguide/view-menu/).

## 6 Status Bar {#status-bar}

At the bottom of the Studio Pro main window pane is a status bar. On the left is the current status of Studio Pro:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/studio-pro-overview/status-bar.png" alt="Status Bar Example" >}}

On the right is the currently selected language. If you have set up multiple languages in your app you can change the currently selected language by clicking here. For more information see [Language Menu](/refguide/translatable-texts/).

## 7 Shortcut Keys {#shortcuts}

This section summarizes the shortcut keys available in Studio Pro. It is divided into sections which indicate where you can use the keys.

### 7.1 General Shortcut Keys

These keys are available in multiple places within Studio Pro and work generically.

#### 7.1.1 Panes and Editors

These keys are active within the [Dockable Panes](#panes) and editors, such as the Domain Model, Pages, Workflows, Microflows, or the Navigation editor.

##### 7.1.1.1 All Panes and Editors

You can navigate between Studio Pro panes (for example, the domain model editor or the **Errors** pane) using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + (<kbd>Shift</kbd>) + <kbd>Tab</kbd>. This opens a selection dialog where you can choose a pane using the mouse, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + (<kbd>Shift</kbd>) + <kbd>Tab</kbd>. You are taken to the selected pane when you click the main mouse button or release the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.
