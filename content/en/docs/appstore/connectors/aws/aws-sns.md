## 1 Introduction
 
The [Amazon SNS connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/204715) provides a way for you to enrich your Mendix app with app-to-app and app-to-person notifications by implementing [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).
 
### 1.1 Typical Use Cases
 
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) can send app-to-app (A2A) and app-to-person (A2P) notifications. The A2A functionality provides high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. These applications include Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Lambda, and other HTTPS endpoints. The A2P functionality lets you send messages to your customers with SMS, push notifications, and email.
 
### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
 
The Amazon SNS connector requires Mendix Studio Pro 9.18.0 or above.
 
To authenticate with Amazon Web Service (AWS), you must also install and configure the [AWS authentication connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333). The Amazon SNS Connector version 3.0.0 and newer require at least version 3.0 of the AWS Authentication Connector. For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).
 
{{% alert color="info" %}}
Ensure that the AWS user account used for authentication has the appropriate permissions to access the SNS service in AWS.

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Installation
 
Follow the instructions in [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/overview/use-content/) to import the Amazon SNS connector into your app.
 
## 3 Configuration
 
After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonSNSConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon SNS. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.
 
### 3.1 Configuring AWS Authentication
 
In order to use the Amazon SNS service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

As of version 3.0.0 of the [AWS Authentication Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333), all the resources and logic required to set up authentication are centralized inside the AWS Authentication Connector module. 

The AWS Authentication Connector supports both **static credentials** and **temporary credentials**. For more information and detailed instructions please refer to the [AWS Authentication Connector documentation page](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).
 
### 3.2 Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After you configure the authentication profile for Amazon SNS, you can implement the functions of the connector by using the provided activities in microflows.

#### 3.2.1 Subscribing to a Topic

To subscribe to a topic in your AWS environment and receive email notifications from it, implement the [Subscribe](#subscribe) activity by performing the following steps:

1. In the **App Explorer**, right-click the name of your module, and then click **Add microflow**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-sns/sns_create_microflow.png" alt="Adding a microflow">}}

| Name | Generalization | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ListTopicsResponse` | | This entity is the response for the Amazon SNS `ListTopics` action. It holds a list of ListTopicsTopic objects. |
| `ListTopicsTopic` | `AmazonSNSConnector.Topic` | This entity holds information on the retrieved topic. The attributes it contains are **ARN**, which reflects the name of the resource inside the Amazon environment, and **Name**, which reflects the name of the topic. |
 
#### 4.3.4 PublishBatch {#publish-batch}
 
The `Publish` Amazon SNS action allows you to publish up to 10 messages to all those subscribed to a given topic.  It requires a valid AWS Region and a PublishRequest object, containing a Topic object that can contain up to 10 message objects. The output of the action is a `PublishBatchResponse` object containing information on whether or not the messages was successfully delivered to the SNS topic.
 
The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:
 
| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `ENUM_Region (Enumeration)` | `PublishBatchResponse` |
| `PublishRequest (Object)` | 
| `Credentials (Object)` | |

#### 4.3.5 Subscribe {#subscribe}
 
To receive messages published to a topic, you must subscribe an endpoint to the topic. When you subscribe an endpoint to a topic, the endpoint begins to receive messages published to the associated topic. The supported endpoint types are email, json-email, SMS, and URL.

Before messages are sent, the subscription might have to be confirmed. For email-type endpoints, this requires the end-user to click the confirmation link in an email. For URL-type endpoints, a short-lived token is sent to the endpoint. This token has to be used in the `ConfirmSubscription` action. For more information, see [Subscribing to an Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html).

A Filter Policy can also be set on a subscription to filter on the messages the subscription will receive. For more information, see [Amazon SNS message filtering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-filtering.html) and [Filter policy constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/subscription-filter-policy-constraints.html).
