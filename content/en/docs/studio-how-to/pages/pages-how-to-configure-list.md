{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/master-details.png" >}} 

## 4 Configuring the List

The page is created, now you need to configure it. First of all, you need to connect data to the list. Do the following:

1. Select the list view and click the **Entity** option in its properties:

	{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/list-view-entity.png" alt="List View Properties"   width="250"  >}}

2. In the **Select Entity** dialog box, select **OpportunityContact** and confirm your choice by clicking **Select**. Now the list is connected to the **OpportunityContact** entity. 

3. To display the name of each report per company, do the following:

    1. Select the **Name** text in the list view and open the **Properties** tab.

    	{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/text.png"   width="300"  >}}

    2. In the **Content** property, delete *Name* and click **Add** > **Attribute**:

    	{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/text-content.png" >}}

    3. In the **Select Attribute** dialog box, choose **Name** and click **Select**. 

4. Delete the image from the list and the column where this image is placed, as now the image displays a a user image that does not correspond to opportunity contacts you are displaying.
    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/list-with-no-image.png"   width="300"  >}}

5. As the goal of the new page is to merely display data, delete the **New** button above the list view together with the container it is placed in:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/container.png"   width="300"  >}}

Now the list view will display the list of opportunity contacts by their name:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/list-configured.png" alt="Configured List"   width="300"  >}} 

## 5 Configuring Report Details

Now you need to configure opportunity contact details displayed next to the list. The idea is when you select the name from the list, the details of the selected contact will be displayed. 

The Master Details page template which your page is based on has a preconfigured data view that listens to the list view. That means that the data view shows data of the opportunity contact selected in the list view . 

Now you need to configure widgets inside the data view to show attributes of the *InspectionReport* entity, or in other words to show all the details that an opportunity contact has, such as title, name, job title, phone, email. 

To displayed all the details that a contact has, do the following:

1. Delete the empty column and **Edit**, **Send Email**, and **Delete** buttons inside the data view as you will only display data, not change it:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/data-view-buttons.png" >}}

2. Double-click the *User Details* text widget (which is displayed as a data view heading) and rename it to *Opportunity Contact Details*. 

3. Open the **Toolbox** and search for **Radio Buttons**, drag and drop it *inside* the data view above the **Name** text box.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/radio-buttons.png" >}}

4. Open radio buttons properties and click **Data Source** > **Attribute**.

5. In the **Select Attribute** dialog box, choose **Title** and click **Select**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/title.png"   width="400"  >}}

6. Select the **Name** text box and click **Data Source** > **Attribute** in its properties. 

7. In the **Select Attribute** dialog box, choose **Name** and click **Select**.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to set the **Phone** attribute for the **Phonenumber** text box, the **Email** attribute for the **Email** text box, **DateCreated**  for the **Birthday** text box, and **EstimatedValue** for the **Bio** text box. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/attributes-replaced.png" >}}

9. You lack information on the contact's job title and status. To add the job title information, open the **Toolbox**, search for a **Text Box**, drag and drop it inside the data view below the **Name** text box:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/job-title-text-box.png" >}}

10. Open text box properties and click **Data Source** > **Attribute**. 

11. In the **Select Attribute** dialog box, choose **JobTitle** and click **Select**.

12. To add the information on the opportunity contact's status, open the **Toolbox**, search for for **Radio Buttons**, drag and drop it inside the data view below the **Estimated Value** text box.

13. Open the radio buttons properties and click **Data Source** > **Attribute**.

14. In the **Select Attribute** dialog box, choose **Status** and click **Select**.

Congratulations! You have a page that displays a list of opportunity contacts and the details of the selected contact:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/pages/pages-how-to-configure-list/configured-page.png" alt="Configured Page" >}}

You can now preview your app and test your page. For more information on how to preview your page, see [Previewing & Publishing Your App](/studio/publishing-app/).

You can also work on the page details, for example, add a dynamic image to the list to display a profile picture of an opportunity contact next to their name. For more information on dynamic images, see [Images & Files](/studio/page-editor-widgets-images-and-files/).
