## Introduction

The Profile API is an [App Service](/refguide6/consumed-app-services) that allows your AppCloud applications to retrieve profile information of their users from the Mendix Platform.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

The Profile API will require the EnvironmentUUID and EnvironmentPassword parameters to authenticate and authorize requests. The values for these should come from constants from the AppCloudServices module with the same name. The Mendix Developer Portal will automatically set these constants, you do not need to set these yourself. For this reason, the Profile API will only function for applications that use the AppCloudServices module and are deployed through the Mendix Developer Portal.

The service is part of the [AppCloudServices module](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/934/Mendix/AppCloudServices), which is available from the App Store. It is also included in the default themes when creating a new application. Both of these options include a default implementation of the Profile API.

When importing version 1.3.0 of the AppCloudServices module over earlier versions, you need to replace existing calls to AppCloudServices.RetrieveDisplayName with calls to AppCloudServices.RetrieveUserProfile. This new microflow returns a new entity (UserProfile) that contains, besides the Display Name that was already returned, a lot of other fields, e.g. Email Address, Company Name, and Avatar URL. Because the old microflow has been removed, the modeler will generate errors where the old microflow was used. You can replace those occurrences with calls to the new microflow.

If you previously deployed your app with an older version of the AppCloudServices module, you will need to update the value of the "AppCloudServices.ProfileServiceLocation" constant in the Developer Portal on first re-deployment. The new value should be "[https://profile.mendixcloud.com/ws/ProfileService/3/soap1](https://profile.mendixcloud.com/ws/ProfileService/3/soap1)".

Note that a request will return a [non-persistable object](/refguide6/persistability). It's up to the implementer of the Profile API to store the received profile data in the database.
