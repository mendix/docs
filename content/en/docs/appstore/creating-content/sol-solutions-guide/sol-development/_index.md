## 1 Introduction

This section provides information and best practices on how to develop solutions on the Mendix Platform that are ready to be sold on the Mendix Marketplace.

While [Mendix best practices for development](/howto/general/dev-best-practices/) apply, there are additional considerations when architecting and developing a Mendix solution. The overview of [Architecting Adaptive Solutions](/appstore/creating-content/sol-architecting/) is a good starting point. 

Then, continue reading about [Applying IP Protection](/appstore/creating-content/sol-ip-protection/) to make your solution ready to sell to customers.
