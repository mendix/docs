## 1 Introduction

When you first start a Mendix hybrid mobile app for iOS, the feedback button doess not work, due to an iOS security policy  whereby the application is only allowed to make requests and load content from `file:///` URLs. Because the content in the feedback widget is hosted at `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com`, the widget does not work 

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Configure your hybrid mobile app to allow access to the Developer Portal feedback portal in your iOS hybrid app

## 2 Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have access to the Developer Portal and the **Custom Phonegap/Cordova configuration** section on the **Mobile App** page (accessible via **DEPLOY**)
* Alternatively, you can make this change directly in the *config.xml* file, if you have that available

## 3 Extending the config.xml File

To make the feedback button work as it should, you need only to add two lines to your PhoneGap *config.xml* file inside the `<widget>` element:

```xml
<!-- Don't block any requests -->
<access origin="*" />
<!-- Allow links to sprintr.home.mendix.com -->
<allow-navigation href="https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/*" />
```

Now build your appliaction and you will see a correctly rendered feedback widget!
