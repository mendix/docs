## 1 Introduction

An exclusive split is an element that makes a choice based on a condition and follows (exactly) one of the outgoing sequence flows.

## 2 Action Properties

### 2.1 Type

Type defines whether an expression or a rule is used to define the condition of the split.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Expression | An expression is used to define the conditions for the direction. |
| Rule | A rule is used to define the conditions for the direction. |

### 2.2 Expression

If the property 'Type' is set to 'Expression' the expression field can be used to define the condition of the split. The condition can be entered as an [expression](expressions). The expression should result in a boolean or an enumeration.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

If you want to open a different order form per member type you can use an exclusive split. The selected customer is a parameter with name SelectedCustomer to the microflow. For each enumeration value a different sequence flow is followed. If the enumeration has no value the sequence flow with the caption (empty) is followed.

The expression entered is given below. Because you want to go a different direction for each enumeration you can suffice by just stating the attribute.
`$SelectedCustomer/memberType`

{{% /alert %}}

### 2.3 Rule

If the property 'Type' is set to 'Rule', a [rule](rules) can be selected to define the condition of the split. For each parameter of the rule an argument needs to be specified using [expressions](expressions). For example, a rule that determines whether a customer deserves a certain status will have a customer object as a parameter.
