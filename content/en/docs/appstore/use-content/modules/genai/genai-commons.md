## Introduction {#introduction}

The [GenAI Commons](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/227933) module combines common GenAI patterns found in a variety of generative AI models on the market. Platform-supported GenAI-connectors use the underlying data structures and their operations. This makes it easier to develop vendor agnostic AI-enhanced apps with Mendix, for example by using one of the connectors or the [Conversational UI](/appstore/modules/genai/conversational-ui/) module.

If two different connectors both adhere to the GenAI Commons module, they can be easily swapped, which reduces dependency on the model providers. In addition, the initial implementation of AI capabilities using the connectors becomes a drag and drop experience, so that developers can quickly get started. The module exposes useful operations which developers can use to build a request to a large language model (LLM), and to handle the response.

Developers who want to connect to another LLM provider or their own service are advised to use the GenAI Commons module as well. This speeds up the development and ensures that common principles are taken into account. Lastly, other developers or consumers of the connector can adapt to it more quickly.

### Limitations {#limitations}

The current scope of the module is focused on text and image generation, as well as embeddings and knowledgebase use cases.

### Dependencies {#dependencies}

The GenAI Commons module requires Mendix Studio Pro version [9.24.2](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.24/#9242) or above.

You must also download the [Community Commons](/appstore/modules/community-commons-function-library/) module.

## Installation {#installation}

If you are starting from the [Blank GenAI app](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/227934), or the [AI Bot Starter App](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/227926), the GenAI Commons module is included and does not need to be downloaded manually.

If you start from a blank app, or have an existing project where you want to include a connector for which the GenAI Commons module is a required module, you must install GenAI Commons manually. First, install the [Community commons](/appstore/modules/community-commons-function-library/) module, and then follow the instructions in [using Marketplace content](/appstore/use-content/) to import the GenAI Commons module into your app.

## Implementation {#implementation}

GenAI Commons is the foundation of chat completion implementations within the [OpenAI connector](/appstore/modules/genai/openai/) and the [Amazon Bedrock connector](/appstore/modules/genai/bedrock/), but may also be used to build other GenAI service implementations on top of it by reusing the provided domain model and exposed microflows.

Although GenAI Commons technically defines additional capabilities typically found in chat completion APIs, such as image processing (vision) and tools (function calling), it depends on the connector module of choice for whether these are actually implemented and supported by the LLM. To learn which additional capabilities a connector supports and for which models these can be used, refer to the documentation of that connector.

The GenAI Commons module is [protected](/refguide/consume-add-on-modules-and-solutions/), which means that it cannot be changed and the logic of the microflows is not visible. For information about what each exposed operation does, see [Microflows](#microflows), or refer to the documentation inside the module.

### Token Usage

GenAI Commons can help store usage data which allows admins to understand the token usage. Usage data is only persisted if the constant `StoreUsageMetrics` is set to `true` and the GenAI connector of choice has implemented the operation to store token usage. In general, this is only supported for chat completions and embeddings operations.

To clean up usage data in a deployed app, you can enable the daily scheduled event `ScE_Usage_Cleanup` in the Mendix Cloud Portal. Use the `Usage_CleanUpAfterDays` constant to control for how long token usage data should be persisted. 

Lasty, the [Conversational UI module](/appstore/modules/genai/conversational-ui/) provides pages, snippets and logic to display and export token usage information. For this to work, the module roles `UsageMonitoring` from both Conversational UI as well as GenAI Commons need to be assigned to the applicable project roles.

## Technical Reference {#technical-reference}

The technical purpose of GenAI Commons module is to define a common domain model for generative AI use cases in Mendix applications. To help you work with the **GenAI Commons** module, the following sections list the available [entities](#domain-model), [enumerations](#enumerations), and [microflows](#microflows) that you can use in your application. 

### Domain Model {#domain-model} 

The domain model in Mendix is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. For more general information, see the [Domain Model](/refguide/domain-model/) documentation. To learn about where the entities from the domain model are used and relevant during implementation, see the [Microflows](#microflows) section below.

#### Text and Files: Chat Completions Interface {#chat-completions-interface}

The [OpenAI connector](/appstore/modules/genai/openai/) and the [Amazon Bedrock connector](/appstore/modules/genai/bedrock/) both have two chat completions and image generations operations implemented that share the same interface, meaning that they expect the same entities as input and as output. This has the advantage that these operations can be exchanged very easily without much additional development effort.

We recommend that you adapt to the same interface when developing custom chat completions or image generations operations, such as integration with different AI providers. The generic interfaces are described below. For more detailed information, refer to the documentation of the connector that you want to use, since it may expect specializations of the generic GenAI common entities as an input.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
These operations are not implemented in this module. The module only describes the interface (microflow input parameters, return value, and expected behavior), and it is up to connectors that adhere to the principles of GenAI Commons to provide an implementation. For an implementation example, see the respective sections in the [OpenAI connector](/appstore/modules/genai/openai/) or the [Amazon Bedrock Connector](/appstore/modules/genai/bedrock/), or take a look at the [showcase app](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475) where both connectors are implemented to decide at runtime whether to call the LLM through OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock.

#### Knowledge Bases and Embeddings: Embeddings Interface {#embeddings-interface}

To make use of embeddings in a Mendix app, GenAI Commons defines interfaces for embedding operations that connectors can adhere to. We recommend that you adapt to the same interface when developing custom embedding operations, such as integration with different AI providers. The generic interfaces are described below. For more detailed information, refer to the documentation of the connector that you want to use, since it may expect specializations of the generic GenAI common entities as an input.

##### Embeddings (String)

The `Embeddings (String)` operation interface allows the invocation of the embeddings API with a String input and returns an `EmbeddingsResponse` object with token usage statistics, if applicable. The `EmbeddingsResponse_GetFirstVector` microflow from GenAI Commons can be used to retrieve the corresponding embedding vector in a String representation. This operation supports scenarios where the vector embedding of a single string must be generated, e.g. to perform a nearest neighbor search across an existing knowledge base. 

###### Input Parameters

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| `InputText` | String | mandatory | Input text to create the embedding vector for. |
| `Connection` | [Connection](#connection) | mandatory | Connection object that contains the required endpoint details and API credentials. Depending on the connector module, a specific specialization must be passed. |

###### Return Value

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EmbeddingsResponse` | [EmbeddingsResponse](#embeddingsresponse-entity) | A response object that contains the token usage statistics and the corresponding embedding vector as part of a ChunkCollection |

##### Embeddings (ChunkCollection)

The `Embeddings (ChunkCollection)` operation interface allows the invocation of an embeddings API with a [ChunkCollection](#chunkcollection) and returns an [EmbeddingsResponse](#embeddingsresponse-entity) object with token usage statistics, if applicable. The response object is associated with the original [ChunkCollection](#chunkcollection) used as an input, and the [Chunk](#chunk-entity) (or [KnowledgeBaseChunk](#knowledgebasechunk-entity)) objects will be updated with their corresponding embedding vector retrieved from the Embeddings API within this microflow.

###### Input Parameters

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| `ChunkCollection` | [ChunkCollection](#chunkcollection) | mandatory | A ChunkCollection with Chunks for which an embedding vector should be generated. Use operations from GenAI commons to create a ChunkCollection and add Chunks or KnowledgeBaseChunks to it. |
