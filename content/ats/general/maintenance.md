## Maintenance Window

The time window, where planned system maintenance can occur, is weekly on Tuesday between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. (CET).

The users are informed with a notification in ATS about the planned maintenance. ATS is not available during maintenance. All users are logged out and all running tests are canceled. Schedules and CI/CD are disabled during maintenance as well.

There is a notification after maintenance, showing the made changes.

Maintenance for fixing major issues can occur anytime outside the maintenance window. We will announce a downtime as early as possible.
