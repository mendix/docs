### Fixes 

* We fixed an issue where signing out from Studio Pro did not work correctly, which also caused problems with signing in again.
* We fixed an issue where an unnecessary **username and password** pop-up window was shown when the **Open App** dialog box was opened while you were not signed into Studio Pro.

### Improvements

* We made it possible to set **Localize** to **No** for date and time attributes of external entities. (Ticket 188260)
* We added support for the following [language](/refguide/language-settings/): Basque (Euskara).
* We added the ability to search in tree controls for results that contain recursiveness in their data (for example, in the **Selector** dialog box that allows you to select an entity or attribute over associations).
* We added read-only description fields in the **Add** and **Edit** dialog boxes for [business event subscriptions](/appstore/modules/business-events/).
* We improved the configuration of parameter mappings for actions and snippet calls. This prevents them from changing automatically when you add a page parameter or snippet parameter to the surrounding form, or when you change a data grid's selection mode.
* The target document of an action or snippet call no longer requires the parameter mappings to be closed and reopened to be refreshed if they have become invalid.
* We added an ability to preview images in the **Properties** pane for entity and building block images.
* We now publish the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](/refguide/open-api/) for published REST services alongside the existing OAS or Swagger 2.0 specification.
* The Swagger UI of published REST services now shows a **Choose File** button when you are using a REST operation that takes a FileDocument (or derived entity) as a parameter.
* We made the workflows behavior for user tasks more consistent. If the number of targeted users is fewer than the required number of users, then the user task will always fail.
* We updated the spacing between the toolbar control elements.
* We updated the [mx check](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/app/#check) command of the mx tool so that it refers to the rebranded **MxAssist Best Practice Bot** (formerly MxAssist Performance Bot).
* We enabled more translations of error messages generated by the Mendix Runtime. Previously, there was a fixed message displayed when object creation failed due to security reasons. Now, you can provide a translation of that error message.

### Fixes

* <a id="wo-ki-fix"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.0/#wo-ki) where the algorithm for detecting conflicts during the migration of workflows with running multi-user tasks was currently too rigid and did not allow a conflicted user task to be continued in certain cases.
* <a id="pane-ki-fix"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.0/#pane-ki) by restoring the ability to change the **Visible for** page setting from the **Properties** pane. (Ticket 189995)
* We fixed an issue where the XPath constraint of a data source produced incorrect results if the widget was placed inside a pluggable widget and the constraint used attributes from a page variable (such as `$currentObject`). (Ticket 178210)
* We fixed an issue in offline-first profiles where a failed synchronization due to committing some invalid changes did not provide sufficient information about the error in the logs or stack trace. (Tickets 183328, 186301)
* We fixed an issue where no consistency error was shown on an invalid expression in a microflow when using an association that could not be traversed. (Ticket 185701)
* We fixed the behavior of the [Pluggable Widget Filtering API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-client-apis-list-values/#listvalue-filtering) for attributes over association. Now, a filter such as `equals(attributeId, empty())` will also match if any of the associations leading up to the attribute are empty. (Ticket 186042)
* We fixed an issue where [Validation Assist](/refguide/validation-assist/) generated an incorrect validation microflow. (Ticket 186222)
* We fixed an issue that allowed for adding custom icons to native pages, as native pages do not support custom icons. (Ticket 186783)
* We fixed an error that occurred when calling `Core.http().executeHttpRequests()` from a Java action when the **Services** log level was set to **TRACE**. (Tickets 187228, 187764)
* We fixed an issue in offline applications where an association was lost if an uncommitted non-persistable entity (NPE) was used in a microflow. (Ticket 187904)
* We fixed an issue that occurred when retrieving an NPE over an association where the entity had a generalization with a calculated attribute. (Ticket 188255)
* We fixed an issue where the fallback to the default language when viewing non-default languages was not used for a [text template property](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#texttemplate) when it was linked to a data source. This resulted in empty text in the client (for example, for the dynamic text property of a data grid 2 column). (Ticket 188724, 188403)
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro crashed if you accidentally dropped a  [container widget](/refguide/container/) onto itself. (Ticket 189191)
* We fixed an issue that caused an error when deploying an app if a snippet contained a checkbox with an on-change action that used a snippet parameter. (Ticket 191010)
* We fixed an issue where the Mendix Runtime for published REST services threw an error when an operation microflow set a non-standard HTTP status code for the HTTP response.
* We fixed an issue with the request body URL encoding for [POST and PATCH requests](/refguide/published-rest-operation/) for external objects. These URLs will now be encoded in the outgoing request's body.
* We fixed accessibility issues affecting data grid filters and the search bar in the list view widget.
* We fixed an issue related to input label accessibility in [authentication widgets](/refguide/authentication-widgets/).
* We fixed an issue where the change event handler of a completed user task was not called when an incompatible workflow was continued.
* We fixed an error that caused an exception in workflow change event handling when the context object did not exist.
* We fixed an issue where an "oops" pop-up window was produced via the **Select Schema Elements** dialog box inside **Import Mapping** when an XML schema with more than two levels of children was selected.
* We fixed an issue in MxAssist Best Practice Bot where apps reported 0 recommendations for an MXP008 cached non-persistable entity.
* We fixed the error message that is returned from a published OData service when trying to perform arithmetic operations in a filter query clause. It now explicitly names the OData operands it does not support.
* We restored the ability to type from editors to the default property in the **Properties** pane.
* We fixed an issue affecting [text boxes](/refguide/text-box/) where the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key-press event was called from pop-up windows, which caused unexpected behavior.
* We fixed an issue where a tabbed editor (for example, a navigation editor) that contained a tree or grid control had its width changed when UI updates (for example, toggling a checkbox) were performed after the appearance of a scrollbar in that same tree or grid control.
* We fixed an issue affecting the background colors of combo box and toggle control UI elements.
* We fixed an issue where some data grid control cells containing hyperlinks had incorrect visual styling.
* We fixed an issue that caused an error message to be shown when closing a dialog box.
* We fixed an issue that occurred when resizing the navigation editor.
