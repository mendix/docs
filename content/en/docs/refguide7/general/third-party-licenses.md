Mendix uses various third-party libraries that have their own licenses. All the licenses are available when you download the freely available [Mendix Desktop Modeler](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/) installation. They can be found in various sub-folders of your **Mendix** installation folder:

* Runtime Server libraries can be found in the folder **runtime\lib**
* Modeler libraries can be found in the folder **modeler\Licenses**
* Client licenses can be found in the following locations:
    * **modeler\deployment.mxz** â€“ this is a *zip* file where you can navigate to **web\lib\bootstrap\css\bootstrap.css** and to **web\lib\rbootstrap\css\rbootstrap.css** for bootstrap licenses (when you deploy an app, you can also find all these files in your deployment folder)
    * **runtime\mxclientsystem\mxui.mxui.js** for the dojo license
