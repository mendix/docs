A placeholder can be used in a [layout](layout) to define a 'gap' that can be filled in a [page](page) that is based on that layout or in another layout that defines that layout as a master layout.

## Common Properties

### Name

The name of a placeholder is displayed in the center of each placeholder in the layout editor. Similarly, it will also appear in each placeholder gap of a page based on the layout, as long as the placeholder remains empty. 

The placeholder name is also used to map page contents from one layout to the other when switching layouts or creating a new page. This behavior is described in detail in the [layout](layout) reference page.
