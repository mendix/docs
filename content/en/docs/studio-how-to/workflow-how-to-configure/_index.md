## 1 Introduction 

Workflow is a visual language in Mendix Studio and Mendix Studio Pro that allows you to build extendable processes. It is fully integrated with other visual languages, such as microflow editor and page editor. 

{{% alert type="note" %}}
Workflows are available in Studio from **Mendix version 9.12.1**. If you have an app with workflows functionality below this version, this app is likely to be created in Studio Pro and requires a manual migration. For more information on how to migrate your app using Studio Pro, see [Migrate Workflow Apps](/refguide/workflow-beta-migration/). 
{{% /alert %}}

This how-to explains how to build a workflow manually, without using a wizard. For more information on using the wizard and creating workflows with its help, see the [Creating a Workflow Using the Wizard](/studio/workflows/#wizard) section in Workflows.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Enabling and creating workflows
* Configuring attributes for an entity
* Triggering the workflow from a page
* Creating user tasks for different user roles
* Configuring pages for the user tasks
* Restricting page access to the relevant user roles
* Creating a decision
* Configuring navigation
* Testing your workflow from the perspective of different users

The how-to describes the following use case: 

You would like to build an employee onboarding process. At first, an HR specialist needs to initiate the onboarding process for a new employee. The employee's manager then steps in, select devices for the employee and specify whether the new hire is working from the office or home . The Facilities department then need to prepare a workspace. Depending on where the new hire works from (the office or home), the Facilities department either prepare a desk or ship the devices to the employee's address. 

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Familiarize yourself with workflow terms. For more information, see [Workflows](/refguide/workflows/). 
* Make sure your app has Mendix version 9.12
* Make sure your app is based on the Blank app template 

## 3 Enabling Workflows {#enable-workflows}

First, you need to enable workflows for your app. Do the following:

1. Click the workflow icon in the left menu bar.

2. Before enabling workflows, you need to enable security. Click **Enable Security**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/enable-security.png" alt="Enable Security" >}}

3. After security is enabled, click **Enable Workflows**.

4. In the **Workflows Enabled** pop-up menu, click **Create Workflow**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/create-workflow.png" alt="Create Workflow" >}}

5. In the **Create Workflow** dialog box, set the **Title** to **Employee_Onboarding** and click the **Set Up Manually** button:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/set-up-manually.jpg" alt="Set Up Workflow Manually" >}}

5. Click the **Workflow Context** to create an entity that is used for the [Workflow Context parameter](/studio/workflow-parameter/), a business-related data that travels through the workflow.

6. In the **Select Entity** dialog box, click the plus icon in the upper-right corner to create a new entity.

7. In the **Create Entity** dialog box, set the **Name** to **EmployeeOnboarding** and click **Create**. 

8. Click **Create** to confirm your choice once again.

Good job! You have created a workflow and a Workflow Context parameter.

## 4 Configuring a Domain Model

In the previous section, you have created the entity that is set for the Workflow Context parameter. You now need to configure attributes for this entity. Do the following:

1. Open the [domain model](/studio/domain-models/). 
2.  The **EmployeeOnboarding** entity you have created will hold the information about the employee to onboard, as well as capture information added during execution of the workflow, such as the laptop model that the new employee requires. Add the following attributes to the **EmployeeOnboarding** entity (for more information on how to create attributes, see [Adding New Attributes](/studio/domain-models/#adding-new-attributes) section in the *Domain Model*):
    1. Add the **FullName** attribute and set the type to string.
    2. Add the **FirstDay** attribute and set its type to Date and Time.
    3. Add the **WFH** (Work from home) attribute and set its type to Boolean.
    4. Add the **PhoneModel** enumeration with the following enumeration items: iPhone, iPhone_Pro, Samsung. For more information on enumerations and how to create them, see the [Creating a New Enumeration](/studio/domain-models-enumeration/#create-new-enumeration) section in *Enumerations*.
    5. Add the **LaptopModel** enumeration with the following enumeration items: Lenovo, Mac, Dell. 

You have configured the **EmployeeOnboarding** entity:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/domain-model.png" alt="Domain Model" >}}

## 5 Configuring Security

In the [Enabling Workflows](#enable-workflows) section, you have enabled security for your app, and several roles and permissions were added automatically. However, you need to add more roles to your app: HR, Manager, and Facilities roles. Follow the steps below:

1. Open **App Settings** > **Roles and Permissions**. 
2. Click **Add Role** in the right corner.
3. Set the role's name to **HR** and click **Create**.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create **Manager** and **Facilities** roles.

Now all necessary roles are created for your app. For more information about security, see [Security, Roles & Permissions](/studio/settings-security/). 

## 6 Triggering the Workflow from a Page

To start your workflow, you need to trigger it. In this use case, the workflow is started by an HR specialist who should fill in the new hire's name, the first day, and then click the **Start Onboarding** button that will trigger the workflow. Do the following:

1. Create an **EmployeesToOnboard** page that contains a list view with the **EmployeeOnboarding** entity as its data source. (For more information on how to create a page and add widgets to it, see the [Performing Basic Functions](/studio/page-editor/#page-editor-basic-functions) section in *Pages*.)

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/employees-to-onboard-list.png" alt="Employees to Onboard List" >}}
    
2. Add a button that will initiate the workflow to the list view. Follow the steps below:

    1. Open the **Toolbox** and search for the **Call Workflow** button.

    2. Drag and drop the button inside the list view:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/start-onboarding-button.png" alt="Start Onboarding Button" >}}

    3. Open the button properties and set the **Workflow** property to **Employee_Onboarding**. 

    4. Set the **Caption** of the button to **Start Onboarding**.

3. The HR specialist also needs a page where they can fill in new hire's details. Add a **Create Object** button on the top of the page (outside the list view):

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/employees-to-onboard-page.png" alt="Employees to Onboard Page" >}}

4. Set **Entity** to **EmployeeOnboarding**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/create-object-button.png" alt="Create Object Button" >}}

5. Click the **Page** property. 

6. In the **Select Page** dialog box, click the plus icon.

7. In the **Create Page** dialog box, you can see templates for forms. Do the following:

    1. Set the **Title** to **Employee_Details**.

    2. Set the **Layout** to **PopupLayout**.

    3. Select the **Forms Columns** template.

    4. Click **Create**.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/create-employee-details-page.png" alt="Create Employee Details Page" >}}

8. The new page opens. By default all attributes are added to the form. However, the HR specialist needs to specify only the name and the first day of the new hire. Leave the relevant widgets and delete all other ones from the form:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/employee-details-form.png" alt="Employee Details Form" >}}

Good job! Now you have a page where the HR specialist can start the workflow.

## 7 Specifying Details of the New Hire {#specify-details}

The manager of a new employee will get a task to specify devices for the new hire. The manager also needs to indicate whether the new hire is working from home (WFH) or not. For this functionality you need to add activities to the workflow. Follow the steps below: 

1. Open the **Employee_Onboarding** workflow.

2. In the **Toolbox** tab, find the **User Task** activity, and drag and drop it to the workflow editor.

3. Open the user task properties. 

4. Set the **Caption** property to **Manager: Specify Employee Details** to easily see who this task should be assigned to:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/user-task-caption.png" alt="Caption" >}}

5. To create a page where the manager specifies necessary details, click the **Page** property.

6. In the **Select Page** dialog box, click the plus icon.

7. In the **Create Page** dialog box, you can see the templates for workflow pages. Do the following:

    1. Set the **Title** to **SpecifyDetails_Workflow**.

    2. Check that **Layout** is set to **Atlas_Default**.

    3. Select the **UserTask Extended** template.

    4. Click **Create**.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/create-new-page.png" alt="Create New Page" >}}

8. Now you need to make sure that only the relevant information is displayed on the **SpecifyDetails_Workflow** page. By default, all attributes are added to the data view with the employee details and can be edited. You need to leave only the attributes related to the task. You also need to make sure that the manager can change only a specific field in the form. For example, the name of the employee has been entered by the HR department, so the manager does not need to change it and should have this field as read-only. 

    Do the following:

    1. Select the text box labelled **Full name** and go to its properties.

    2. Set the **Editability** property to *Read-Only*.

    3. Delete the **First day** date picker as it is not relevant for this task. 

    4. Leave **WFH**, **Phone model**, and **Laptop model** fields:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/specify-details-form.png" alt="Specify Details Form" >}}

9. Only the Manager role can access the **SpecifyDevice_Workflow** page. Navigate to the page properties > **Allowed Roles** and deselect all roles except **Manager**.

10. When you created the page for the user task, a microflow called **DS_WorkflowUserTask_GetEmployee_OnboardingContext** was created automatically with it. This microflow is used to get data of user tasks and pass it, for example, to one of the pages. You need to set up security for this microflow.

10. Click the microflow icon in the left menu bar and open the **DS_WorkflowUserTask_GetEmployee_OnboardingContext** microflow.

10. Navigate to the microflow properties pane > **Allowed** roles and deselect all roles except Manager and Administrator.

10. Navigate back to the workflow and open the user task properties to finish the user task configuration. 

11. As only the manager should specify details for the new employee, you need to make sure that the user task is assigned to users with the Manager role only. Do the following:

     1. Make sure the **Assign Task Using** property is set to **Filter**. 

     2. Click the **Filter** property.

     3. In the **Assign task to** dialog box, the **Where** condition is set to **User Role** by default. Set the other part of the condition to **Manager** and click **Add**:

         {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/assign-task-to-manager.png" alt="Assign Task to Manager" >}}

Great job! You have created the user task for the Manager role:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/user-task-configured.png" alt="Configured User Task" >}}

## 8 Following Different Paths for the Hire's Location

Depending on whether the new hire is working from the office or home, there are two different processes to onboard this hire: prepare a desk in the office or send the laptop and phone to the home address. This step of the onboarding process should be done by the Facilities department.

Do the following:

1. Open the workflow editor > **Toolbox** and drag and drop the **Decision** activity after the **Manager: Specify Employee Details** user task. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/decision.png" alt="Adding a Decision" >}}
    
2. Decision means that the workflow path can split and follow one of the outcomes depending on the condition of the decision. For more information, see the [Decision](/studio/workflows-general-activities/#decision) section in *General Activities*. Open the decision properties and do the following:

    1. Set the **Caption** to **WFH?**.

    2. Click the **Condition** property.

    3. In the **Configure condition** dialog box, type in the expression that will split one flow into two depending on the **WFH** attribute: `$workflowData/WFH`.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/decision-properties.png" alt="Decision Properties" >}}

        Click **Save**.

3. Since the WFH attribute is Boolean, it has a true (when the new hire works from home) and a false (when they work from the office) outcome. These outcomes are added to the workflow automatically: 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/decision-outcomes.png" alt="Decision Outcomes" >}}

4. Now you need to configure what happens in both scenarios: when the new hire works from home (true) and when the new hire works from the office (false). Open the **Toolbox**, drag and drop a **User Task** activity to the **false** path, and do the following:

    1. Set its caption to **Facilities: Prepare Desk**.

    2. As only the Facilities department should prepare a desk for the new employee, you need to make sure that the user task is assigned to users with the Facilities role only. Refer to steps 11a-11c of the [Specifying Details of the New Hire](#specify-details) section to assign the user task to the Facilities role.

    3. Create a new page called **PrepareDesk** for the **Page** property referring to steps 7a-7d of the the [Specifying Details of the New Hire](#specify-details) section.

    4. You need to make sure that only the relevant information is displayed on the **PrepareDesk** page. By default, all attributes are added to the employee detail form. You need to make sure that the Facilities department will be able to view the fields but not change them. Do the following: 

    5. Select the data view with the employee details and go to its properties.

    6. Toggle the **Read-Only** property to make all fields in the form read-only.


        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/data-view-read-only.png" alt="Read-Only Data View" >}}
    
    7. Only the Facilities role can access the **PrepareDesk** page. Navigate to the page properties > **Allowed Roles** and deselect all roles except **Facilities**.

8. Now you need to create a user task for Facilities when the employee is working from home. Open the workflow editor.

6. Open the **Toolbox**, drag and drop a **User Task** activity to the **true** path, and do the following:

    1. Set its caption to **Facilities: Ship Devices**.

    2. As only the Facilities department should prepare a desk for the new employee, you need to make sure that the user task is assigned to users with the Facilities role only. Refer to steps 11a-11c of the [Specifying Details of the New Hire](#specify-details) section to do so.

    3. Create a new page called **ShipDevices** for the **Page** property referring to steps 7a-7d of the the [Specifying Details of the New Hire](#specify-details) section.

    5.  On the newly created **ShipDevices_Workflow** page all attributes are added to the employee detail form by default. You need to make sure that the Facilities department will be able to view the fields but not change them: select the data view with the employee details and go to its properties.

    5. Toggle the **Read-Only** property to make all fields in the form read-only:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/data-view-read-only.png" alt="Read-Only Data View" >}}

    7. Only the Facilities role can access the **ShipDevices_Workflow** page. Navigate to the page properties > **Allowed Roles** and deselect all roles except **Facilities**.


Great job! You have created the decision and user tasks on whether the new hire is working from the office or from home. Your workflow is configured!

## 9 Configuring Navigation

You need to configure navigation otherwise the user roles will not be able to reach any pages and interact with their tasks. Follow the steps below:

1. Open the [Navigation Document](/studio/navigation/), where some menu items are already preconfigured for you.

2. The HR roles needs to be able to access the **EmployeesToOnboard** page. Add a new menu item and do the following (for more information on how to add a new menu item, see [Navigation Document](/studio/navigation/)):

    1. Set its **On-Click Action** to **Page**.

    2. Click the **Page** property.

    3. In the **Select Page** dialog box, select the **EmployeesToOnboard** page.

    4. In the menu item properties, set **Caption** to **HR: Employees to onboard**.

    5. Set **Icon** to **User**.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/navigation-hr.png" alt="Navigation Item for HRs" >}}

3. You need to add menu items for manager to be able to open their task inbox. Add a new menu item and do the following (for more information on how to add a new menu item, see [Navigation Document](/studio/navigation/)):

    1. Set its **On-Click Action** to **Page**.

    2. Click the **Page** property.

    3. In the **Select Page** dialog box, switch from the current module to the Workflow Commons one using the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/select-page-for-navigation.png" alt="Select Page" >}}

    4. Find the **TaskInbox** page in the list and click **Select**.

    5. In the menu item properties, set **Caption** to **Task Inbox**.

    6. Set **Icon** to **Envelope**.

You have configured the navigation for your app and now you can preview and test it 

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/configured-navigation.png" alt="Configured Navigation" >}}

## 10 Testing the Workflow {#test-workflow}

Now you can test your workflow from the perspective of different users. 

For example, users who have tasks assigned to them (Manager, Facilities roles) will see their task inbox and dashboards pages where they can manage and monitor tasks assigned to them:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/task-inbox.png" alt="Task Inbox" >}}

The Workflow Admin role has access to the Workflow Admin Center and can monitor all workflows, can view the progress of workflows, and change the workflow settings.

The Admin role is able to manage users.

To test your workflow, you need to switch between different user roles. Follow the steps below:

1. Click  the **Preview** button. (For more information on how to preview your app, see [Previewing & Publishing Your App](/studio/publishing-app/).)

2. Click the user icon on the right and select a user role:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/user-roles.png" alt="Demo User Role" >}}

3. You can switch between different demo user roles to test the use case. Do can do the following:
    1. Select the demo_hr user role and start the onboarding process: add a new employee on the **EmployeesToOnboard** page, and then click **Start Onboarding**:
        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure/demo_hr.png" alt="Start Onboarding Button" >}}
    2. Switch to the Manager role, see a new task in the inbox, open the task, add data to it, and complete the task.
    3. Switch to the Facilities user role and complete the process.

4. Open the Workflow Admin Center.

5. Open the Workflow Dashboard.

Great job! You have previewed your app locally and tested your workflow from the perspective of different users. You can now work on adding more functionality to your app or share your app with other users to try it out in real life.
