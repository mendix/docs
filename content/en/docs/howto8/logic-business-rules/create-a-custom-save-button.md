## 1 Introduction

Mendix uses visual models called microflows to define the logic of your application. A microflow is a visual way of expressing what traditionally would be written in code. This how-to explains how you can create a custom save button on a detail page using a microflow. You will replace a default save button with the save button that shows a message to end-users after they click it. 

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Recreate the logic of the default **Save** button
* Create a custom **Save** button

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Create a basic data layer (for details, see [How to Create a Basic Data Layer](/howto8/data-models/create-a-basic-data-layer/))
* Create overview and detail pages for the customer object (for details, see [How to Create Your First Two Overview and Detail Pages](/howto8/front-end/create-your-first-two-overview-and-detail-pages/))
* Create a menu item to access the customer overview page (for details, see [How to Set Up the Navigation Structure](/howto8/general/setting-up-the-navigation-structure/))

## 3 Replacing the Default Save Button with a Custom One

To replace the default **Save** button with a custom one, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Customer_Detail** page:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/customer-detail.png" class="no-border" >}}

2. Select the **Save** button press <kbd>Delete</kbd> to remove it.

3. Right-click the drop-zone under the **Cancel** button, select **Add widget**, and then select **Call microflow button**.

4. In the **Select Microflow** dialog box, click **New** to create a new microflow. called **Customer_Save**.

5. After the button is created, open its **Properties** pane.

6. Change the **Caption** property to *Save*:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/button-properties.png" class="no-border" >}}

7. Set a floppy disk as the **Icon**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/18580987.png" class="no-border" >}}

You have created a button that calls a microflow.

## 4 Recreating the Default Save Behavior

You need to recreate the default Save behavior to customize it afterwards. Do the following:

1. Right-click the new **Microflow** button and select **Go to microflow** to open the new microflow. The microflow should look like the one below:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/created-microflow.png" class="no-border" >}}

2. Open the **Toolbox** and select the **Commit object(s)** activity there:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/8946802.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Drag a **Commit object(s)** action from the **Toolbox** to the flow between the start and end events.
4. Double-click the **Commit object(s)** activity to open its properties.

5. In the **Input** section, select **Customer** for **Object or List**, and click **OK**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/commit-object-properties.png" class="no-border" >}}

6. Open the **Toolbox**, find the **Close page** activity there, and drag it into the flow after the **Commit object(s)** activity:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/close-page-activity.png" class="no-border" >}}

You have recreated the default **Save** button logic.

## 5 Extending the Microflow with Your Own Functionality

To extend the logic with a custom message that will be shown when end-users click the button, do the following:

1. Open **Toolbox**, find the **Show message** activity, and drag it after the **Close page** activity.

2. Double-click the new activity to open its properties.

3. In the **Template** property enter a text that will be displayed in the message. Type in *Customer is saved!* 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/logic-business-rules/create-a-custom-save-button/show-message-properties.png" class="no-border" >}}

4. Click **OK** to save the changes. 

Congratulations! You have created a microflow and customized the **Save** button:
