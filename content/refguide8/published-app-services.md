## 1 Introduction

{{% alert type="info" %}}
App services are deprecated and were removed in Studio Pro 9. Use a [published web service](published-web-services) or a [published REST service](published-rest-services) instead.
{{% /alert %}}

An app service can be created via **File** > **New Document**.

Names of published app service documents must be unique (also with regard to published web service).
