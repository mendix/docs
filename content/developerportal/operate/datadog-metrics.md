## 1 Introduction

**Datadog** is a monitoring and analysis tool for cloud applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. You can link your Mendix Cloud v4 apps to Datadog to provide additional monitoring.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Datadog logging is supported in Mendix version 7.15 and above.
{{% /alert %}}

This document explains how to configure your Mendix Cloud v4 app to send data to Datadog.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
Datadog is not supported in Mendix Cloud v3, nor in default deployment buildpacks for other cloud platforms.

## 2 Datadog API Key{#api-key}

To make use of Datadog you will need a Datadog API key. If you already use Datadog, skip to the [Existing Datadog User](#existing-datadog-user) section to learn how to get one.

### 2.1 New Datadog User

If you are new to Datadog, you will need to get an account first.

1. Go to the Datadog site ([https://www.datadoghq.com/](https://www.datadoghq.com/)) and choose **GET STARTED FREE**.
2. Enter your Datadog account details. Once you have entered your details you cannot continue until you have set up your agent.
3.  Choose the option **From Source**.

    ![The From Source option on the Agent setup screen](attachments/datadog-metrics/from-source.png)

4.  Copy the value of *DD_API_KEY* key shown on the install script.

    ![Source install script shows DD_API_KEY=your API key](attachments/datadog-metrics/dd-api-key.png)

5. You now need to use this API key with your app: see [Connect Node to Datadog](#connect-node).

### 2.2 Existing Datadog User{#existing-datadog-user}

To find your existing API key, or to request a new one for your app, do the following:

1. Login to your Datadog account.
2.  Go to the **Integrations > API** screen.

    ![Datadog site: navigation to Integration, API](attachments/datadog-metrics/datadog-integrations-api.png)

3.  Copy an existing **API Key** or create a new one.

    ![Datadog site: API Keys page](attachments/datadog-metrics/datadog-api=keys.png)

4. For more information on Datadog API keys, see the following page on the Datadog site: [How do I reset my Application Keys](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/faq/how-do-i-reset-my-application-keys/) and related documentation.

## 3 Connect Node to Datadog{#connect-node}

To send your runtime information to Datadog, you need to provide the Datadog API key to your environment.

1. Go to the **Environments** page of your app in the *Developer Portal*.
2. Click **Details** to select the environment you wish to monitor with Datadog. 
3. Open the **Runtime** tab.
4. Add a **Custom Environment Variable**.
5.  Select **DD_API_KEY** from the *Name* dropdown.

	![Dropdown containing custom environment variable names](attachments/datadog-metrics/environment-variable-dd-api-key.png)

6. Enter the Datadog **API key**, obtained in the [Datadog API Key](#api-key) section, above, as the *Value* of the Environment Variable.
7. Add a second **Custom Environment Variable**:

	* **Name**: *DD_LOG_LEVEL*
	* **Value**: *INFO*

	This will ensure that some messages are sent to Datadog. You can change the log level later once you have confirmed that Datadog is receiving them.

7.  Return to the **Environments** page for your app and *Deploy* or *Transport* your app into the selected environment.

	{{% alert type="warning" %}}Your app must be **redeployed** as additional dependencies need to be included.<br/><br/>Restarting the app is not sufficient to start sending data to Datadog.{{% /alert %}}

8. **Restart** the application.

## 4 Customizing the Metrics Agent

By default, Mendix will pass a log of request handlers to Datadog.

The following Mendix *requests handler* calls will be passed to Datadog:

* `WebserviceRequestHandler`
* `ServiceRequestHandler` â€“ OData requests
* `RestRequestHandler`
* `ProcessorRequestHandler`
* `ClientRequestHandler`
* `FileRequestHandler`
* `PageUrlRequestHandler`

However, it is possible to add activities and microflows to be passed to DataDog, and to restrict which request handler calls are sent, by using JSON to configure the metrics agent. 

### 4.1 Format of Metrics Agent Configuration

You can specify which request handlers, microflows, and activities are reported to Datadog using a JSON configuration with the following format (note that this is the syntax and not an example of this custom setting):

```json
{
  "requestHandlers": [
    {
      "name": "*" | "<requesthandler>"
    }
  ],
  "microflows": [
    {
      "name": "*" | "<microflow>"
    }
  ],
  "activities": [
    {
      "name": "*" | "<activity>"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Value | What Is Sent | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"name": "*"` | All | Default |
| `"name": "<requesthandler>"` | All request handler calls of this type | see list of request handlers above |
| `"name": "<microflow>"` | Each time this microflow is run | The format is `<module>.<microflow>`<br />For example, `TrainingManagement.ACT_CancelScheduledCourse` |
| `"name": "<activity>"` | all activities of this type | click activities<sup><small>1</small></sup> below to see the list of options |

**<details><summary><sup><small>[1]</small></sup>Activities (click to see list)</summary>**

The following Mendix activities can be passed to Datadog:

* `CastObject`
* `ChangeObject`
* `CommitObject`
* `CreateObject`
* `DeleteObject`
* `RetrieveObject`
* `RollbackObject`
* `AggregateList`
* `ChangeList`
* `ListOperation`
* `JavaAction`
* `Microflow`
* `CallRestService`
* `CallWebService`
* `ImportWithMapping`
* `ExportWithMapping`
</details>

**Example**

The following example will send logs for:

* All request handlers
* The microflow `After_Startup` in the module `Administration`
* The `CreateObject` and `DeleteObject` activities

```json
{
  "requestHandlers": [
    {
      "name": "*"
    }
  ],
  "microflows": [
    {
      "name": "Administration.After_Startup"
    }
  ],
  "activities": [
    {
      "name": "CreateObject"
    },
    {
      "name": "DeleteObject"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.2 Passing a Configuration to the Metrics Agent

You pass the configuration to the metrics agent by adding a *Custom Runtime Setting* to your Mendix Cloud environment.

1. Go to the **Environments** page of your app.
2. Click **Details** next to the environment you have configured for Datadog.
3. Add a **Custom Environment Variable** *METRICS_AGENT_CONFIG* with the value of the JSON required for your configuration.

	![](attachments/datadog-metrics/datadog_metricsagentconfig.png)

4. Click **Save**.
5. Restart your app to apply the new settings.

## 5 Additional Information

### 5.1 Log Levels

The valid values for **DD_LOG_LEVEL** are:

* CRITICAL
* ERROR
* WARNING
* INFO
* DEBUG

### 5.2 Datadog Events Log

The Datadog Events log contains events which come from your app: those are the same events that would appear in the Mendix Console. It does not contain events from the environment.
