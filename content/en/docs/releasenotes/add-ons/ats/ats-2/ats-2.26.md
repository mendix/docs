## 2.26.0

**Release date: July 5th, 2022**

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue about the loss of dataset fields and parameter bindings that occurred when copy-pasting or duplicating custom actions.
* ATS now prevents editing while updating parameters to prevent possible data loss.
* ATS now shows a waiting pop-up window while fetching the fields of custom actions, which can be useful when there are lots of parameters in a custom action.

### Improvements 

* ATS now support [Data Grid 2](/appstore/modules/data-grid-2/).
