## 1 Introduction

The App Store is driven by contributions from members of the Mendix Community who share various components and apps they have built. This Community tool how-to presents all the necessary details on adding and updating App Store content.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Add new Desktop Modeler content and promotions to share in the App Store
* Update existing App Store content

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Familiarize yourself with the [App Store Overview](app-store-overview)

## 3 Adding New App Store Content<a name="AddingNewAppStoreContent"></a>

To add content to the App Store, follow these steps:

1. Click **Add content** in the top-right corner of the App Store home screen:

2. The **Share your content** page will open, where you need to select the purpose of your contribution:

    * **Share** — components that can be dowloaded using the Desktop Modeler
        * If you select this option, continue to [step #3](#3) below
    * **Promote** — a way to advertise a component or solution while not making it downloadable
        * If you select this option, continue to [step #4](#4) below
3. When adding Desktop Modeler content, select your **content source**:<a name="3"></a>
    * If you select **Select from GitHub**, follow these steps:

        a. Select the type of GitHub profile (**Organisation** or **User**) where the content is stored.

        b. Enter the **GitHub profile name**.

        c. Select the **GitHub repo** from which the content will be uploaded by clicking **Select**. The system will crawl all of the projects fpr that GitHub profile and present the Mendix package file (*.mpk*) options to you on the **Please select a repository** pop-up window. When you find the correct *.mpk* file name, click **Select** on this window.

        d. Select the **release** by clicking **Select**. If there are various releases of the *.mpk* file available, the system will present them to you on the **Please select a release** pop-up window. When you find the correct release, click **Select** on this window.

        e. Check the **Use GitHub readme.md** check box if you want the *readme.md* file to be included with the content.

        f. Note that the **Release notes** section is only available for updating a new version of the content (for more information, see [4 Updating Existing App Store Content](#UpdatingExistingAppStoreContent)).

4. In the **Publish to** drop-down menu, select the location where you want to publish your content:<a name="4"></a>

    * **Public App Store (visible for anyone)** – your content will be available to every developer in the Mendix community (this content will have to be reviewed and approved by Mendix before it is available)
    * **Private App Store (visible for your company)** – your content will be available only to the developers in your company (this content will not be reviewed by Mendix)
5. In the bottom half of the **Share your content** screen, do the following:

    * Enter a **Name** for your content
    * Select a category for your content from the **Category** drop-down menu
    * If you have published a demo using your content, enter the **Demo URL**

        ![](attachments/share-app-store-content/add_content_3.png)

6. On the **Overview** tab in the bottom half of the **Share your content** screen, you can do the following:

    * Enter an overview **Description** of your content (for example, "Node control is an native Android app that gives a system administrator access to the Mendix Cloud nodes being administered. From the app, the status of the different environments within a node can be monitored and an environment can be started or stopped.")
    * Upload **Screenshots** by clicking **Add screenshots** and selecting images of the content from your computer

7. On the **Documentation** tab, you can write or edit the documentation that should accompany your app in the editor. Note that this is only applicable when the **Use GitHub readme.md** check box is not checked, and you are only able to edit the documentation of your own and your company's content.
    * The documentation template includes the following sections that you must fill out in order to submit your content:
        * An extended **Description** of the content
        * The **Typical usage scenario** for the content
        * The **Features and limitations** for the content
    * These sections are optional:

        * The **Installation** steps and details
        * The **Configuration** steps and details
        * Any **Known bugs**
        * Any **Frequently Asked Questions**

        ![](attachments/share-app-store-content/add_content_5.png)

8. Note that there is nothing for you to do on the **Statistics** and **All versions** tabs. The **Statistics** tab will chart the downloads of your content over time. The **All versions** tab will list the various versions of your content that have been updated.
9. In the **Version Details** section on the bottom-right side of the screen, do the following:
    * Check the **Beta version** check-box if the content is in beta
    * Select the **Modeler version** on which you built the content
    * Select the type of **License** you want applied to your app (if applicable):

    * Click **Save draft** to save the draft of the content information, which will open the **Draft version** section at the top of the screen:

        ![](attachments/share-app-store-content/add_content_6.png)

        In this section, you can do the following:

        * In the **Status** section, if applicable, click the **error** link (for example, **(7 error(s))**) to bring up the **Warning** pop-up window that lists the information you need enter or fix before you submit the content
        * Click **Back** to go to the list of content drafts in the **My App Store** tab
        * Click **Edit** to continue editing the content information

    ![](attachments/share-app-store-content/update_content_1.png)

3. On the **Share your content** page, you can edit the content details (as described in [3 Adding New App Store Content](#AddingNewAppStoreContent)).
4. In the **Version Details** section, you must select the **Update type** so that the content is saved as a new version:

    * **Major update** – a large change (which will save the content from version 5.0 to version 6.0, for example)
    * **Minor update** – a medium-sized change (which will save the content from version 6.0 to version 6.1.0, for example)
    * **Patch** – a small change (which will save the content from 6.1.0 to 6.1.1, for example)

### 5.1 Widget Guidelines

To develop widgets and submit them to the App Store, follow these guidelines:

* The widget must be based on the [AppStoreBoilerplate](https://github.com/mendix/AppStoreWidgetBoilerplate)
* When writing variable and function names, use lowerCamelCase (for example, *mySecondVariable*)
* Add code comments
* Use descriptive variable and function names in both XML and JavaScript
* Always add `"use strict";` to functions
* A function may not be larger than 200 lines of code
* A function may only do one thing, and it should do it properly
* Internal variables should start with an underscore (`_`)
* The Dojo library and its functionalities are leading, but for external plugins you can use jQuery
* Create a test project based on the [AppStoreBoilerplate](https://github.com/mendix/AppStoreWidgetBoilerplate)
* Create test pages for mobile when content is mobile-supported

### 5.2 Module Guidelines

To develop modules and submit them to the App Store, follow these guidelines:

* Create a folder named **USE_ME** and add the microflows and pages that are relevant for the user
* Reduce the use of layouts – using snippets will result in fewer module dependencies and will reduce the number of potential errors (for example, missing layouts)
* User roles and security should be implemented 
* Creating a new release or module export should be done while the security level of the project containing the module is set to **Production**
* The module security status (in the **Project Security**) must be **complete** for the following:
    * Page access
    * Microflow access
    * OData access
    * Entity access
    * Dataset access
* For example pages and microflows to be copied to another module, they should be "excluded from project" in order to encourage duplication and reduce dependency errors 
* Do not rename entities and attributes when creating new versions, as data in these entities will get lost (replacing an existing module is based on the entity names)
* The module should include the English language
