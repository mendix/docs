## Label Properties

A label can be used to described the purpose of the widget to the user. The label is shown next to the widget in the user interface. If a label is configured, the widget will be rendered in the browser, wrapped in a form group. See [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms).

### Show Label

This property determines whether the label is rendered and the widget is wrapped in a form group.

Default value: Yes

### Label Caption

This property is shown only when Show Label is Yes. It determines what text is rendered within a label.

### Form Orientation

This property is shown only when Show Label is Yes. It determines whether the label is rendered on the same line as the input (Horizontal) or above it (Vertical).

Default value: Horizontal

### Label Width (Weight)

This property is shown only when Show Label is Yes. If the form orientation is set to horizontal this property can be used to specify the width of the label. The width is specified using column weights from the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) (see [Layout Grid](layout-grid)).
