## 1 Introduction

Expressions change a value based on a function or combination of functions. 

Named items (for example, objects, lists, or variables) can be called in an expression by inserting the name of the item and adding a dollar sign (for example,  `$customer` could refer to an object named `customer`).

Attributes and associations of objects are accessed using a slash (for example, the **Name** attribute of the customer object is referred to as `$customer/Name`, and the **CRM.Customer_Order** association of the customer object is referred to as `$customer/CRM.Customer_Order`).

Attributes of associated objects can be accessed using multiple slashes (for example, the **Number** attribute of a single associated **CRM.Order** is referred to as `$customer/CRM.Customer_Order/CRM.Order/Number`).

You can combine functions in an expression. In this case, you can use brackets to determine the priority and associativity of calculations. For example, the **SellingPrice** is being calculated based on the default **Price** and **Discount** attributes:

```sql
$CurrentPrice/Price - (($CurrentPrice/Price **div** 100) * $OrderLine/Discount)
```

Arithmetic functions (subtraction, dividing, and multiplying) are being combined here.

### 1.1 Examples

For example, you have an object called **package** with two attributes: `weight` (decimal) and `shippingCosts` (decimal). If the weight of a package is less than one kilogram, there are no shipping costs. Otherwise, the shipping costs are €5.00. The expression for changing the `shippingCosts` attribute is:

```sql
if $package/weight < 1.00 then 0.00 else 5.00`
```

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
When an object is empty, accessing an attribute is considered invalid. If part of an expression is invalid, it will cause an exception and the result will return `false`. The object's attribute cannot be accessed and the expression cannot be evaluated. This can be crucial when evaluating multiple statements within an expression. See the examples below for more information.
{{% /alert %}}

Evaluating the expression:

```sql
$emptyObject/attribute != $validObject/attribute or $emptyObject = empty
```

will always return `false`, as long as `emptyObject` is empty. The second part of the statement never gets evaluated.

To have both checks evaluated, the order of statements needs to be reversed:

```sql
$emptyObject = empty or $emptyObject/attribute != $validObject/attribute
```

This way the first statement gets evaluated.

### 1.2 Regular Expressions

[Regular Expression](/refguide/regular-expressions/) resource documents cannot be used in expressions. However, the format of regular expressions, sub-expressions, and quantifiers used in regular expression strings is the same as the ones described in the [Expression](/refguide/regular-expressions/#expression) section of *Regular Expressions*.
