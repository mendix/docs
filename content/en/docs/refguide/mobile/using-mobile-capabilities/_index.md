## 1 Introduction

Guides in this section will help you implement key features of native apps and/or progressive web apps (PWAs).

* [Offline-First Data](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/offlinefirst-data/): native and progressive web apps use an offline database and a synchronization mechanism to replicate data on the client for efficient access and offline capabilities
* [Deep Links](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/deep-links/): native apps can define a custom URL scheme (for instance, `my-app://`) that allows other apps to access pages and functionalities of the app
* [Internationalize Mobile Apps](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/): this guide allows your end-user to change the interface language on their mobile device within a Mendix mobile app
* [Location and Maps](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/location-and-maps/): native apps can access the user location and display native maps inside the application
* [Push Notifications](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/push-notifications/): native apps can present a notification to the user that is triggered by the runtime even if the app is not running
* [Local Notifications](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/location-and-maps/): in addition to push notifications, native apps can schedule notifications to be shown at a specific time even if the app is not running
* [Augmented Reality](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/augmented-reality/): native apps can render 3D objects in the physical environments via the camera stream of a mobile device
* [Content Security Policy](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/csp/): by employing a content security policy (CSP) in your app, you can protect it from malicious content which might try to take advantage of the app's trusted web page context
* [App Permissions](/refguide/mobile/using-mobile-capabilities/generic-permission-action/): this guide allows native apps to request permissions from iOS and Android device users
