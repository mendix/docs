The 'Show home page' action navigates to the home page for the current user. It goes to the same page as you go to after signing in and respects role-based home pages. This action has no properties to configure.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

See [Microflow Element Common Properties](microflow-element-common-properties) for properties that all activities share (e.g. caption).

{% endmarkdown %}</div>
