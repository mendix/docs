These are the release notes for the Hybrid App.

The version numbers for each release refer to the [Hybrid App Base](https://github.com/mendix/hybrid-app-base) and [Hybrid App Template](https://github.com/mendix/hybrid-app-template) packages, respectively.

If you're building the app using the regular PhoneGap Build approach from within the Mendix Developer Portal, you do not need to worry about these numbers. Downloading and building a new package will set you up with the latest version.

If you're using the advanced flow, you can get the latest version of the Hybrid App Base by running `npm update` from your hybrid app project directory. To upgrade to the latest version of the Hybrid App Template, either pull in the latest changes from GitHub, or download a new copy from the Mendix Cloud Portal ([Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/index.html) > **DEPLOY**).

## 2018

### January 31st, 2018 (1.7.4 / 1.4.0)

{{% alert type="info" %}}

For this update, we recommend that you download a fresh hybrid app package from the Mendix Cloud Portal ([Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/index.html) > **DEPLOY** > **Mobile App**).

* We fixed the issue where NPM updates failed consistently. This issue was related to the recently added local PhoneGap dependency. This local dependency is now removed. PhoneGap should be installed globally, and it should match the CLI version configured in the *config.xml* (for example, `npm install -g phonegap@7.1.0`). During NPM install/update, there will be feedback in the console regarding the current and required versions.
* We removed the *package-lock.json* files from both `mendix-hybrid-app-base` as well as `mendix-hybrid-app-template`. This makes it easier to stay up to date with the latest `mendix-hybrid-app-base` package.
* Example files for the *config.xml.mustache* and the *index.html.mustache* files are now created during NPM install/update.
* We removed the obsolete dependencies related to webpack.

### January 30th, 2018 (1.7.3 / 1.3.5)

* We removed the Cordova console plugin. This plugin was obsolete and caused issues while building iOS packages.

### January 23rd, 2018 (1.7.2 / 1.3.5)

* We updated the *package-lock.json* file to fix the issue where an old version of `mendix-hybrid-app-base` was being used.

### January 17th, 2018 (1.7.2 / 1.3.4)

* We added a cachebust to the `synchronizePackage` call so that a fresh copy of the static files is downloaded only when needed.
* We upgraded the Phonegap CLI version used to 7.1.0.
* We upgraded the **cordova-build-architecture** plugin to the latest version, which fixes the issue with setting up a local platform for the PhoneGap project.
* We added **npm** as a dev dependency to make local builds more robust.

## 2017

### December 22nd, 2017 (1.7.0 / 1.3.3)

* We renamed the command `prepare` to `prepare:all`, because it conflicted with the **npm** command of the same name.
* We updated the README with a table of contents and a list of known issues.

### December 2nd, 2017 (1.7.0 / 1.3.2)

* We updated some of the Cordova plugins to support the new iPhone X screen size/ratio/notch. Please follow the instructions in [iPhone X Support](https://github.com/mendix/hybrid-app-template/blob/master/IPHONEX.md) to configure your hybrid app to look good on an iPhone X.
* We improved how Android splash screens are configured. The old configuration could lead to memory-related crashes during startup.

### November 16th, 2017 (1.6.0 / 1.3.1)

*  Android icons and splash screens are now properly configured. For projects using the "do it yourself" workflow, apply the following change in *src/config.xml.mustache*:

  * Change:

    ```xml
    <{{{tag}}} src="{{{filename}}}" qualifier="{{{qualifier}}}"/>
    ```
    <br />
    to:<br />

    ```xml
    <{{{tag}}} src="{{{filename}}}" density="{{{qualifier}}}"/>
    ```

* We removed the superfluous error message in case of a failed PIN login.
* We fixed the issue where static files would synchronize on every startup, when **static resources from disk** was enabled in the Mendix project.
* In earlier versions, mobile apps with offline mode enabled would show a dialog box when a new version of the Mendix app was available. We changed this behavior to always update on startup. This prevents inconsistencies that can occur when the user decides to update the mobile app at a later moment.

### October 27th, 2017 (1.5.0 / 1.3.1)

* In some cases, it was possible to avoid the PIN login prompt. This release mitigates those cases. For hybrid apps that have PIN login enabled, upgrading to this release is highly recommended.

### October 17th, 2017 (1.4.3 / 1.3.1)

* Support for custom navigation profiles was removed. This affects Mendix apps running on version 7.2 or 7.3. For these apps, upgrading to a newer Mendix version is recommended.

### October 13th, 2017 (1.4.2 / 1.3.1)

* We added extra Phonegap commands (`plugin` and `prepare`).
* We added a `devDependency` to fix the failing build in some cases.
* We fixed the issue where some cleanup steps were skipped when the removal of cookies and/or PIN/login tokens failed.

### October 12th, 2017 (1.4.1 / 1.3.0)

* We fixed the wrong application of `Promise.all`, which broke the PIN flow.
* We fixed the `appbase` command, used internally to build the Phonegap Build *zip* file.

### October 11th, 2017 (1.4.0 / 1.3.0)

* This release improves support for the PIN login feature:
  * We updated the Phonegap CLI version to 7.0.1.
  * We improved support for switching users in combination with the PIN login feature.
  * We fixed an issue with the remaining session data.

### September 25th, 2017 (1.3.0 / 1.3.0)

* Based on feedback from the Mendix community, we decided to iterate on the command set that is at your disposal while building your Mendix hybrid mobile app. For instructions on how to use the updated commands, refer to the [Mendix PhoneGap Build App Template README](https://github.com/mendix/hybrid-app-template/blob/master/README.md).

### September 20th, 2017 (1.3.0 / 1.2.0)

* We added support for iOS 11 (ticket 56209). For existing hybrid apps, you can also update the `cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine-nextgen plugin` in the *config.xml* to version to 1.1.0 and publish again.
* We changed the keyboard type on the PIN login page to `tel`. (Ticket 54380)

### August 28th, 2017 (1.2.0 / 1.2.0)

* Whenever a new version of your Mendix application is deployed, the hybrid app will now ask the user to confirm that they are ready to update.

### August 25th, 2017 (1.1.2 / 1.1.1)

* We fixed the "malformed JSON" issue.

### June 13th, 2017 (1.0.4 / 1.0.3)
