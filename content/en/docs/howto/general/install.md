## 5 Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

Sometimes you can run into problems when installing Studio Pro. One work-around is to restart your system and install the prerequisites separately if they are not installed yet. 

The prerequisites are the following:

* [Microsoft .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) – we recommend using version 6.0.6 or above
* Java JDK

    * For Mendix Studio Pro version 9.18.0 and above – [Eclipse Temurin JDK 11 (x64)](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases)
    * For Mendix Studio Pro versions above 9.14.0 but below 9.18.0 – [Adoptium Temurin Java SDK](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.14.1%2B1/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.14.1_1.msi)
    * For Mendix Studio Pro versions below 9.14.0 – [AdoptOpenJDK 11](https://cdn.mendix.com/installer/AdoptOpenJDK/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.3_7.msi)
* [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 and 2019 Redistributable Package](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
* [Mendix Native Mobile Builder one-click Installer](https://appdev-mx-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/native-builders/latest.exe)
* [Git for Windows (x64)](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Evergreen Runtime (x64) (Evergreen Bootstrapper version)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)

Based on the error message you get from the installer you can decide to install a single prerequisite, or you can try to manually install them all.

After that you can retry installing Studio Pro.

## 6 Installing Mendix Studio Pro Offline {#offline}

The Mendix Studio Pro installation experience includes all the tools and frameworks required to run the application. If any of the prerequisites are not found at the moment of installation, the Studio Pro setup process will attempt to download and install the missing elements automatically. The Mendix Studio Pro installer does not include all dependencies and relies on internet connectivity to obtain them if any of the required pieces of software are missing. 

It is possible to prepare the prerequisite installers beforehand, so that the Mendix Studio Pro setup process can pick them up instead of downloading from the remote location. Follow these steps to prepare the installers:

1. Create a folder for the Mendix Studio Pro installer.
2. Download the latest [Mendix Studio Pro installer](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/) and move it into folder you created.
3. Create a folder with the name **Dependencies** in the same location where the Mendix Studio Pro installer was placed.
4. Download the prerequisites listed in the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section above and move them into the **Dependencies** folder.
5. Rename the following dependencies:
    * The Microsoft .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.x executable (*dotnet.exe*) to *windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0-win-x64.exe*
    * The Java Development Kit 11 (x64) *msi* (for example, *OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.3_7.msi*) to one of the following, depending on the Studio Pro version:
        * *adoptiumjdk_11_x64.msi* – for versions 9.14.0 and above
        * *adoptopenjdk_11_x64.msi* – for versions 9.13.x and below
    * The Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 (x64) executable (for example, *VC_redist.x64.exe*) to *vcredist2019_x64.exe*
    * The `latest` executable to *mendix_native_mobile_builder.exe*
    * The *Git-{version}-64-bit.exe* executable to *git_for_windows_installer.exe*
    * Do not rename the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Evergreen Runtime installer *MicrosoftEdgeWebview2Setup.exe*, keep it as is

6. Run the installer as described in the [Installing Mendix Studio Pro](#install) section above.

If the **AdoptOpenJDK 11 x64 failed; code 1639** error occurs during installation, try the following:

* Abort the installation process
* Install the Adopt Open JDK dependency manually from the dependencies folder using Administrator privileges
* Try to install Studio Pro again
