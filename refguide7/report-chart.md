A report chart is used to display a data set graphically as a set of vertical bars.

For each object in the data set one or more bars are displayed, depending on the defined Series of the report chart.

## Data Source Properties

### Data Set

The data set determines which data will be shown in the report chart.

## General Properties

### Aspect Ratio

This property determines the aspect ratio (width : height) of the report chart as the end user will see it.

### Generate Report on Page Load

If this property is false, the report chart will not show its data until the user clicks [Report](report-button). This is especially useful if the report uses parameters that should be specified by the user. 

## Chart Properties
