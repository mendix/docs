## 1 Introduction

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
It is not possible to target an Android API level higher than 30 with native mobile apps built with Mendix 8.18. If you need to support newer Android versions, please upgrade your app to [Studio Pro 9.24](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.24/). Note that this is required for apps published via the Google PlayStore.

For more information on migrating from Mendix 8 to 9, see [Moving from Mendix Studio Pro 8 to 9
](/refguide9/moving-from-8-to-9/).

As of Mendix 8, it is possible to build fully native mobile apps. Native mobile apps differ from hybrid apps in that they do not render inside a web view. Instead, they use native UI elements. This enables fast performance, smooth animations, swipe gestures, and improved access to all native device capabilities.
