## 7 Request Priority {#request-priority}

You can select the priority that you feel the request should have. Please note the SLA regulations for this priority (which can be checked online as well).

The priority is based on the combination of impact and urgency.

These are the possible impacts:

* **High** – a high priority production issue with a high impact on the customer’s business, impacting (almost) all users
* **Medium** – a production issue with intermediate impact on the customer’s business that impacts a group of users
* **Low** – a trivial production issue with no impact on the customer’s business

These are the possible urgency levels:

* **High** – the operational functionality is severely disrupted
* **Medium** – the operational functionality is limited disrupted
* **Low** – the operational functionality is hardly disrupted

You can set the priority to the following levels:

* **Critical**
* **High**
* **Medium**
* **Low**

The request priority is based on this matrix:
