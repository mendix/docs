## 1 Introduction

Grids show a list a objects and include a [data grid](data-grid) and a [template grid](template-grid). The main difference between these grids is the way the list of objects is displayed: a data grid shows it in columns, while a template grid shows it in tiles. 

Grids have the following components in common:

* [Search bar](search-bar) –  allows end-users to search for objects in the grid 
* [Sort bar](sort-bar) –  allows end-users to sort items in the grid 
* [Control bar](control-bar) –  allows end-users to control the objects displayed in the grid by means of buttons
