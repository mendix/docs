## Introduction

**Client Activities** perform activities in the client, for example, opening a page or showing a message. The activities described in this document are in the **Client Activities** section of the **Toolbox** and can differ for microflows and nanoflows.

The following are the client activities you can use in your microflow or nanoflow:

* [Nanoflow call](/refguide/nanoflow-call/) (nanoflows only) – calls another nanoflow
* [Close page](/refguide/close-page/) – closes the currently open page
* [Download file](/refguide/download-file/) (microflows only) – downloads a file using the browser
* [Show home page](/refguide/show-home-page/) (microflows only) – opens the home page for the end-user 
* [Show message](/refguide/show-message/) – shows a message to the end-user
* [Show page](/refguide/show-page/) – shows a selected page to the end-user 
* [Synchronize to device](/refguide/synchronize-to-device/) (microflows only) – enables selectively synchronizing a set of objects to the device when calling a microflow from a nanoflow
* [Synchronize](/refguide/synchronize/) (nanoflows only) – synchronizes data between your device and the server
* [Validation feedback](/refguide/validation-feedback/) – does a validation check, and if this check fails, it shows a message to the end-user
