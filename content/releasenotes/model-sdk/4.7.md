## 4.7.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MS-678 | None | Upgraded npm dependencies to latest versions. |
| MS-674 | Low | Added support for Modeler version 7.11.0. |
| MS-464 | Medium | For models created in Mendix 7.11.0 and above, all the properties that used to refer to entities and attributes using a `string` value have been replaced by properties that use the newly introduced types `domainmodels.EntityRef` and `domainmodels.AttributeRef`. An example is property `pages.MemberWidget.attributePath`, which has been replaced by the new property `attributeRef` from 7.11.0 onwards. |
