# How to deploy a Mendix app on Azure

Mendix is now available in the Microsoft Azure marketplace as an App that can run on a virtual server in the cloud.

**Congratulations, the Mendix instance is now running!**

## 2\. Creating a Deployment Package

Now that you've got your Mendix instance up and running, it's time to run an app on it. To do this you need to create a deployment package of your Mendix app and upload it to the Azure instance.

1.  Open the **Mendix Modeler**.
2.  **Log in** with your Mendix credentials.
3.  Open a **project** you want to run on the Mendix Azure instance.
4.  Create a deployment package of your project (**F7**).

13.  **Upload the deployment package** to the userâ€™s home folder on the server.

## 4\. Running the image for the first time

To be sure the image is fully up to date with the latest patches, follow the below steps.

1.  Open **PuTTY**.
2.  In the **Host Name** field type **the public IP of the instance**.
3.  Click **Open** and click **Yes** when you receive the security message.

    You now have SSH access to the Azure instance.
4.  Execute below commands:

    ```java
    sudo su

    echo "deb http://packages.mendix.com/platform/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mendix.list

    apt-get update
    apt-get dist-upgrade
    ```

5.  On the question to update waagent use default (N)

## 5\. Running the Mendix App on Azure

Now that the deployment package is in place you can deploy it on the instance. You'll use PuTTY to connect to the instance with SSH.

1.  Open **PuTTY**.
2.  In the **Host Name** field type **the public IP of the instance**.
3.  Click **Open** and click **Yes** when you receive the security message.

    You now have SSH access to the Azure instance.
4.  Before you start, switch to the MxAdmin user with the following command:

    ```java
    sudo su MxAdmin
    ```

    You are now MxAdmin on the instance.

5.  Copy the deployment package to the model-upload folder

    ```java
    cp [Deployment_Package] /srv/app/data/model-upload/
    ```

6.  In the console type **m2ee**. This will allow you to configure a Mendix app.
7.  Execute the following command:

    ```java
    m2ee(admin): unpack [Deployment_Package]
    ```

8.  Enter **y** to confirm that all content will be overwritten.
9.  If this is the first time you are unpacking a deployment package, Mendix may give a warning that it cannot find the Mendix Runtime. To solve this execute the following command:

    ```java
    m2ee(admin): download_runtime
    ```

10.  This will download the Mendix runtime.

11. Execute the following command:

    ```java
    m2ee(admin): start
    ```

12. You may receive a message that the database needs to be updated. Enter **e** to execute and save the changes.

    If successful, you will receive a message that the MXRuntime has started.

13. Finally, make the app accessible by configuring a password for the administrator with the following command:

    ```java
    m2ee(admin): create_admin_user
    ```

14. Enter a new password for the user. It needs to be at least 8 characters.

**The app can now be accessed through the browser.**

## 6\. Accessing the App

The Mendix instance on Azure is now fully configured and ready for use. Let's try and see if the app works!

1.  Open a browser and enter the **Public DNS/IP address** in the address bar.

    The browser will load the page over HTTP by default. The app is also accessible over HTTPS. Simply add https:// before the Public DNS. Alternatively, you can also use the Public IP.

2.  Login with **MxAdmin** and your admin **password**.

**Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Mendix app on Microsoft Azure.**
