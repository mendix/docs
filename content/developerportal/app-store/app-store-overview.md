## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/index3.html) is a vibrant marketplace containing complete sample apps that can be used right away as well as various add-ons (such as connectors, widgets, and modules) that can be used to build custom apps more quickly. In the App Store, you can browse all the content, get what you need, and share the content you have created.

This document describes all the different sections of the App Store.

The home page of the Mendix App Store presents various content categories:

**New content** | The most recently uploaded content. 
**Recent updates** | The most recently updated content.

* The number of times the item has been downloaded
