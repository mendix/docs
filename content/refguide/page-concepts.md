## Introduction

The documentation in this section describes the basic concepts that you need when working with pages in your app. It also helps you to create a flow which makes use of Mendix features

This section contains the following:

* [Conditions](conditions) –  describes how pages can be made dynamic by setting conditions, based on context, to decide whether a specific element is shown
* [Data Sources](data-sources) –  describes how data can be retrieved and used in data and list views
* [Opening Pages](opening-pages) –  describes how to open pages, how to ensure that the page displays the right information, and other things to bear in mind when designing your flow through the app
* [Starting Microflows](starting-microflows) –  describes all the different ways in which microflows can be triggered within a page
