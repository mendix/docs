## 1 Introduction

To ensure your applications run smoothly, they need to be actively monitored so that the information is available in order to do the following:

* Avoid performance problems
* Diagnose performance problems when they occur

New Relic is a flexible application performance management tool that provides information to help you achieve the above goals.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up application performance management for your Mendix application on New Relic

New Relic is not supported for apps deployed to the Mendix Cloud.

## 2 Prerequisite

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Create a New Relic account by signing up here: [https://newrelic.com/signup](https://newrelic.com/signup)

## 3 Setting Up

In this section, we will walk through all the steps to configure New Relic so that it can be used for the [application performance diagnostics](/addons/apd-addon/) of your Mendix application.

## 3.1 Setting Up New Relic (On-Premises Only)

The following steps are only relevant for on-premises deployments (if you are deploying your Mendix application to Cloud Foundry, skip to the [Cloud Foundry](#cloud-foundry) section below).

1. Sign in to New Relic and create a new application:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/manage-app-performance/manage-app-performance-with-new-relic/19398929.png" >}}
2. Select Java:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/manage-app-performance/manage-app-performance-with-new-relic/19398930.png" >}}

3. Download the Java agent archive and save your license key:

     {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/manage-app-performance/manage-app-performance-with-new-relic/19398932.png" >}}

4. Add your license key to the *newrelic.yml* file from the downloaded archive as described here: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/java-agent-manual-installation#h2-download-files](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/java-agent-manual-installation#h2-download-files).

## 3.2 Setting Up Your Mendix Deployment

### 3.2.1 Cloud Foundry {#cloud-foundry}

Follow these buildpack instructions to set up New Relic for Cloud Foundry deployments: [https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack#new-relic](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack#new-relic).

### 3.2.2 On-PremiseS Linux & Windows Service Console

To the `javaopts` list in your *m2ee.yaml* file, add "-javaagent:<path-to-javaagent>javaagent.jar". For example:

```java
 javaopts: [
   "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8", "-XX:MaxPermSize=128M", "-Xmx512M", "-Xms512M",
   "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/srv/mendix/data/tmp",
   "-javaagent:/opt/newrelic/javaagent.jar"
 ]
```

### 3.2.3 Mendix Studio Pro (Development Mode Only)

1. Open your Mendix application, and click **Settings** in the **App Explorer**.

2. Open a configuration:

     {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/manage-app-performance/manage-app-performance-with-appdynamics/19398903.png" >}}

3. In the **Extra JVM parameters** field on the **Server** tab, add: `-javaagent:<path-to-javaagent>javaagent.jar`:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/manage-app-performance/manage-app-performance-with-new-relic/19398904.png" >}}

## 4 Transactions

After completing the steps described above, all the requests handled by your Mendix application should become visible together with various graphs and statistics:

{{< figure src="/attachments/howto/monitoring-troubleshooting/manage-app-performance/manage-app-performance-with-new-relic/19398943.png" >}} 

## 5 Databases

Your database calls and queries will now be visible on the database page:
