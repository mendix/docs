The rollback-object action can be used to undo changes (that have not been committed) that were made to the object in the part of the microflow preceding the activity. Furthermore, it deletes objects that have been created but have never been committed.

**Rollback in sub microflows**

When the rollback-object action is performed in a sub microflow it will roll back the uncommitted changes in the sub microflow, as well as its parent microflow.

See [Microflow Element Common Properties](Microflow+Element+Common+Properties) for properties that all activities share (e.g. caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.
