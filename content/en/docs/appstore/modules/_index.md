## 1 Introduction

The modules available in the Mendix Marketplace can be added to your app to provide new functionality with accompanying domain models and security options. These Marketplace modules function similarly to the [modules](/refguide/modules/) you create for your app. 

When you download these modules, they will go into the **App** > **Marketplace modules** folder.
