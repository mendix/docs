The documentation in this section describes a new feature that is still in beta, and is subject to change before the final release.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

When the Hybrid Tablet profile is enabled, every user that accesses the Mendix application from a PhoneGap hybrid application running on a tablet device will automatically be redirected to this profile. If the Hybrid Tablet profile is disabled, tablet users will be redirected to the [Hybrid Phone Profile](hybrid-phone-profile). If the Hybrid Phone profile is disabled, users will be redirected to the [Desktop Profile](desktop-profile).
