## 1 Introduction

With report widgets, you can create reports from the database data. Reporting is mainly used for presenting aggregated information (for example , total sales per customer). 

The **Report widgets** category contains the following widgets:

* [Report grid](report-grid) – displays data in a form of a table; the data for the reporting widgets is provided by a [Data set](data-sets)

* [Report parameter](report-parameter) – allows the end-user to specify a parameter of a [Data set](data-sets) that is then used for filtering the data displayed in a report

* [Report date parameter](report-date-parameter) – allows the end-user to specify the DateTime parameter of a [data set](data-sets), which is then used for filtering the data displayed in a report
