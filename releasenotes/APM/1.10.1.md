This is a minor release.

## Mendix 7

This is the first version that is also available on Mendix 7. Due to some incompatibilities between 6 and 7 there are now 2 packages available in the AppStore. The standard package to download is the Mendix 7 package. Under older versions you can find the same version packaged for Mendix 6.

With the release of Mendix 7 the Mendix documentation changed and the help links in APM pointed to the wrong location. This has been fixed.

## Bug fixes
* In the creation of a trigger in a measurement with a query as the source. The created trigger was connected to the parameter, or so it seemed in the UI. This has been fixed to work as expected.

* A range validation in entity BaseTrigger that was on boolean TriggerContinuationPaused and should be on TriggerContinuationDelay is fixed.
