### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* We improved the performance of editing published web service operations. Operations that expose large data structures no longer cause Studio Pro to become irresponsive upon opening the editing dialog box. (Ticket 179950)

#### Other Improvements

* We improved the export size of the model. It should now be about half the size in a lot of cases. (Ticket 174121)
* We added a new way to convert between microflows and nanoflows by right-clicking the microflow or nanoflow in the **App Explorer**. For more information, see the alternative option specified in the [Converting a Microflow to a Nanoflow](/refguide/microflows/#convert-to-nanoflow) section in *Microflows* and in the [Converting a Nanoflow to a Microflow](/refguide/nanoflows/#convert-to-microflow) section in *Nanoflows*.
* We added support for signing in using a macOS external browser. This requires configuration. For details, see the [Configuring Your Windows Virtual Machine for Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac/#configuring) section in *Configuring Parallels*.
* We updated the login image shown on startup.
* We included dark-mode support for the login dialog box shown on startup.
* We updated the colors of the microflow editor.
* We updated the style for controls residing in a toolbar.
* We updated the style for button controls.
* We updated the style for the breadcrumb, loading bar, scrollbar, and tooltip UI components.
* We improved the naming generation in the JSON structure.
* We added a button to the toolbar of the workflow editor enabling the export of a workflow to an image.
* We added a button to filter MxAssist Performance Bot best practices to documents that are not yet committed to version control.
* We added default values for the `ProcessedTasksCleanupAge` and `ScheduledEventsCleanupAge` Mendix Runtime settings. The default value is now 365 days for existing apps with data and 7 days for new apps or apps with an empty database. Previously, the default values were empty and required an explicit Mendix Runtime setting configuration in order to perform cleanup.
* We updated the MxAssist Logic Bot for when a Boolean decision is chosen (at the top level or in a loop) and both the true and false flows are created.
* We added <kbd>{F1}</kbd> help support to the MLKit document and fixed an issue with its **Properties** pane.
* We updated the MxAssist Performance Bot Best practice [MXP011](/refguide/performance-best-practices/#mxp011) to group recommendations together. There is one group for each stack of deeply nested views.
* We added highlighting for when you hover over tree control rows.
* Previously, a single XPath query could result in multiple SQL queries to the database, and if an XPath query was run outside of a transaction (meaning, not in a microflow, but in a data grid, for example), these SQL queries were executed concurrently. This is no longer the case. This simplifies debugging, logging, and tracing.
* For pluggable widgets with a system property Label, **Show label** is now set to **Yes** by default.

### Fixes

* We fixed [CVE-2023-29017](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29017).
* The `weekday-from-dateTime` XPath function  and the  `DATEPART(WEEKDAY, ...)` OQL function now return the documented values of (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday) for all supported databases. (Ticket 130641)
* We fixed an issue where it was possible to add a path after a non-object variable, which led to issues in the running app. (Tickets 171893, 172495)
* We adjusted consumed OData services to use query options in the request body when the given service is configured to do so and pagination with `@nextLink` takes place. (Ticket 176976)
* When a database transaction for a microflow does not perform any database operation for 10 minutes, it is automatically aborted. When the same microflow then does another database operation, this previously silently started a new database transaction, losing the earlier updates. Now, the microflow results in an error. (Ticket 174408)
* We fixed an issue in the domain model editor where an element outside the boundaries of the current view was not scrolled to when there was navigation via [Go to options](/refguide/go-to-option/). (Ticket 178829)
* We fixed an issue where a domain-level validation message could not be translated. You can now use the `mendix.lib.Validations.field_issue` system text to translate and change this message. (Tickets 180448, 181175)
* The results of [Find Usages](/refguide/find-and-find-advanced/#find-usages) now include enumeration values used for conditional visibility. (Ticket 180727)
* We fixed an issue where an application with excluded *.jar* files failed to deploy. (Ticket 181931)
* We fixed an issue where creating a non-persistable entity led to errors when attributes were read-only.
* We fixed an issue where exporting recommendations from MxAssist Performance Bot was including suppressed recommendations.
* We fixed the issue where for PostgreSQL and Oracle databases, the `DATEDIFF` function in OQL calculated the difference in calendar weeks, which was inconsistent with other databases that calculate the difference in full weeks.
* We fixed a Mendix Runtime error that occurred when a microflow was no longer being used in an app after doing a hot reload in Studio Pro.
* We fixed the issue where the `DATEDIFF` OQL function in Oracle threw an exception when calculating a difference in seconds.
* We fixed an issue where the status of `ScheduledEventInformation` was `Completed` when the associated scheduled event failed.
* We fixed an issue in published web services where editing an operation that had a parameter and/or a return type had been removed caused an error.
* The return type of the `round()` function with the second parameter now always returns a Decimal, even if the precision is 0.
* The `ceil()`, `floor()`, and `round()` functions with a single argument now throw an exception if the result cannot be represented as an Integer/Long (for example, due to overflow).
* We fixed an issue where the outcome selector dialog box for a completed workflow user task activity showed duplicate outcomes.

### Deprecations

* We increased the default BCrypt cost factor from 10 to 12. A BCrypt cost factor below 12 is deprecated and will be forbidden in a future release. Use a BCrypt cost factor of at least 12.
* We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.core.UseMimeDecoderForBase64` Mendix Runtime setting. Base64 decoding is now always strict, as specified by RFC 4648.
* We removed the deprecated `rollbackTransAction()` method from the public `IContext` interface. Use `rollbackTransaction` instead.

### Breaking Changes

* The `parseDateTime\[UTC\]` microflow functions now use [strict parsing](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/DateFormat.html#setLenient(boolean)) by default. To revert to lenient parsing, set the `com.mendix.core.LenientDateTimeParsing` custom Mendix Runtime setting to `true`. (Ticket 169612)
* Legacy scheduled events (meaning, those that are non-repeating or have a start time) are no longer supported.
* We are more strict in the URL formats we accept at the Mendix Runtime server. We no longer allow empty path segments (meaning, `//`, as in `http://your.app//`), ambiguous path segments (`http://your.app/%2e%2e/path`), or UTF-16 encoding (`http://your.app/path%u2192`).
* It is no longer possible to call `clear()` on the list returned by the `IDataTable.getRows()` API function. The list returned by `subList()` is no longer modifiable.
* Instances of `IDataTable`, `IDataTableSchema`, and `IDataColumnSchame` no longer provide equality. As of now, `equals()` and `hashCode()` are based on object identity.
* In Mendix [9.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.0/), we removed support for Mendix Runtime uniqueness validation in preference of database uniqueness validation. There was still a custom setting to use the old behavior. This setting has now been removed.
* An XPath constraint of the form `[$objectVariable/BooleanAttribute]` (where the microflow variable is not set) used to be ignored. Now, it is treated as `[false()]`.
* Duplicate column names in an OQL query are no longer allowed.
* In OQL, using a path with an association in the `ON` clause of an `OUTER JOIN` is no longer allowed.
* In OQL, comparing an attribute to a collection parameter can only be done with the `IN` or `=` operators (as in, `Attribute IN $param`).
* In OQL, clauses like `Attribute = $RangeParameter`, `Attribute > RANGEBEGIN($RangeParameter)`, and `Attribute < RANGEEND($RangeParameter)` with an infinite range (from `null` to `null`) used to be ignored. Now, they are treated as `true`. This makes a difference when the clause has `OR` with another clause.  Similarly, `Attribute < RANGEBEGIN($RangeParameter)` with a range starting with `null` or `Attribute > RANGEEND($RangeParameter)`  with a range ending with `null` are no longer ignored, but treated as `false`.
* We changed the MIME type returned for *.js* files from the legacy `application/javascript` to `text/javascript`.
* We removed the deprecated error constants from `AdminException` and `IMxRuntime`.
* We removed the deprecated `IActionRegistrator#bundleComponentLoaded` method.
