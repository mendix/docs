## 1 Introduction

When you upgrade to Mendix 8, your widgets' DOM structure will be changed. This means that the correlating Sass styling will not work as expected anymore. This document will allow you to make your theming compatible with Mendix 8.

Each section in this document could apply to your app project, but some sections may *not* apply. If a section does not apply to your case, you may skip it.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}If you have added any content in the **Atlas_UI_Resource module**, you have to move that content out of the module. If you do not, it will be overwritten.{{% /alert %}}

Follow the steps below to begin upgrading your Atlas UI Resources module:

1. Download the latest [Atlas UI Resources](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/104730/) module (v2.0.0 or higher).
2. Import this module into your app and replace the old resource module. This will overwrite the layouts, page templates, and building blocks inside of the resource module. The **theme** folder related to your old resource module will be moved to **theme_old**. You will get a new **theme** folder with the latest changes. From here, you must choose one of the following based on if you have custom styling or not:<br />
	* If you did not change anything in the old **theme** folder, you can safely remove **theme_old** and leave everything else as is. Your styling will work and you can stop with consulting this document. <br />
	* If you did change anything in the old **theme** folder, you will have to do some manual work to align your styling. Consult the information below to decide what to do based on your needs.

## 2 Integrating the Old Theme Folder into the New One

When migrating from Mendix 7 to Mendix 8, you must integrate **theme_old** into **theme** while adhering to several guidelines. Which guidelines you must follow vary based on your specific project. Consult the subsections below for instructions based on your unique case.

## 2.1 Working with HTML Files

If you have altered your HTML files, consult the instructions below. If you have not, you may ignore this subsection.

If you changed any **index\*.html** files, make sure to do the following:

* Apply the same changes you did in the old file to the new HTML file
* Make sure the **bootstrap.min.css**, **bootstrap-rtl.min.css** and **mxui.css** imports are not there
* Make sure you don’t import **styles/css/lib/lib.css** anymore
* Make sure you’ve put either `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/web/css/main.css?{{cachebust}}">` or `{{themecss}}` inside of the `<head></head>` tags

If you changed any **login\*.html** files, complete the following actions:

* Apply the same changes you did in the old file to the new HTML file
* Confirm the **bootstrap.min.css** and **mxui.css** imports are gone (if they are not, delete them)
* Make sure you don’t import `styles/css/lib/lib.css` anymore [todo: discuss this to edit it]
* Place either `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/web/css/main.css?{{cachebust}}">` or `{{themecss}}` inside of the `<head></head>` tags

## 2.2 Working with JSON Files

If you have altered your JSON files, consult the instructions below. If you have not, you may ignore this subsection.

If you changed Design Properties for Web in **settings.json**, you must manually integrate your old **settings.json** into the new folder.

If you changed Hybrid App imports in **components.json**, make sure to do the following:

* Manually integrate your old **components.json** into the new folder
* Confirm the **bootstrap.min.css**, **bootstrap-rtl.min.css** and **mxui.css** imports are gone (if they are not, delete them)
* Confirm that **styles/css/lib/lib.css** is changed to **styles/web/css/main.css**

### 2.3 Working with Custom Folder Files

If you have altered your custom folders, consult the instructions below. If you have not, you may ignore this subsection.

If you added, removed, or changed custom variables in a custom folder, copy your content from **theme_old/styles/sass/custom/_custom-variables.scss** to **theme/styles/web/sass/app/_custom-variables.scss**.

If you added or changed custom styling in the custom folder, copy your content or files from **theme_old/styles/sass/custom/** to **theme/styles/web/sass/app/**.
* In this case, also make sure that your old **custom.scss** file is renamed to **_custom.scss**

### 2.4 Working with Lib Folder Files

If you have altered your **styles/sass/lib** folder, consult the instructions below. If you have not, you may ignore this subsection.

If you changed any files in the **styles/sass/lib** folder, complete the actions below::

* If you changed a file’s content or name, you must manually make the same changes in the related file in the new theme folder (while also keeping the Mendix 8 [DOM changes](migration-dom-issues) in mind)
* If you removed a file, no action is required

If you added a file to the **lib/base** folder, copy that file from **theme_old/styles/sass/lib/base/** to **theme/styles/web/sass/core/base/**. You must also complete the following action:

* Import the file in `theme/styles/web/sass/main.scss` in the `core/base` group on alphabetic order

If you added a file to the `lib/components` folder, copy that file from **theme_old/styles/sass/lib/components/** to **theme/styles/web/sass/core/widgets/**. You must also complete the following action:

* Import the file in **theme/styles/web/sass/main.scss** in the **core/widgets** group in alphabetic order

If you added a file to the **lib/customwidgets** folder, copy that file from **theme_old/styles/sass/lib/customwidgets/** to **theme/styles/web/sass/core/widgetscustom/**. You must also complete the following action:

* Import the file in **theme/styles/web/sass/main.scss** in the **core/widgetscustom** group in alphabetic order

If you added a file to the **lib/buildingblocks** folder, copy that file from **theme_old/styles/sass/lib/buildingblocks/** to **theme/styles/web/sass/resources/atlas_resources_default/buildingblocks**. You must also complete the following action:

* Import the file in **theme/styles/web/sass/main.scss** in the **resources/atlas_resources_default/buildingblocks** group in alphabetic order

If you added a file to the **lib/layouts** folder, copy that file from **theme_old/styles/sass/lib/layouts/** to **theme/styles/web/sass/resources/atlas_resources_default/layouts**. You must also complete the following action:

* Import the file in **theme/styles/web/sass/main.scss** in the **resources/atlas_resources_default/layouts** group in alphabetic order

Make sure any custom or added SASS files are all imported in either **styles/web/sass/main.scss** or **styles/web/sass/app/_custom.scss**.

After troubleshooting your issues with the guidance above, complete the following steps to test your migrated app project:

1. Recompile your SASS to CSS.
2. Test your app project to see if everything works as expected.
3. Delete **theme_old**.
