## 1 Introduction

The [Portfolio Management](https://portfolio.mendix.com) tool is available to all Mendix customers. It enables staying informed about initiatives and managing them in the different development stages. It provides portfolio managers, business stakeholders, and developers with everything they need to collaborate effectively in one place and bring new initiatives to the Mendix Platform. To start the Portfolio Management app, go to the Developer Portal, open the [Switch to menu](/developerportal/), and select **Portfolio**.

## 2 Portfolio Landscape Overview {#portfolio-landscape}

When you start the Portfolio Management app for the first time, an introduction page opens. The introduction page describes the new features and gives helpful information. You can click **Get Started** to open the **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page. After that, when you start the Portfolio Management app, the **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page directly opens. You can click **Learn more about Portfolio Management** to go back to the introduction page.

### 2.1 My Portfolios vs Company Portfolios

The **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page contains two sections: **My Portfolios** and **Company Portfolios**. A section only appears if there is at least one [portfolio card](#portfolio-card) in that section.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/portfolio-landscape-overview.png" >}}

**My Portfolios** shows all the portfolios to which you have access. Clicking a portfolio card opens the portfolio.

**Company Portfolios** shows all the restricted portfolios in your company, to which you do not have access. Clicking a portfolio card shows more details about the portfolio. You can request access to a restricted portfolio by clicking **Request to Join** on the portfolio card. A Portfolio Manager needs to approve this [access request](#access-requests).

### 2.2 Portfolio Cards {#portfolio-card}

On the **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page, each portfolio is presented in a card. On a portfolio card, you can see the name of the portfolio, the company to which it belongs, the [privacy settings](#privacy-settings), and the avatars of Portfolio Managers (up to avatars of four Portfolio Managers).

#### 2.2.1 Different Privacy Settings of a Portfolio {#privacy-settings}

Currently, the privacy settings of a portfolio can be private or restricted. Their differences are shown in the table below:

| Portfolio type | Visible in the **Company Portfolios** section?               | How to join the portfolio?                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Private        | {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/cross-mark.svg" >}} | A Portfolio Manager can [add users to the portfolio](#add-users). |
| Restricted     | {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/check-mark.svg" >}} | A Portfolio Manager can [add users to the portfolio](#add-users). Users can also request access by clicking **Request to Join** on the portfolio card. A Portfolio Manager needs to approve this [access request](#access-requests). |

A Portfolio Manager can change the **Privacy Settings** on the [Portfolio Settings](#portfolio-settings) page.

### 2.3 Opening a Portfolio 

When you click a portfolio card to which you have access, the portfolio opens with a menu on the left side. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/opened-portfolio.png" >}}

Clicking a menu item opens the corresponding page:

* [Initiatives Overview](#initiatives-overview)
* [Archive](#archived-initiatives)
* [Access Management](#access-management)
* [Portfolio Settings](#portfolio-settings) (only available for Portfolio Managers)

### 2.4 Creating a New Portfolio {#create-portfolio}

On the **Portfolio Landscape Overview** page, you can create a new portfolio as follows:

1. On the upper-right corner of the page, click **Create Portfolio**. The **New Portfolio** dialog box opens.

2. Enter **Portfolio Name** and **Description** for the new portfolio.

3. For **Privacy Settings**, select **Private** or **Restricted**. For details on privacy settings, see the [Different Privacy Settings of a Portfolio](#privacy-settings) section.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}If the toggle on the [Privacy Requests](/control-center/portfolios/#privacy-requests) tab is turned on in Control Center, a Mendix Admin needs to approve the creation of a restricted portfolio. In that case, a Mendix Admin will receive a notification about your request and can approve or reject your request from the [Control Center](/control-center/portfolios/#privacy-requests). The **Privacy Settings** of the portfolio will be **Private** until a Mendix Admin approves your request.{{% /alert %}}

4. For **Prioritization Model**, select [WSJF Prioritization](/developerportal/portfolio-management/#wsjf) or [RICE Prioritization](/developerportal/portfolio-management/#rice).

5. From the **Currency** drop-down list, select the default currency for this portfolio.

6. Click **Create**.

The portfolio is created. You are the first Portfolio Manager of this portfolio. You can start [inviting other people](#add-users) to the portfolio.

## 3 Initiatives Overview {#initiatives-overview}

In the Portfolio Management app, the term "Initiative" represents a business objective or strategic goal, and could span across multiple apps. An initiative can be related to multiple apps or just one small part of a big app. For progress tracking, Mendix recommends breaking down an app into smaller initiatives whenever possible.

The **Initiatives Overview** page gives an overview of all the initiatives in this portfolio.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/initiatives-overview.png" >}}

In the search box on the top, you can search for an initiative by the initiative name.

On the upper-right corner, you can use the drop-down list to [change the view](#change-view). Clicking **Filters** enables you to filter initiatives and the results persist even after you change to a new view. You can [export and import Initiatives](/developerportal/portfolio-management/export-import-initiatives/) by clicking the {{% icon name="office-sheet" %}} icon, and [create a new initiative](#create-new-initiative) by clicking the **Create Initiative** button.

{{% /alert %}} 

You can link any epic from [Epics](/developerportal/project-management/epics/) to an initiative. Follow the procedure below:

1. Make sure the app to which the epics belong is already linked in the **Link Existing App** field. 

   If the epics that you want to link belong to multiple apps, make sure these apps are all linked in the **Link Existing App** field.

   {{% alert color="info" %}}For more information about the differences among initiatives, apps, and epics, read the [section](#differences-initiatives-apps-epics) below. {{% /alert %}}

##### 3.1.3.1 Differences Among Initiatives, Apps, and Epics {#differences-initiatives-apps-epics}

An initiative is usually worked upon in several epics.

To learn more about the differences among initiatives, epics, and user stories, check out our [learning path](https://academy.mendix.com/link/modules/599/lectures/4660/2.2-The-Role-of-Portfolio-Management-in-the-Application-Lifecycle) and the examples below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/portfolio-management/initiative-epic-user-story.png" >}}

The following figure shows examples of three portfolios. The first portfolio is to add a feature to an app, the second example is a minimal viable product (MVP) of an app, and the last example is to build an integration between two apps.
