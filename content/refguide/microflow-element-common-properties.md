## 1 Introduction

This document describes common properties that are shared by many elements in the microflow editor.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}

Not every element in a microflow or a nanoflow has all of these properties.

{{% /alert %}}

Common properties for microflows and nanoflows are the following ones:

* [Caption](#caption)
* [Auto-generate caption](#auto-generate-caption)
* [Background color](#color)

## 2 Caption {#caption}

The caption describes to a user what happens in this element. 

## 3 Auto-Generate Caption{#auto-generate-caption}

The auto-generate caption property specifies whether the caption is automatically generated based on the type of activity.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | The caption of the activity is generated by Studio Pro. |
| No | You can edit the caption yourself in the **Caption** property. |

_Default value_: Yes

## 3 Background Color {#color}

Here you can choose a background color for the activity. Colors do not influence execution; they are only used to quickly spot an element in a flow. For example, you can make activities with [error handlers](microflows#errorhandlers) red so you can easily identify them.
