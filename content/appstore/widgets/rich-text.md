## 1 Introduction

The [Rich Text](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/74889/) widget enables rich inline and toolbar text editing.

### 1.1 Features

* Format selected text
* HTML output of formatted text
* Show editor options either on a toolbar or as a bubble
* Use the custom option to select which editing options you want to show
* Input and display text is sanitized

### 1.2 Demo App Project

For a demo app project that has been deployed with this widget, see [here](http://texteditorwidget.mxapps.io).

## 2 Configuration

Place the widget in a data view, list view, or template grid with a data source that has a string attribute. Then, select the **Value attribute** that contains the editable text.

The input and output is sanitized. All unsupported HTML tags and JavaScript is removed for security reasons. The following are supported:

* Tags: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `br`, `a`, `ul`, `li`, `ol`, `s`, `u`, `em`, `pre`, `strong`, `blockquote`, `span`
* Attributes:
	* For all tags: `class`, `style`
	* `a` tag: `href`, `name`, `target`
* Schemes: `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `mailto`

{{% alert type="info" %}}
To be fully secure, all user HTML input should be sanitized on the server side too. This could be done with the XSSSanitize action found in the [Community Commons](/appstore/modules/community-commons-function-library). When the option 'Sanitize content' is set to 'false' server side sanitating is required before showing any HTML content.
{{% /alert %}}

## 3 Usage

The following keyboard shortcuts can be used when editing:

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> – bold
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>– italicize
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> – underline
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> – undo
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> – redo
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> – copy
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> – paste
* <kbd>-</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> – start list
* <kbd>tab</kbd> – indent the content when <kbd>tab</kbd> is configured to indent from the widget XML; otherwise, move the focus to the next element

## 4 Developing This App Store Component
