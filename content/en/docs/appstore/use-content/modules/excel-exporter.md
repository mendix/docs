## 1 Introduction

With the [Excel Exporter](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/726/) module, you can create templates that export data from your Mendix application to the Excel, macro-enabled Excel, or CSV formats. The module creates an OQL query and directly prints the result to a FileDocument system module entity in your desired format. You can add styling to your Excel to create proper headers and styling formats in order to create a complete report.

The Excel Exporter is compatible with the [Excel Importer](/appstore/modules/excel-importer/) version 8.1.1 or higher and [Atlas UI Resources](/appstore/modules/atlas-ui-resources/) version 1.2.2 or higher.
