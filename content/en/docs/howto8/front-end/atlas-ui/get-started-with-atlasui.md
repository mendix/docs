## 1 Introduction

Mendix Studio is a powerful collaborative tool that lets you build your application in the cloud together with your team. When you sign into Mendix Studio for the first time, you get the option to choose an app template that is powered by Atlas UI.

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Choose an app template
* Edit your app in Mendix Studio
* Choose a page template
* Customize your theme

## 2 Prerequisite

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

## 3 Choosing Your App Template

In the [Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/index.html), click **Create App**.You will see a number of apps marked with **ATLAS UI**, which are Atlas UI-based app templates. You can select one to get started.

Note that when you click **Edit App** for any Atlas UI app, it will automatically open in Mendix Studio. If you need to edit the app in Studio Pro, click the drop-down menu on the **Edit App** button and select **Edit in Studio Pro**.

## 5 Exploring Mendix Studio

Your app is ready to be built. In the **Toolbox** in the page editor, you will find building blocks and widgets you can build your pages with.

All these resources have been created with Atlas UI. Each building block has an information icon that directs you to the Atlas UI website for the relevant information:
