## What You Can Expect from Mendix Support

Although our platform is highly accessible and new versions of our products are tested extensively before going live, we want to provide the assurance that we are available in the case of disruptions.

Mendix Support is here to answer any questions and solve any issues that you might have. We try to make your journey as frictionless as possible.

### Service Level Agreements

We are availalbe for all users of the Mendix Platform, and we are bound by service-level agreements (SLA) to our licensed customers. Licensed customers can select their type of SLA level: **Platform** or **Platinum**. The SLA level determines the specific agreement on the following points:

* Support availability
* Platform availability
* Maintenance
* Incident response time
* Incident resolution time
* Recovery time objective (RTO)
* Recovery point objective (RPO)

The SLA for your company is available upon request. Please contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com) or your Customer Success Manager if you want to check the details.

## Finding Your Answers

We expect that many questions and issues can be solved by reading the Mendix [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com) and by exploring the [forum](https://forum.mendix.com). If you canâ€™t find the answer to your question in one of these locations, you can submit a question, incident, or change request with Mendix Support. We will act as the focal point for issues on the Mendix Modelers, your applications, and the [Developer Portal](https://home.mendix.com). We will forward the issue to the second and third line if necessary.

## Feature Requests

We would like to invite you to an important channel where you can provide feature requests to Mendix: the [Mendix Idea Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/link/ideas/). Every quarter, any customer can post a feature request that can be reviewed, expanded on, and voted on by other members of the Mendix Community. Based on this feedback, we will determine which features have the most value according to our customers, and we will implement them.

For more details about the idea forum, see [The Mendix Forum](/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-forum#IdeasTab).

## Accessing Mendix Support

You can access the Mendix Support team through the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com), via email (support@mendix.com), or by phone (phone numbers are listed in the Support Portal). Please note that critical tickets always need to be accompanied by a phone call to speed up the triage of the issue. In the Support Portal, you can check the status of your personal tickets, check all the submitted tickets on your applications, and provide updates on them.

## What We Expect from You

Mendix supports the Mendix Platform, and we expect you to support the applications that you have built on the platform. The following points are not supported through the standard SLA:

* Developing code on your behalf
* Debugging or troubleshooting your applications
* Analyzing and troubleshooting the performance of your applications or your infrastructure, except when we suspect an underlying issue exists in the Mendix Platform
* Troubleshooting Mendix Community-developed components from the Mendix App Store

During the start phase and through part of the scale phase of your digital transformation journey, it might be best to let the development team (DevOps) handle the support of the applications. As the number of applications grows, it is best to let an expert service desk handle the support of your applications. You can involve your existing service desk team or outsource support to one of our support partners, which you can find listed on the [Mendix Partners](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/openid/login?immediate=true&continuation=link/partneroverview) page.

### Company Admins

To manage your company account and the users, projects, and licensed cloud nodes of your company, you can appoint company admins in the [Platform Portal](https://home.mendix.com).

### Technical Contacts

You need to appoint a technical contact for each of your applications. The technical contact checks the performance of the applications in the Developer Portal and receives alerts from the Mendix Developer Portal based on errors and warnings in each application. It is possible to make other team members receive these alerts as well.

It is very important to read these alerts carefully and to act upon them, as they can influence the performance of your app. For more information on alerts, see [Alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health).

### Training

We expect your support team to be trained and certified on the Mendix Modeler, the Platform Portal, and the Developer Portal so that they can interpret and analyze alerts, graphs, and logs in the Developer Portal. For more information, please check our available [training courses](https://developers.mendix.com/training/) and [expert webinars](https://developers.mendix.com/training/webinars/) or contact the Mendix Academy (<academy@mendix.com>).

## Reach Out to Mendix Support

If you suspect an issue in the Mendix Platform exists after your analysis (or if you have questions about your analysis), you can reach out to Mendix Support. We will provide pointers on how to solve the issues yourself or redirect you to Expert Services for further assistance. If we suspect a platform issue, we will involve second and third line support for confirmation, and we will fix it if it is a platform issue. If the issue is commercial (for example, because your app requires a larger app container or more file storage), we might refer you to your Customer Success Manager directly.

## Platform Status

If there is an issue in the Mendix Platform that affects multiple customers or if there is planned maintenance, we will communicate this through our [status page](https://status.mendix.com) and send updates on the progress through email if you have subscribed to this service. Having your service desk team subscribe to updates from this page is recommended.

## Product Support Period

Mendix supports the current major release and the two prior major releases (and we support each major release for a minimum of 24 months). Because of this, we recommend that you upgrade your projects to the latest version of the Mendix Modeler at least once a year. We will reach out to you in time if you are running on a version that will become unsupported so that you have ample time to perform an upgrade.
