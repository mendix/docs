#### New Features

<<<<<<< HEAD
* We added support for [Desktop Modeler 7.16](../desktop-modeler/7.16). The Web Modeler supports ranges for the Mendix Desktop Modeler. This gives you choice in whether to update the Web Modeler right away, or postpone the update. For more information on the topic, see [Web Modeler Versions and Mendix Versions Correlation](/refguide/web-modeler/versions-wm).

* We introduced a brand new expressions functionality in the microflow editor. You can now write a custom expression when configuring microflow activities. This enhances the cases that you can configure in the microflows and makes microflows far more powerful and flexible. Configure a condition in an **Exclusive Split** activity, initialize values for **Create Object** and **Create Variable** activities, set values for **Change Object** and **Change Variable** activities, set a return value for the **End Event**.
* We added the **Aggregate List** activity to the microflow editor. You can use this activity to calculate aggregated values such as the maximum, minimum, sum, average and total amount of values in a list of objects.         

#### Fixes

*  We fixed the issue where it was impossible to deploy an app or open a project in the Desktop Modeler after **Auto Arrange** in the domain model editor was used.
