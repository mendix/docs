## 1 Introduction {#introduction}

The [OpenAI Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220472) allows you to integrate generative AI into your Mendix app. It is compatible with [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/) as well as [Azure's OpenAI service](https://oai.azure.com/). 

The current scope covers text generation use cases based on the [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat), image generation use cases based on the [Image Generations API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images), and embeddings use cases based on the [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings).

Mendix provides dual-platform support for both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases {#use-cases}

The OpenAI Connector is commonly used for text generation, image generation, and embeddings. These use cases as described in more detail below.

#### 1.1.1 Text Generation {#use-cases-text}

* Develop interactive AI chatbots and virtual assistants that can carry out conversations in a natural and engaging manner. 
* Use OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs) for text comprehension and analysis use cases such as summarization, synthesis, and answering questions about large amounts of text.
* Fine-tune the OpenAI models on a specific task or domain by training them on custom data to improve their performance. 
* Integrate more easily with OpenAI’s platform. By providing text generation models, this allows you to build applications with the following features:
    * Draft documents 
    * Write computer code 
    * Answer questions about a knowledge base 
    * Analyze texts 
    * Give software a natural language interface 
    * Tutor in a range of subjects 
    * Translate languages 
    * Simulate characters for games
    * Image to text

OpenAI provides market-leading LLM capabilities with GPT-4:

* Advanced reasoning – Follow complex instructions in natural language and solve difficult problems with accuracy. 
* Creativity – Generate, edit, and iterate with end-users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning an end-user’s writing style.
* Longer context – GPT-4 can handle over 25,000 words of text, allowing for use cases like long-form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis. 

#### 1.1.2 Image Generation {#use-cases-images}

Generate one or more completely new, original images and art from a text description. Powered by the OpenAI DALL-E models, the connector enables developers to generate these images by combining concepts, attributes, and styles.

#### 1.1.3 Embeddings {#use-cases-embeddings}

Convert strings into vector embeddings for various purposes based on the relatedness of texts.

Embeddings are commonly used for the following:

* Search 
* Clustering 
* Recommendations 
* Anomaly detection 
* Diversity measurement 
* Classification 

Combine embeddings with text generation capabilities and leverage specific sources of information to create a smart chat functionality tailored to your own knowledge base.

To import the OpenAI Connector into your app, follow the instructions in [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/use-content/).

## 3 Configuration {#configuration}

After you install the OpenAI Connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **Marketplace Modules** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to OpenAI. To implement an activity, use it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to OpenAI, you must also [configure the Encryption module](/appstore/modules/encryption/#configuration). 

### 3.1 General Configuration {#general-configuration}

1. Add the module role **OpenAIConnector.Administrator** to your Administrator user role in the security settings of your app. 
2. Add the **Configuration_Overview** page (**USE_ME > Configuration**) to your navigation, or add the **Snippet_Configurations** to a page that is already part of your navigation. 
3. Continue setting up your OpenAI configuration at runtime. Follow the instructions in either [OpenAI Configuration](#openai-configuration) or [Azure OpenAI Configuration](#azure-openai-configuration), depending on which platform you are using.

#### 3.1.1 OpenAI Configuration {#openai-configuration} 

The following inputs are required for the OpenAI configuration: 

| Parameter   | Value                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DisplayName | This is the name identifier of a configuration (for example, *MyConfiguration*). |
| API type    | Select `OpenAI`.<br />For more information, see the [ENUM_ApiType](#enum-apitype) section. |
| Endpoint    | This is the API endpoint (for example, `https://api.openai.com/v1`)   |
| API key     | This is the access token to authorize your API call. <br />To get an API, follow these steps:<ol><li>Create an account and sign in at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).</li><li> Go to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to create a new secret key. </li><li>Copy the API key and save this somewhere safe.</li></ol> |

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you have signed up for an OpenAI account and are using free trial credits, note that the credits are only valid for three months after the account is created (not after the API key is created). To continue using the OpenAI API with an account that is more than three months old, you must top up your account balance with credit and create a new API key. For more details, see the [OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).
{{% /alert %}}

#### 3.1.2 Azure OpenAI Configuration {#azure-openai-configuration} 

The following inputs are required for the Azure OpenAI configuration: 

| Parameter      | Value                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DisplayName    | This is the name identifier of a configuration (for example, *MyConfiguration*). |
| API type       | Select `AzureOpenAI`.<br />For more information, see the [ENUM_ApiType](#enum-apitype) section. |
| Endpoint       | This is the API endpoint (for example, `https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/`).<br />For details on how to obtain `your-resource-name`, see the [Obtaining Azure OpenAI Resource Name](#azure-resource-name) section below. |
| DeploymentName | This is the deployment name you chose when you deployed the model. Deployments provide endpoints to the Azure OpenAI base models or your fine-tuned models.<br />To check the deployment name, go to [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/) and check the deployment name under **Deployments**. |
| API version    | This is the API version to use for this operation. It follows the `yyyy-MM-dd` format. For supported versions, see [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference). The supported versions can vary depending on the type of model, so make sure to look for the right section (such as Chat Completions, Image Generation, or Embeddings) on that page. |
| API key        | This is the access token to authorize your API call.         |
| Key type       | This is the type of token that is entered in the API key field. For Azure OpenAI, two types of keys are currently supported: Microsoft Entra token and API key. <br />For details on how to generate a Microsoft Entra access token, see [How to Configure Azure OpenAI Service with Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity). Alternatively, if your organization allows it, you could use the Azure `api-key` authentication mechanism. For details on how to obtain an API key, see the [Obtaining Azure OpenAI API keys](#azure-api-keys) section below. For more information, see the [ENUM_KeyType](#enum-keytype) section. |

{{% alert color="info" %}}
For the Azure OpenAI configuration, each model needs a separate deployment so that it can be used. In order to benefit from multiple supported operations in your Mendix app, you need to create multiple configuration objects—one for every deployed model. For details, see the [Azure OpenAI Service REST API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/ai-services/openai/reference).

##### 3.1.2.1 Obtaining the Azure OpenAI Resource Name {#azure-resource-name}

1. Go to the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign in.
2. In the upper-right corner, click **Settings** ({{% icon name="cog" %}}). 
3. Go to the **Resource** tab.
4. Go to **Current resource** and click **JSON view**.
5. Use the value of the **Name** field as your resource name in the endpoint URL.

##### 3.1.2.2 Obtaining the Azure OpenAI API keys {#azure-api-keys}

1. Go to the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign in.
2. In the upper-right corner, click **Settings** ({{% icon name="cog" %}}). 
3. Go to the **Resource** tab.
4. Go to **Current resource** and click **JSON view**.
5. Use the value of the **key1** or **key2** field as your API key while setting up the configuration. Note that these keys might not be available, depending on your organization's security settings. 

### 3.2 Chat Completions Configuration {#chat-completions-configuration} 

After following the general setup above, you are all set to use the microflows in the **USE_ME > Operations > ChatCompletions** folder in your logic. Currently, two microflows for chat completions are exposed as microflow actions under the **OpenAI Operations** category in the **Toolbox** in Mendix Studio Pro. 

These microflows expect an [OpenAIConnection](#openaiconnection) object that refers to a [Configuration](#configuration-entity). Additionally, a model or deployment needs to be passed:

* For the OpenAI API configuration, the desired model must be specified for every call in the Model attribute of the [OpenAIConnection](#openaiconnection).
* For the Azure OpenAI configuration, the model is already determined by the deployment in the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal) that was set on the referenced [Configuration](#configuration-entity). Any model explicitly specified will be ignored and hence can be left empty. 

In the context of chat completions, system prompts and user prompts are two key components that help guide the language model in generating relevant and contextually appropriate responses. For more information on prompt engineering, see the [Read More](#read-more) section. Different exposed microflow activities may require different prompts and logic for how the prompts must be passed, as described in the following sections. For more information on message roles, see the [ENUM_MessageRole](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#enum-messagerole) section in *GenAI Commons*.

All chat completions operations within the OpenAI connector support [JSON mode](#enum-responseformat-chat), [function calling](#chatcompletions-functioncalling), and [vision](#chatcompletions-vision).

For more inspiration or guidance on how to use the above-mentioned microflows in your logic, Mendix recommends downloading our [showcase app](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475), which demonstrates a variety of examples. 

#### 3.2.1 Chat Completions (without History) {#chatcompletions-without-history}

The microflow activity `Chat Completions (without history)` supports scenarios where there is no need to send a list of (historic) messages comprising the conversation so far as part of the request. The operation requires a specialized [Connection](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#connection) of type [OpenAIConnection](#openaiconnection) and a UserPrompt as a string. Additional parameters, such as system prompt, can be passed via the optional [Request](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#request) object and the optionally referenced [OpenAIRequest_Extension](#openairequest-extension) for OpenAI-specific optional attributes.

Functionally, the prompt strings can be written in a specific way and can be tailored to get the desired result and behavior. For more information on prompt engineering, see the [Read More](#read-more) section.

Optionally, you can also use [function calling](#chatcompletions-functioncalling) by adding a [ToolCollection](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#add-function-to-request) to the Request. Or you can [send images](#chatcompletions-vision) along with the user prompt by passing a [FileCollection](#initialize-filecollection).

For technical details, see the [Technical Reference](#chat-completions-without-history-technical) section.

#### 3.2.2 Chat Completions (with History) {#chatcompletions-with-with-history}

The microflow activity `Chat completions (with history)` supports more complex use cases where a list of (historical) messages (for example, the conversation or context so far) is sent as part of the request to the LLM. The operation requires a specialized [Connection](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#connection) of type [OpenAIConnection](#openaiconnection), a [Request](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#request) object containing messages, optional attributes, an optional `ToolCollection`, and the optionally referenced [OpenAIRequest_Extension](#openairequest-extension) for OpenAI-specific optional attributes.

Optionally, you can use [function calling](#chatcompletions-functioncalling) by adding a [ToolCollection](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#add-function-to-request) to the Request. Or you can [send images](#chatcompletions-vision) along with the user prompt by passing a [FileCollection](#initialize-filecollection).

For technical details, see the [Technical Reference](#chat-completions-with-history-technical) section.

#### 3.2.3 Function Calling {#chatcompletions-functioncalling}

Function calling enables LLMs to connect with external tools to gather information, execute actions, convert natural language into structured data, and much more. Function calling thus enables the model to intelligently decide when to let the Mendix app call one or more predefined function microflows to gather additional information to include in the assistant's response.

OpenAI does not call the function. The model returns a tool called JSON structure that is used to build the input of the function (or functions) so that they can be executed as part of the chat completions operation. Functions in Mendix are essentially microflows that can be registered within the request to the LLM​. The OpenAI connector takes care of handling the tool call response as well as executing the function microflows until the API returns the assistant's final response.

Function microflows take a single input parameter of type string and must return a string.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Function calling is a very powerful capability and should be used with caution. Function microflows run in the context of the current user, without enforcing entity access. You can use `$currentUser` in XPath queries to ensure that you retrieve and return only information that the end-user is allowed to view; otherwise, confidential information may become visible to the current end-user in the assistant's response.

Mendix also strongly advises that you build user confirmation logic into function microflows that have a potential impact on the world on behalf of the end-user. Some examples of such microflows include sending an email, posting online, or making a purchase.
{{% /alert %}}

You can use function calling in all chat completions operations by adding a `ToolCollection` with a `Function` via the [Tools: Add Function to Request](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#add-function-to-request) operation.

For more information, see [Function Calling](/appstore/modules/genai/function-calling/).

#### 3.2.4 Vision {#chatcompletions-vision}

Vision enables models like GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo to interpret and analyze images, allowing them to answer questions and perform tasks related to visual content. This integration of computer vision and language processing enhances the model's comprehension and makes it valuable for tasks involving visual information. To make use of vision inside the OpenAI connector, an optional [FileCollection](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#filecollection) containing one or multiple images must be sent along with a single message.

For `Chat Completions without History`, `FileCollection` is an optional input parameter. For `Chat Completions with History`, `FileCollection` can optionally be added to individual user messages using [Chat: Add Message to Request](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#chat-add-message-to-request).

Use the two exposed microflows [Files: Initialize Collection with OpenAI File](#initialize-filecollection) and [Files: Add OpenAIFile to Collection](#add-file) to construct the input with either `FileDocuments` (for vision, it needs to be of type `Image`) or `URLs`. The same file operations exposed by the GenAI commons module can be used for vision requests with the OpenAIConnector; however, they do not support the optional `Detail` attribute of the [OpenAIFileContent](#openaifile-content) entity.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
OpenAI and Azure OpenAI for vision do not yet provide feature parity when it comes to combining functionalities. In other words, Azure OpenAI does not support the use of JSON mode and function calling in combination with image (vision) input.

When you use Azure OpenAI, it is recommended to set the optional `MaxTokens` input parameter; otherwise, the return output may be cut off.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information on vision, see [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) and [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/gpt-with-vision) documentation.

### 3.3 Image Generations Configuration {#image-generations-configuration}

To implement image generations into your Mendix application, you can use the microflows in the **USE_ME > Operations > ImageGenerations** folder. Currently, two microflows for image generations are exposed as microflow actions under the **OpenAI Connector** category in the **Toolbox** in Mendix Studio Pro.

These microflows expect a [Configuration](#configuration-entity) entity, as well as the desired AI model that should be used for generating image responses in the case of OpenAI configurations. In this case, the field is optional because OpenAI assumes a default value `dall-e-2`.

For more inspiration or guidance on how to use the below-mentioned microflows in your logic, Mendix recommends downloading our [showcase app](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475), which displays various examples. 

#### 3.3.1 Image Generations (Single Image) {#imagegenerations-single}

The microflow activity `Image Generations (single image)` supports scenarios where a single image must be generated based on the provided prompt. To implement this operation, you must create a specialization of the [GeneratedImage](#generatedimage) entity. For every implementation of this microflow, an instance of this specialization has to be created first and must be passed into the `OutputImage` parameter of the microflow. If the call is successful, the image generated by the model is stored in that object.

For technical details, see the [Technical Reference](#image-generations-single-technical) section.

#### 3.3.2 Image Generations (Advanced) {#imagegenerations-advanced}

You can use the microflow activity `Image Generations (advanced)` in cases where the above-mentioned microflows do not provide enough support or flexibility. The interface of this operation resembles the API interface. The construction of the request and handling of the response must be implemented in a custom way. The accompanying microflow `ImageGenerationsRequest_Create` is available to construct the request object as an input for the operation.

For technical details, see the [Technical Reference](#image-generations-advanced-technical) section.

### 3.4 Embeddings Configuration {#embeddings-configuration}

In order to implement embeddings into your Mendix application, you can use the microflows in the **USE_ME > Operations > Embeddings** folder. Currently, three microflows for embeddings are exposed as microflow actions under the **OpenAI Connector** category in the **Toolbox** in Mendix Studio Pro.

These microflows expect a [Configuration](#configuration-entity) entity, as well as the desired AI model that should be used for generating responses.

* For the OpenAI API configuration, the desired model must be specified for every call.
* For the Azure OpenAI configuration, the model is already determined by the deployment in the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal). Any model explicitly specified will be ignored and hence can be left empty. 

#### 3.4.1 Embeddings (Single Input) {#embeddings-single}

The microflow activity `Embeddings (single input)` supports scenarios where the vector embedding of a single string must be generated. This input string can be passed directly as the `Input` parameter of this microflow. Note that the parameter `EncodingFormat` is optional; the current version of this operation only supports the float representation of the resulting vector.

For technical details, see the [Technical Reference](#embeddings-single-technical) section.

#### 3.4.2 Embeddings (List Input) {#embeddings-list}

The microflow activity `Embeddings (list input)` supports the more complex scenario where a list of strings must be vectorized in a single API call, such as when converting a batch of text strings (chunks) from a private knowledge base into embeddings. Instead of calling the API for each string, executing a single call for a list of strings can significantly reduce HTTP overhead. The embedding vectors returned after a successful API call will be stored as `EmbeddingVector` attribute in the same `DataChunk` entity. Thus, the microflow does not return an Object or List, but only a `Success` Boolean. Use the exposed microflows [Embeddings: Create DataBatch](#create-databatch) and [Embeddings: Create DataChunk](#create-datachunk) to construct the input.

For technical details, see the [Technical Reference](#embeddings-list-technical) section.

#### 3.4.3 Embeddings (Advanced) {#embeddings-advanced}

The microflow activity `Embeddings (advanced)` can be used in cases where the above-mentioned microflows do not provide enough support or flexibility. The interface of this operation resembles the API interface. Two accompanying microflows are available to help construct the input for the main microflow: 

* `EmbeddingsRequest_Create` is used to create the request object.
* `EmbeddingsInput_Create` is used to create the input object.

The construction of the request and handling of the response must be implemented in a custom way.

For technical details, see the [Technical Reference](#embeddings-advanced-technical) section.

### 3.5 Exposed Microflows {#exposed-microflows}

You can use the following OpenAI-specific exposed microflows to construct requests via drag-and-drop. These microflows can be found in the **Toolbox** in the **OpenAI (Build Request)** section. Generic exposed microflows are described in [GenAI Commons](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#microflows).

#### 3.5.1 `Create OpenAI Connection` {#create-openai-connection}

This microflow can be used to create the [OpenAIConnection](#openaiconnection) object that is required for the chat completions operations. A [Configuration](#configuration) object is required for the input. For OpenAI  configurations (but not Azure OpenAI configurations), the model name is mandatory too.

#### 3.5.2 `Chat: Set Response Format` {#set-responseformat-chat}

This microflow can be used to optionally change the [ResponseFormat](#enum-responseformat-chat) of the `OpenAIRequest_Extension` object, which will be created for a `Request` if not present. This describes the format that the chat completions model must output.

#### 3.5.3 `Files: Initialize Collection with OpenAI File` {#initialize-filecollection}

This microflow can be used to initialize a new `FileCollection` and add a new `FileDocument` or URL. Optionally, the [Image Detail](#enum-imagedetail) or a description using `TextContent` can be passed.

#### 3.5.4 `Files: Add OpenAI File to Collection` {#add-file}

This microflow can be used to add a new `FileDocument` or URL to an existing `FileCollection`. Optionally, the [Image Detail](#enum-imagedetail) or a description using `TextContent` can be passed.

#### 3.5.5 `Embeddings: Create DataBatch` {#create-databatch}

This microflow can be used to create a data batch (wrapper entity) to group the [DataChunks](#create-datachunk). This object needs to be passed into the [Embeddings (list input)](#embeddings-list) operation.

#### 3.5.6 `Embeddings: Create DataChunk` {#create-datachunk}

This microflow can be used to add a data chunk for the given content that needs to be converted into an embedding vector. The pattern uses the DataBatch to group the inputs (see [DataChunks](#create-databatch)). The order of the chunks is not relevant.

## 4 Technical Reference {#technical-reference}

The following sections list the available [entities](#domain-model), [enumerations](#enumerations), and [activities](#activities) that you can use in your application in conjunction with the OpenAI Connector. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}

{{% /alert %}}

### 4.1 Domain Model {#domain-model} 

The domain model in Mendix is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. For more general information, see [Domain Model](/refguide/domain-model/). For more details about where the entities from the domain model are used and relevant during implementation, see the [Activities](#activities) section below.

#### 4.1.1 Configuration {#configuration-domain-model}

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-contents/modules/genai/openai/domain-model-configuration.png" alt="" >}}

##### 4.1.1.1 `Configuration` {#configuration-entity} 

`Configuration` is used to store the API credentials and endpoints in the configuration for OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.

| Attribute        | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DisplayName`    | This is the name identifier of a configuration.              |
| `ApiType`        | The value can be `OpenAI` or `AzureOpenAI`.<br />For more information, see the [ENUM_ApiType](#enum-apitype) section. |
| `Endpoint`       | This is the API Endpoint (for example, `https://api.openai.com/v1` for OpenAI, or `https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/` for Azure OpenAI). |
| `DeploymentName` | This is the deployment name you chose when you deployed the model. This is only relevant for configurations of `ApiType` **AzureOpenAI**. Deployments provide endpoints to the Azure OpenAI base models, or your fine-tuned models.<br />To check the deployment name, follow these steps:<ol><li>Sign in at [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/).</li><li>Navigate to deployments in the sidebar.</li></ol> |
| `ApiVersion`     | This the API version used for this operation. This follows the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Only relevant for configurations of `ApiType` **AzureOpenAI**. |
| `ApiKey`         | This is the access token to authorize your API call. <br />For details, see the [OpenAI configuration](#openai-configuration) and [Azure OpenAI configuration](#azure-openai-configuration) sections. |
| `KeyType`        | This is the type of token entered in the `ApiKey` field. This is only relevant for configurations of `ApiType` **AzureOpenAI**.<br />For more information, see the [ENUM_ApiType](#enum-keytype) section. |

##### 4.1.1.2 `ApiKey` {#apikey}

`ApiKey` is only used for editing the `ApiKey` to be stored in the [Configuration](#configuration-entity) entity. 

| Attribute | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `ApiKey`  | This is the access token to authorize your API call. |

##### 4.1.1.3 `OpenAIConnection` {#openaiconnection}

`OpenAIConnection` is a specialization of [GenAICommons.Connection](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#connection), which is associated to the `Configuration`. To make the operations more compatible and interchangeable with operations from other GenAI connectors based on the GenAI commons module, the chat completions operations technically accept `Connection` objects. Internally, however, they require the specialization `OpenAIConnection`, which should be created beforehand and is associated to a [Configuration](#configuration-entity) object.

##### 4.1.1.4 `ConfigurationTest` {#configurationtest}

`ConfigurationTest` is only used to send a simple [chat completions request](#chat-completions-without-history-technical) to test an existing [configuration](#configuration-entity).

| Attribute              | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `Frequency_penalty`     | The value should be a decimal between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood of repeating the same line verbatim. This attribute is optional. The default value is 0.0. |
| `_Model`                | The model to be used for an operation. This attribute should not be set directly because it will be overwritten by [GenAICommons.Connection.Model](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#connection). |

##### 4.1.2.2 `OpenAIFileContent` {#openaifile-content} 

`OpenAIFileContent` is an entity that can be passed along the request, for example when using vision. Besides the attributes from its GenAI Commons generalization [FileContent](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#filecontent), `Detail` can be used to describe the detail level of an image. The chat completions operations can be used interchangeably with `OpenAIFileContent` as well as with GenAI Commons `FileContent` objects.

| Attribute           | Description                                                  |

##### 4.2.2.2 `ENUM_ImageDetail` {#enum-imagedetail} 

`ENUM_ImageDetail` specifies the detail level of the image. For more information, see [low or high fidelity image understanding](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision/low-or-high-fidelity-image-understanding).

| Name   | Caption  | Description                                                  |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `auto` | **auto** | By default, the model uses the `auto` setting, which considers the image input size and decides whether it should use the `low` or `high` setting. |
| `low`  | **low**  | `low` enables the "low res" mode. The model receives a low-resolution 512 px x 512 px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens for use cases that do not require high detail. |
| `high` | **high** | `high` enables the "high res" mode, which first allows the model to see the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512 px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. |

#### 4.2.3 Image Generations {#imagegenerations-enumerations}

##### 4.2.3.1 `ENUM_ResponseFormat_Image` {#enum-responseformat-image}

{{% alert color="info" %}}In this case, the captions are the values that are relevant for the raw API calls, because enumeration key values do not allow certain characters or words.{{% /alert %}}

### 4.3 Activities {#activities} 

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow.

#### 4.3.1 Chat Completions {#chatcompletions-technical}

The chat completions API from OpenAI accepts a complex JSON structure that consists of a number of parameters plus one or more messages as input and generates a model-generated message structure as output. Although the chat structure is designed for facilitating multi-turn conversations (with history), it is equally valuable for single-turn tasks that do not involve any prior conversation (without history). The exposed microflows in this connector are built to abstract away the complex message structure and are meant to facilitate easier implementation in certain use cases. All chat completions operations support [JSON mode](#enum-responseformat-chat), [function calling](#chatcompletions-functioncalling), and [vision](#chatcompletions-vision).

##### 4.3.1.1 Chat Completions (without History) {#chat-completions-without-history-technical} 

Use the microflow `ChatCompletions_Execute_WithoutHistory` to execute a simple chat completions API call with string input and [Response](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#response) output not considering a previous conversation. The `Connection` object contains the relevant information to execute the API call. Optionally, a `Request` object can be passed to configure additional parameters, such as a system prompt (see the [ENUM_MessageRole](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#enum-messagerole) section in *GenAI Commons* for the difference between `UserPrompt` and `SystemPrompt`). Configure [Request](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/#request) for common parameters and [OpenAIRequest_Extension](#openairequest-extension) to use OpenAI specific parameters. If no parameters are configured, the API assumes the default values specified in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).

**Input parameters**

It generates a structure of one or many model-generated images as output. The image is returned as a URL or as a base64-encoded string. Depending on the model used, the API can return one or many model-generated images based on the input prompt plus other optional parameters. The exposed microflows in this connector are built to abstract away part of the complexity of the input and output structures and facilitate easier implementation in certain use cases.

##### 4.3.2.1 Image Generations (Single Image) {#image-generations-single-technical} 

Use the microflow `ImageGenerations_Execute` to execute a single image generations API call based on a prompt string input, where the response is mapped as an image onto the `OutputImage` object. The `OutputImage` instance must be a specialization of `GeneratedImage`. It is not required to provide the `Model`, `ENUM_Size`, `UserString`, `ENUM_Quality`, `ENUM_Style` and `ENUM_ResponseFormat_Image` values. If these optional parameters are left empty, the API assumes the default value as specified by the OpenAI documentation.

**Input parameters**

| Name             | Type                                                    | Mandatory                     | Description                                                  |

**Return value**

| Name        | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `IsSuccess` | Boolean | The value is `true` if the image generations request was successful. The value is `false` if an error occurred or a validation failed. |

##### 4.3.2.2 Image Generations (Advanced) {#image-generations-advanced-technical} 

For developers who want to configure the [ImageGenerationsRequest](#imagegenerationsrequest) object themselves and adjust its attributes according to their needs, Mendix recommends using the `ImageGenerations_CallAPI` microflow. The inputs and output are shown in the table below: 

**Input parameters**

| Name                      | Type                                               | Mandatory | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ImageGenerationsRequest` | [ImageGenerationsRequest](#imagegenerationsrequest) | mandatory | This is the request object for the Image Generations API. |
| `Configuration`           | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)             | mandatory | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key.     |

**Return value**

| Name                       | Type                                                  | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ImageGenerationsResponse` | [ImageGenerationsResponse](#imagegenerationsresponse) | This is the response object containing the generated image. |

The microflow `ImageGenerationsRequest_Create` may be used here to create and handle the input request in a custom way.

#### 4.3.3 Embeddings

The embeddings API from OpenAI accepts a complex JSON structure that consists of a number of parameters plus one or more text strings as input and generates a structure of model-generated vector embeddings as output; per input string, one vector is returned. Depending on the use case, there may be a need for generating an embedding for a single text at a time. Alternatively, in the case of processing larger amount of data, bigger texts or datasets will be split up in discrete chunks, for which embeddings can be generated using batches of multiple input texts. The exposed microflows in this connector are built to abstract away the complex message structure and facilitate easier implementation in certain use cases. 

##### 4.3.3.1 Embeddings (Single Input) {#embeddings-single-technical} 

Use the microflow `Embeddings_Execute_SingleInput` to execute a call to the embeddings API for a single string input. The output is the string representation of a vector embedding for the input. See [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings) for information on what is supported in terms of vector encoding formats. The encoding format can be left empty: if no value is specified, the API assumes the default value as specified in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create). The `Model` value is mandatory for OpenAI but is ignored for Azure OpenAI type configurations where it is implicitly specified by the deployment already.

**Input parameters**

| Name             | Type                                                         | Mandatory                     | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Input`          | String                                                       | mandatory                     | This is the input text to embed.                             |
| `Configuration`  | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)                       | mandatory                     | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key.        |
| `Model`          | String                                                       | only mandatory for **OpenAI** | This is the ID of the model to use. This is not considered for **Azure OpenAI** configurations. |
| `EncodingFormat` | [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings) | optional                      | This can be used to specify the format in which the generated vectors must be returned. |

**Return value**

| Name              | Type   | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EmbeddingVector` | String | This is the string representation of a vector embedding for the input. |

##### 4.3.3.2 Embeddings (list input) {#embeddings-list-technical}

Use the microflow `Embeddings_Execute_ListInput` to execute an embeddings API call with a [DataBatch](#databatch) input with a list of text strings, attached to the batch in the form of [DataChunk](#datachunk) objects. The resulting embedding vectors returned by the model end up in the `EmbeddingVector` string attribute of the [DataChunks](#datachunk). For details on which encoding formats are supported, see [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings). The encoding format can be left empty; if no value is specified, the API assumes the default value as specified in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create). The `Model` value is mandatory for OpenAI, but is ignored for Azure OpenAI type configurations where it is implicitly specified by the deployment already.

**Input parameters**

| Name             | Type                                                         | Mandatory                     | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DataBatch`      | [DataBatch](#databatch)                                      | mandatory                     | This is a wrapper object for a list of `DataChunk` objects with Inputs for which an Embeddings vector should be generated. |
| `Configuration`  | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)                       | mandatory                     | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key.        |
| `Model`          | String                                                       | only mandatory for **OpenAI** | This is the ID of the model to use. This is not considered for **Azure OpenAI** configurations. |
| `EncodingFormat` | [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings) | optional                      | This can be used to specify the format in which the generated vectors must be returned. |

**Return value**

| Name        | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Success`   | Boolean | The value is `true` if the embeddings request was successful. The value is `false` if an error occurred or a validation failed. |

To construct the input for the microflow, see [OpenAI Exposed Microflows](#exposed-microflows). Each `DataChunk` will be enriched with the corresponding embedding vector that was returned in the API call: the microflow `Embeddings_Execute_ListInput` already takes care of mapping the result onto the correct `DataChunk` entities, and the operation itself only returns a `Success` Boolean.

##### 4.3.3.3 Embeddings (Advanced) {#embeddings-advanced-technical}

For developers who want to configure the [EmbeddingsRequest](#embeddingsrequest) object themselves and adjust its attributes according to their needs, Mendix recommends using the `Embeddings_CallAPI` microflow. The inputs and output are shown in the table below: 

**Input parameters**

| Name                | Type                                    | Mandatory | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `EmbeddingsRequest` | [EmbeddingsRequest](#embeddingsrequest) | mandatory | This is the request object for the Embeddings API.    |
| `Configuration`     | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)  | mandatory | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key. |

**Return value**

| Name                 | Type                                      | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EmbeddingsResponse` | [EmbeddingsResponse](#embeddingsresponse) | This is the response object containing the generated embedding vectors. |

This option can be used if the default values and behavior of the `EmbeddingsRequest` are insufficient and must be changed to work for your specific use case. It is also useful if you are interested in other [EmbeddingsResponse](#embeddingsresponse) values apart from the vector embeddings. For example, it can provide usage metrics. 

The following flows may be used to construct and handle the required inputs: `EmbeddingsRequest_Create` and `EmbeddingsInput_Create`.

## 6 Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### 6.1 Outdated JDK Version Causing Errors while Calling the Embeddings API {#outdated-jdk-version}

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a framework needed by Mendix Studio Pro to deploy and run applications. For more information, see [Studio Pro System Requirements](/refguide/system-requirements/). Usually, the correct JDK version is installed during the installation of Studio Pro, but in some cases, it may be outdated. An outdated version can cause exceptions when calling the Embeddings API or other REST-based services with large data volumes.

Mendix has seen the following two exceptions when using JDK version `jdk-11.0.3.7-hotspot`:
`java.net.SocketException - Connection reset` or
`javax.net.ssl.SSLException - Received fatal alert: record_overflow`.

To check your JDK version and update it if necessary, follow these steps:

1. Check your JDK version – In Studio Pro, go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Deployment** > **JDK directory**. If the path points to `jdk-11.0.3.7-hotspot`, you need to update the JDK by following the next steps.
2. Go to [Eclipse Temurin JDK 11](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?variant=openjdk11&os=windows&package=jdk) and download the `.msi` file of the latest release of **JDK 11**.
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation steps. Remember the installation path. Usually, this should be something like `C:/Program Files/Eclipse Adoptium/jdk-11.0.22.7-hotspot`.
4. After the installation has finished, restart your computer if prompted.
5. Open Studio Pro and go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Deployment** > **JDK directory**. Click **Browse** and select the folder with the new JDK version you just installed. This should be the folder containing the *bin* folder. Save your settings by clicking **OK**.
6. Run the project and execute the action that threw the above-mentioned exception earlier.
    1. You might get an error saying `FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. The supplied javaHome seems to be invalid. I cannot find the java executable.`. In this case, verify that you have selected the correct JDK directory containing the updated JDK version.
    1. You may also need to update Gradle. To do this, go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Deployment** > **Gradle directory**. Click **Browse** and select the appropriate Gradle version from the Mendix folder. For Mendix 10.10 and above, use Gradle 8.5. For Mendix 10 versions below 10.10, use Gradle 7.6.3. Then save your settings by clicking **OK**.
    1. Rerun the project.

### 6.2 Chat Completions with Vision and JSON mode (Azure OpenAI)

Azure OpenAI does not support the use of JSON mode and function calling in combination with image (vision) input and will return a `400 - model error`. Make sure the optional input parameters `ResponseFormat` and `FunctionCollection` are set to `empty` for all chat completions operations if you want to use vision with Azure OpenAI.

### 6.3 Chat Completions with Vision Response is Cut Off (Azure OpenAI)

When you use Azure OpenAI, it is recommended to set the optional `MaxTokens` input parameter; otherwise, the response may be cut off. For more details, see the [Azure OpenAI Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/gpt-with-vision?tabs=rest%2Csystem-assigned%2Cresource#call-the-chat-completion-apis).
