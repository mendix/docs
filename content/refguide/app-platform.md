The Mendix platform takes a lightweight and social approach to enterprise project collaboration. We believe that engaging and empowering people facilitates collaboration and co-creation in any organization. The Mendix platform provides a unique combination of project management tools and social activity streams, offering a way to interact with colleagues, project team members, and even external people involved in projects.

With this collaboration platform that can be used across the enterprise, the Mendix platform breaks down walls between different departments and roles. All employees are part of the same private social network and share a wall that shows all the "company buzz." Conversations can be started and turned into ideas. Ideas are organized using a voting system and can be converted into projects. The app platform offers all the tools you expect from a social network, including two-way email integration.

Besides operating as a powerful social platform, Mendix also provides tools for managing your projects in an agile way. The social backlog management tools enable project team members and stakeholders to collaborate and to create, refine, and prioritize user stories. Each user story has its own conversation thread, which is also published on the wall for an intuitive mix of company buzz and project activity streams. User stories can be estimated and planned in sprints. The planning overview gives team members and stakeholders the ability to monitor the progress of the current sprint using scrum boards and burn-down charts as well as to plan the sprints and releases that define the future of the project.

The Mendix platform can be used separately from the other Mendix products, and its feedback widget can be included in any web application. It offers an open, well-defined API, enabling third-party developers to create their own feedback widgets, plugins, and any other innovative product they come up with.
