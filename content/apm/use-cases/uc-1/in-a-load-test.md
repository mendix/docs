In a lab a large load is generated and the statistics tool and performance tool with thresholds are used to analyse what is happening. With some filtering  the performance tool does not fill up the entire memory and still captures the longest running microflows in full detail. Extra protection is built in to stop recording when the amount of data is exceeding a threshold.

Several tests can be compared to each other by using the marker to mark microflows as belonging to a certain lab setup.
