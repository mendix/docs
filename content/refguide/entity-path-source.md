## 1 Introduction

The context source is one possible data source for a data view. Data views with this data source get their object from the context, which can be one of two things:

* A surrounding data container such as a data view or list view – in this case, the entity (path) property should be an entity path following the associations from the entity of the container
* The page parameter's value – the page parameter will contain the object that is passed to the page when opening it (either another page passing the selection of a grid or a microflow passing an object from the show page action)

## 2 Properties

### 2.1 Entity (Path)

The entity (path) property specifies the entity that will be shown in the data view. For a top-level data view, this is simply an entity. In this case, the opener of the page supplies the object that will be shown. A nested data view has an entity **path** that follows associations from the enclosing data container.
