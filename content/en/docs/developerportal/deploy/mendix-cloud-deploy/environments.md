## 2 Deploy

In the **Deploy** tab, you can find the information below about your environment.

### 2.1 Deployment Package Repository

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/deployment-package.png" >}}

In the **Deployment Package Repository** section, there is an overview of the following:

*   Deployment package
*   Version of the deployment package
*   Creation date of the deployment package
*   Uploaded by
*   Expire date of the deployment package

**Actions**

There are also four actions you can perform, which are described below.

#### 2.1.1 Creating a Package from Team Server

In this section, you can click **Create a Package from Team Server** and select a branch containing the revision you would like to build.

#### 2.1.2 Uploading

When you click **Upload**, you can upload an *.mda* file from your local device.

#### 2.1.3 Viewing the Details of the Deployment Package

Next to the deployment package info, if you click **Details**, the following items will be displayed:

* Size of the package
* Description of the package
* A build output
* An overview of the environments that are currently running on this deployment package

**Actions**

There are also two action you can perform:

* Download the package
* Delete the package

#### 2.1.4 Deploying a Deployment Package

If you click **Deploy**, the package from the team server will be transported to the environment that you select to upload.

### 2.2 Environments

#### 2.2.1 Standard Licensed Environments

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/deploy-environments.png" >}}

In this section, you have the an overview of all the available environments with the following details:

* Environment name
* Environment status
* Name of the deployment package
* The version of the deployment package
* Runtime (Mendix Studio Pro version)
* The URL of the app

There are three types of environment statuses:

*   Green – there are no alerts
*   Orange – there is at least one warning alert, but no critical alerts
*   Red – there is at least one critical alert

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The environment status is cached; there can be a delay of up to five minutes before the status icon displays a change of status.
{{% /alert %}}

To see the details of the alerts, click **Alerts**. This is documented here: [Alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health/).

**Actions**

There are two actions you can take :

* **Details** of the selected environment – information about the details available are documented here: [Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/)

* **Transport to ...** – initiates the staging of an environment to the next stage: acceptance or production

#### 2.2.2 Flexible Environments

If your node supports flexible environments you will see a slightly different format for the list of environments.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/deploy-flex-environments.png" >}}

This shows a similar list of details (the differences are highlighted):

* Environment status
* Environment name
* **PROD** will be checked if this environment is a production environment (this is set when the environment is first created)
* Name and version of the deployment package
* Runtime (Mendix Studio Pro version)
* **PLAN** indicates the plan for this environment - you can see more information about the plan on the *Details* page.
* The URL of the app

You can use the **Search...** box to find a specific environment.

**Reordering Environments**

If you are the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) you can reorder the environments by dragging and dropping:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/reorder-environments.gif" >}}

**Actions**

For flexible environments there is only one action you can take :

* **Details** of the selected environment – information about the details available are documented here: [Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/)

There is no concept of staging, and you need to deploy your app directly to the target environment.

#### 2.2.3 Setup Studios Deployment

If you are the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) for an app, you will be see the **Setup Studios Deployment** button which enables you to set the target environment to which apps will be deployed from Studio and Studio Pro. For more information, see [Studio Deployment Settings](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/).

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/setup-studios-target.png" >}}

### 2.3 Activity

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/activity.png" >}}

If you are the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) you will see the **Download to CSV** button and can download a copy of the activity log as follows:

1. Click **Download to CSV**.
2. Choose the period for which you want to download log entries. If you choose **Custom Period** you will need to enter a valid period using **Start Date** and **End Date**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments/download-activity-log.png" >}}
3. Click **Download**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Operations carried out by the Mendix Operations Desk are not currently logged on the activity log.

These are activities which are performed on a customer's behalf only with written approval through a Mendix Support ticket. 
{{% /alert %}}

## 3 Custom Domain

In this tab you can manage your custom domain certificates on an application level.

When your Mendix app needs to be accessible via your own URL (for example, `https://myapp.mycompany.com/`), you have to provide a custom domain certificate (an SSL/TLS certificate) so that we can keep serving your Mendix app via a secure connection.

There is also a section with an overview of linked custom domains.

For more information, see [Custom Domains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/).

## 4 Access Restriction Profiles {#asp}

In this tab you can manage custom access restriction profiles. These profiles can combine IP range filters and client certificate verification, then any match on either the IP range or the client certificate will grant access. Access restriction profiles can be applied to path-based access restrictions in specific environments of the application.

For more information on setting up access restriction profiles, see [Restrict Access for Incoming Requests](/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/)

## 5 Permissions {#permissions}

Here, the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) and other team members who can *Manage Permissions* can manage various permissions to the environments for each team member. Team members who have permission to *Deploy, Publish, and Monitor* can view the permissions.

For more information on managing node permissions, see [Node Permissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/).

## 6 Services {#services}

Here, the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) can decide which custom services can be used in environments of this app.

The technical contact can only see services which have been licensed for their company. If you want to license a service, you will have to raise a request with [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com). If the technical contact cannot enable the service, this means that it has previously been licensed but the license has expired.

Team members who have permission to *Deploy, Publish, and Monitor* can see which services are enabled or disabled.

Once a service has been enabled for an app, team members can selectively enable it for each [environment](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#services).
