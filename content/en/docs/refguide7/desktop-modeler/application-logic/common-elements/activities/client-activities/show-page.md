## 1 Introduction

With this action you can show a page to the end user.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

See [Microflow Element Common Properties](/refguide7/microflow-element-common-properties/) for properties that all microflow activities share (for example, caption). This page only describes the properties specific to the action.

{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Input Properties

### 2.1 Object to pass

Object that will be passed to the opened page. This object will be used by [data views](/refguide7/data-view/) with a page parameter data source.

## 3 Action Properties

### 3.1 Page

The [page](/refguide7/page/) to show to the end user. If the Object to pass is specified, the page must contain a data view connected to the same entity as the passed object (or its generalization).

{{% alert color="success" %}}

You can generate a new page to show by clicking 'Select...' and then 'New'. If you have selected an Object to pass the Modeler will automatically generate a data view to edit that object.

{{% /alert %}}

### 3.2 Page Title

By default the title of the page is determined by the page title property of the page. You can replace this title with a custom title if necessary.

{{% alert color="success" %}}

This feature allows you to re-use the same page for the New and Edit buttons of a data grid. By simply setting the titles to, for example, 'New customer' and 'Edit customer', you can save yourself the trouble of duplicating the rest of the page.
