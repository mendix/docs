## 1 Introduction

This how-to takes you through the basics of development in Mendix and teaches you how to build a simple human resources management (HRM) app.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create an app
* Manage an app
* Deploy an app

## 2 Prerequisite

To start this tutorial, create a new instance of the **Build an HR Management app** by downloading the app from the [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/61166/). After selecting the location where you will download the app project, the Desktop Modeler Version Selector will be opened. You need to select the Desktop Modeler version here in which you will open the app project.
