## Introduction

After you create some basic extensions, you want to interact with the Studio Pro model in order to make changes to your app. The Model API allows you to do just that. The model representation is exposed via the [`Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model`](xref:Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model) namespace.

## Gaining Access to the Mendix Model SDK

The easiest way to gain access to the model is by using the `CurrentApp` property of Extension class. All extension classes implement the [`Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.UIExtensionBase`](https://github.com/mendix/ExtensionAPI-Samples/blob/main/API%20Reference/Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI/UIExtensionBase.md) base class which provides this access.

The `CurrentApp` property exposes an implementation of [`IModel`](https://github.com/mendix/ExtensionAPI-Samples/blob/main/API%20Reference/Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model/IModel.md). With a `IModel` reference you can gain access to any other model elements. However, any changes that you introduce must be contained within a model transaction.

## Interacting with Model Elements

Any modification to the model must be done within a transaction; otherwise, a `System.InvalidOperationException` is thrown. There can be only a single active (i.e. not committed or rolled back) `ITransaction` for the whole app.

Transactions do not provide a way to isolate changes, but to group them. That is, any change to a model is immediately visible to all code working with the model. When transaction is rolled back programmatically or is undone by a user, all changes included in it are reverted.

To create transaction you can call [`IModel.StartTransaction`](https://github.com/mendix/ExtensionAPI-Samples/blob/main/API%20Reference/Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model/IModel/StartTransaction.md). This method will return a transaction object which implements [`ITransaction`](https://github.com/mendix/ExtensionAPI-Samples/blob/main/API%20Reference/Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model/ITransaction.md).

For your changes to reflect within the model, you must first commit the transaction by calling [`ITransaction.Commit`](https://github.com/mendix/ExtensionAPI-Samples/blob/main/API%20Reference/Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model/ITransaction/Commit.md).

Alternatively, if you wish to abort or revert your changes, you can call [`ITransaction.Rollback`](https://github.com/mendix/ExtensionAPI-Samples/blob/main/API%20Reference/Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model/ITransaction/Rollback.md).

## Examples

The most common use case for changing an app is to change one or few properties synchronously.

In the following example, an existing folder is renamed:

```csharp
using (var transaction = model.StartTransaction("rename folder"))
{
    folder.Name = "New_Name";
    transaction.Commit();
}
```

Here is another simple example. It adds an entity named `testEntity` and adds an attribute called `testAttribute` to it.

```csharp
using (var transaction = model.StartTransaction("add entity"))
{
    var entity = CurrentApp.Create<IEntity>();
    var attr = CurrentApp.Create<IAttribute>();
    entity.Name = "testEntity";
    attr.Name = "testAttribute";
    entity.AddAttribute(attr);
    var copyEntity = CurrentApp.Copy(entity);
    transaction.Commit();
}
```
