## Improvements

### Deploy

*   The loading time of the Deploy tab of a project has been decreased dramatically.

*   The "Create package from teamserver" button is now always visible. Previously it was only visible for projects that are on Mendix 5, but as most users are on Mendix 5 we dropped this restriction. Users that are not on Mendix 5 or do not have data in their Teamserver repository will be shown a pop up message stating that the feature is only available after an upgrade.
