So you’ve decided to check out your new Mendix profile page, and found it suspiciously empty. Don’t worry, I’m here to help you set up your profile, so you can show the world what a real Mendix Developer looks like!

## My Profile

The first thing you want to check out is the [My Profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/profile) page. To get there, mouse over your picture in the navigation bar and click **My Community Profile**. This overview page shows a summary of your profile, including your summary, your skills, industry experience, and badges.

When you access your profile page through the My Profile link it is automatically in edit mode, so you can easily update your profile. Click the Edit button to add a summary, new skills, industry experience, or add new social profiles on the right.

If you access your profile through the Leaderboards or Developers page, it will display your public profile. Click the Edit Profile button to go into edit mode.

## Merge your accounts

Since the release of My Community Profile you can merge your old Mendix account(s) into your current Mendix account. This action will combine all your hard-earned points, certifications and achievements in your efforts to climb the leaderboards.

How can I merge my accounts? With five quick and easy steps!

1.  Go to [your profile](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/ownprofile/)
2.  Make your profile public
3.  Click Account Settings
4.  Enter the email address of the account you want to merge with your current account
5.  Send merge request

We’ll take things from there and the email address of the merged account will be shown in the list when the accounts have been merged.

Note: with this action we only combine the accounts. We don’t deactivate the old account(s). This should be done by that company’s administrator.

## My Work

Add your Mendix project experience on this page by clicking on New Project and filling out the form. You can add a screenshot that will be shown on the My Work page, and will be visible to other developers when they visit your Work page.
