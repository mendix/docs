MendixChat is a built-in chat interface powered by Generative AI in Studio Pro. Developers can ask questions about app development in Mendix, including how to apply concepts, best practices, and development patterns. 

MendixChat is built based on large language models (LLMs), using data from [Mendix Docs](https://docs.mendix.com/), [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/index3.html#/community), and [Mendix Academy](https://academy.mendix.com/link/home).

## 3 Limitation

You can ask questions that are related to the Mendix domain knowledge. However, only limited questions can be answered at this moment. If your question cannot be answered, you will get a default reply that asks you to provide another question. Currently, MendixChat does not support follow-up questions based on your previous ones, so please keep asking new questions.
