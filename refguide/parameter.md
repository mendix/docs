A parameter is data that serves as input for the microflow. Parameters are filled at the location from where the microflow is triggered.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

When you have an object of the entity 'Customer' that you want to use in a microflow, a parameter is used. The variable name is 'EnclosingCustomer' and is shown in black. The data type is object, therefore the entity name is shown underneath the variable name in blue.
