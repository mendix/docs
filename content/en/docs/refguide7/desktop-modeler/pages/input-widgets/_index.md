Input widgets are typically used to show data to the user and allow them to edit data. The following list shows the available input widgets.

Input widgets need to be linked to an attribute in order to function. As such, they must be placed within a data widget filled by an object. [Data views](/refguide7/data-view/) are the most common input data widget, though a number of other options are available.

* [Checkbox](/refguide7/check-box/)
* [Date Picker](/refguide7/date-picker/)
