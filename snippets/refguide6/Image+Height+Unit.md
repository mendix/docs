### Height Unit

The height of an image can be specified in three ways: pixels, percentage or auto. 

| Value | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Pixels | The height is specified in a number of pixels. If you specify both width and height, the image will be scaled proportionally in the rectangle you define. |
| Percentage | The height is specified in a percentage of the container of the image. It can be larger than its original height in which case the image is stretched. |
| Auto | The height of the given image is used. |
