 **Connect a column of the data set to the series. You can do this by selecting the series, and then dragging the data set column from the Connector window to the series. Alternatively you can use the drop-down next to 'Data set column' in the Properties window to select the data set column.**

 **If you want to use every data set column as series, you can also choose 'Get series from data set' when right-clicking the report chart. If you choose this option, these series will then automatically be created.**

 **Using the Properties window, you can configure the Y-axis. Choices include its precision (ie, how many decimals are used), and whether the Y-axis should be determined automatically or if you want to enter its minimum and maximum yourself.**
