Integration with other applications (other than Mendix) can be done using REST or SOAP/Web Services. Mendix can import and export data from XML and JSON.

Integration between Mendix applications is done best with REST Services (see [Published REST Services](published-rest-services) and [Call REST Service Action](call-rest-action)). Some of the terms used the most often are explained below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
For [Call REST Service Action](call-rest-action) and JSON support in [Mapping Documents](mapping-documents), see [Consumed REST Services](consumed-rest-services).
{{% /alert %}}{{% alert type="info" %}}
For [Call Web Service Action](call-web-service-action) and support for SOAP Web Services/XML, see [Consumed Web Services](consumed-web-services).
