## 1 Introduction

The search bar contains search fields that allow the end-user to quickly find the information they need in a [data grid](/refguide/data-grid/) or [template grid](/refguide/template-grid/).

To add a search field to the search bar, right-click within the search bar in your data grid and choose **Add search field** > [Type of the search field](#search-field-type).

## 2 Search Field Types {#search-field-type}

There are three different types of search fields that can be used for different kinds of information:

* **Comparison** – Search results are filtered by comparing them to the given search term. If the search value matches the attribute value, this object will be a part of the search result. Possible attribute types: AutoNumber, Date and Time, Integer, Long, String, Decimal.
* **Drop-down** – Search results are filtered by comparing them to the given search term. If the search value matches the attribute value, this object will be a part of the search result. Possible attribute types: Boolean, Enumerations, Associations.
* **Range** –  This will apply a filter based on whether the search term falls between the values of two selected attributes. Possible attribute types: AutoNumber, Date and Time, Integer, Long, Decimal.

You cannot change the type of a search field, you will need to delete it and then add a new one of a different type.

## 3 Search Field Properties {#search-field-properties}

Search field properties depend on the type of the search field. 

An example of drop-down search field properties properties is represented in the image below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/pages/data-widgets/grids/search-bar/search-field-properties.png" alt="Search Field Properties"   width="250"  >}}

Search field properties consist of the following sections:

* [Common](#common)
* [General](#general)

### 3.1 Common Section {#common}

Properties as **Name**, **Caption**, and **Type** are common for most of the widgets. {{% snippet file="/static/_includes/refguide/common-section-link.md" %}}

However, there are additional properties that are described in the sections below.

#### 3.1.1 Custom Date Format

**Custom date format** is only available when you select an attribute of *Date and Time* type in the [**Attribute (path)**](#attribute-path) property. This property determines how the attribute value is formatted. The custom date format is a string that allows for any combination of symbols found in the table below. Any punctuation will be rendered literally. The **Format example** will show you a date example.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Search input formatting must be an exact day. Custom date formatting is not limited.

{{% /alert %}}

{{% snippet file="/static/_includes/refguide/custom-date-format-tokens.md" %}}

#### 3.1.2 Placeholder Text

**Placeholder text** is only available when you select an attribute of *Date and Time* type in the [**Attribute (path)**](#attribute-path) property.  

The placeholder text is shown if the date attribute is empty. It can be used to give the end-user a hint as to the expected format.

### 3.2 General Section {#general}

#### 3.2.1 Attribute (Path) {#attribute-path}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Comparison** and **Drop-down** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

Many input elements (like text boxes and drop-down widgets) can be connected to the following:

* An attribute of the entity of the data view that contains the widget; in this case, the widget is connected to an attribute
* An attribute of an entity associated with the data view entity by following one or more associations of the reference type through the domain model; in this case, the widget is connected to an attribute path

In the first case, we say the widget is connected to an attribute, and in the second case it is connected to an attribute path.

You can edit attributes presented in input elements over a path.

#### 3.2.2 Comparison

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Comparison** and **Drop-down** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

The value entered by the end user (or the default value in the case of hidden and read-only search fields) is compared to the value of the attribute of each of the objects in the grid. If the match succeeds, the object will be part of the search result. There are different ways in which the attribute value and the entered value can be compared. In the third column below you see the type of search field for which the comparison operator is allowed.

| Value            | Description                                                  | Search Field Types                      | Date Input Query          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Contains         | Does the attribute value contain the entered value?          | Text (attribute must be of type String) |                           |
| Starts with      | Does the attribute value start with the entered value?       | Text (attribute must be of type String) |                           |
| Greater          | Is the attribute value greater than the entered value?       | Text, Date                              | > date + 1 day            |
| Greater or equal | Is the attribute value greater than or equal to the entered value? | Text, Date                        | > date                    |
| Equal *(default)*| Is the attribute value the same as the entered value?        | Text, Date, Drop-down                   | >= date and < date + 1 day|
| Not equal        | Is the attribute value not the same as the entered value?    | Text, Date, Drop-down                   | != date                   |
| Smaller or equal | Is the attribute value smaller than or equal to the entered value? | Text, Date                        | < date + 1 day             |
| Smaller          | Is the attribute value smaller than the entered value?       | Text, Date                              | < date                    |

{{% alert color="info" %}}

For **Drop-down** search fields:  there is no limit on the number of drop-down selection options, thus a selected attribute can have an unlimited amount of unique values. However, having thousands of options which must be retrieved from the server will slow page loading considerably on older browsers. Initially hiding the search bar which contains the drop-down search field can improve page loading performance on first load. 

{{% /alert %}}

**Date comparisons and the influence of the default value**

It is possible to search on date attributes using equality. What happens with the time component belonging to the date is dependent on the default value of the comparison search field.

| Default value         | Search query                                                 |      | Result example (input: August 4, 2100)                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| None                  | Search field is empty. Represents a 24 hour date range starting at midnight of the specified date. |      | Search between August 4, 0:00 - August 5, 0:00               |
| [%CurrentDateTime%]   | Search field shows the current date. Represents a 24 hour date range starting at the _current time_. |      | Search between August 4, <current time> and August 5, <current time> |
| [%BeginOfCurrentDay%] | Search field shows the current date. Represents a 24 hour date range starting at midnight of the specified date. |      | Search between August 4, 0:00 - August 5, 0:00               |

### 3.3 Allow Multi-Select

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Drop-down** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

If this property is set to 'Yes', the resulting drop-down allows you to select multiple values instead of just one. When searching all records match for which the corresponding attribute is equal to one of the selected values. For example, you can search for all orders with status 'Submitted' or 'In progress'.

### 3.4 XPath Constraint

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Drop-down** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

If the 'drop-down' search field is connected to an attribute of an associated entity (as opposed to the grid entity itself) the XPath constraint can be used to limit objects shown in the drop-down.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Let us say you have a grid showing bicycles. In the domain model the bicycle has an association to the shops where you can buy those bicycles. You can add a search field to the grid allowing the end-user to select a shop by name. The XPath can then be used to limit the shops to those that are in a given country.
`[MyWebshop.Bicycle_Shop/MyWebshop.Shop/Country='Netherlands']`

{{% /alert %}}

### 3.5 Sort Order

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Drop-down** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

The sort order specifies the order in which the items in the drop-down search field are shown. You can sort on multiple attributes in both directions (ascending and descending). If no sort order is specified, the drop-down search field sorts on the displayed attribute.

Default: *No sort order*

### 3.6 Lower Bound

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Range** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

This attribute (path) determines the lower bound of the range.

### 3.7 Lower Bound Operator

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Range** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

The lower bound operator determines whether the comparison with the lower bound is inclusive (>=) or not (>). It can be either 'Greater' or 'Greater or equal'.

Default: *Greater*

### 3.8 Upper Bound

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Range** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

This attribute (path) determines the upper bound of the range.

### 3.9 Upper Bound Operator

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This property is available for **Range** search fields. 

{{% /alert %}}

The upper bound operator determines whether the comparison with the upper bound is inclusive (<=) or not (<). It can be either 'Smaller' or 'Smaller or equal'.

Default: *Smaller*
