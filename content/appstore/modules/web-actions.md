| Focus next | Move the keyboard focus to the next element that can be focused. |
| Focus previous | Move the keyboard focus to the previous element that can be focused. |
| Scroll to | Scroll the window to make targeted element visible. For this action, you need to provide a target selector.

| Set focus | Set focus to the element found with the selector. The element should be able to hold focus like a link, button, or input. For this action, you need to provide a target selector. This target could be an element containing a class (for example, `.mx-class-name`, `.my-class-name`), an HTML element (for example, `td`, `div`, `a`), or an element ID (for example, `#my-element-id`). |
