## 1 Introduction

In this how-to, you will improve the mobile look and feel by adding and configuring widgets in your project.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Configure several widgets to realize a rich mobile app with a native look and feel

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Complete [How to Build a Mobile To-Do App Step 2: Create the Pages](create-a-to-do-app-2).

## 3 Enhancing the Home Page

Follow these steps to improve the look and feel of the home page:

1. Go back to the Desktop Modeler.
2. Open the **Home_Phone_Default** of the *ToDo* module.
3. Open the properties of the **Description** attribute and change the following settings:

  * On the **General** tab, set **Show label** to **No**
  * On the **Common** tab, add the **text-bold** class.

4. Open the properties of the **DueDate** attribute and change the following settings:

  * Select **Custom** for **Date format**, and set the custom format to **dd-MMM-yyyy**.
  * Set **Show label** to **No**

5. Open the properties of the **List view** and change the following settings:

  * Select **Show a page** for **On click**
  * Select the **ToDo_NewEdit** page and click **Select**
  * Go to the **Data source** tab and add a constraint for the **Completed** attribute that equals **false**.
  * Go to the **Common** tab and change the **Name** to **ToDo**

6. Add a (full) **Layout grid** to the **ToDo** list view.
7. Move the **Description** and **DueDate** attributes into the **Layout grid**. This will create some spacing around the borders of your mobile screen.
8. Open the **Properties** of the **Layout grid** and add the **slide-left** class. This class will activate a page transition and, in this case, slides the page to the left when you hit the **New** button. Look at the **Mobile features** widget in the **Page layout** to see which classes are available for page transitions.
9. Open the properties of **New** button in the top-right corner of the page.
10. Change the following properties:

  * Check **Override page title** and change the title to **Create to do**
  * Use the **plus** icon for the **Icon** option
  * Select **Link** for the **Render mode**
  * Add the **flip-right** class to the **Class** option
  
11. Click **OK** to save the properties.

  * On swipe action: **Call a microflow**
  * Microflow right: **Select** > **New** > **ACT_ToDo_MarkAsCompleted** (you'll add the logic to the microflow later)
  * Swipe container right: **MarkAsCompleted**
  * Transparent swipe: **yes**
  * Hide container right: **MarkingAsCompleted**
6. Click **OK** to save the properties.

You can modify the text in the containers, but make sure the container names correspond with the container names configuration in the widget.
4. Add a **Container** below the **ListViewSwipe_MarkAsCompleted** snippet and within the **Todo list view**.
5. Change the name of the container to **Buttons**.
