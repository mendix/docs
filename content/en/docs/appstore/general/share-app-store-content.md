## 1 Introduction

The Mendix Marketplace is driven by contributions from members of the community who share the connectors, modules, and apps they have built with the Mendix Platform. This how-to shows how to add and update Marketplace content.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Add new content and promotions to share in the Marketplace
* Update existing Marketplace content

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Familiarize yourself with the [Marketplace Overview](/appstore/general/app-store-overview/) and [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/)

## 3 Marketplace Content Development Guidelines {#guidelines}

This section presents guidelines for developing content that you will submit to the Mendix Marketplace.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Submitted Marketplace content will be reviewed within five working days.
{{% /alert %}}

### 3.1 General

These are some general guidelines for creating new Marketplace content:

* Set up a separate app to build and maintain your Marketplace component
* Use a relatively recent Mendix version when creating the item, not only the latest Mendix version
* Create multiple versions of your Marketplace component (for example, for Studio Pro 7 and 8 and Desktop Modeler 7)

You can add information the end-user should know to the component [Documentation](#doc) when you are adding the content to the Marketplace.

### 3.2 For Widgets

To develop widgets and submit them to Marketplace, follow these guidelines:

* The widget should be [pluggable](/howto/extensibility/create-a-pluggable-widget-one/)
* When writing variable and function names, use lowerCamelCase (for example, *mySecondVariable*)
* Add code comments
* Use descriptive variable and function names in both XML and JavaScript
* A function should not be more than 200 lines of code
* A function should only do one thing, and it should do it properly
* Use hooks and functional components over class components
* Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
* Create test pages for mobile when content is made for mobile platforms

### 3.3 For Modules

To develop modules and submit them to the Marketplace, follow these guidelines:

* Create a folder named **USE_ME** and add the microflows and pages that are relevant for the user
* Create an empty folder with the version number as its name, which will appear in Studio Pro's App Explorer
*  If you add any **userlib** .*jar* files, make sure they are accompanied by a blank **MyModule.RequiredLib** file so that users know where the .*jar* files come from

	{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/userlibBlankFiles_boxed.jpg"   width="400"  >}}

* Verify that the module's Java actions compile correctly (the easiest way to check is to create a deployment package, as it will clean the deployment folder and rebuild the app; for more information, see [Environments](/developerportal/deploy/environments/))
* Reduce the use of layouts and use snippets instead, which will result in fewer module dependencies and will reduce the number of potential errors (for example, missing layouts)
* Implement [user roles](/refguide/user-roles/) and [security](/refguide/security/)
* Creating a new release or module export should be done while the security level of the app containing the module is set to **Production**
* The [status](/refguide/project-security/#app-status) must be **Complete** for the following access: page, microflow, OData, entity, and dataset
* For example pages and microflows to be copied to another module, select the **Exclude from project** option for the document in order to encourage duplication and reduce dependency errors 
* Do not rename entities and attributes when creating new versions, as data in these entities will get lost (replacing an existing module is based on the entity names)
* The module should include the English language

### 3.4 For Selling App Services

## 4 Adding New Marketplace Content {#adding}

To add content to the Marketplace, follow the steps in each section below.

### 4.1 Getting Started {#get-started}

To start, click **Add content** in the top bar of the Marketplace home screen. Follow these steps to continue adding content:

On the **Upload Content** page, select the type of content you would like to publish (the available types correspond to the [Marketplace home page](/appstore/general/app-store-overview/#home)):

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/category.JPG"   width="600"  >}}
	

### 4.2 General {#general}

On the **General** page,  you need to provide some details about your component. The information you entered above is pre-filled on this page.

Follow these steps to describe your content:

1. Enter a **Name** for your component.
2.  Enter a **Description** of your component.

	{{% alert color="warning" %}}You can use rich text in the editor. However, using rich text at the beginning of the description is not recommended, as the rich text will not get rendered properly. You should add a few lines of regular text before using rich text.
	{{% /alert %}}

3. The **Category** you selected earlier will be listed here. You can change this if necessary by clicking **Back** to go back to previous page..
	
	{{% alert color="warning" %}}You can only set the category in the initial version of your content. You cannot change this setting after the inital version is published.
	{{% /alert %}}

4. Depending on the category you selected, you may be asked to select a **Sub-category** for your component.
5.  Select the location where you want to publish your component:

	* <a name="public-app-store"></a>**Public Marketplace (all Mendix users)** – your component will be available to the Mendix community (this content will have to be reviewed and approved by Mendix before it is available)
	* <a name="private-app-store"></a>**Private Marketplace (your company only)** – your content will receive the **Company only** label and be available only via your [Company Content](/appstore/general/app-store-overview/#company-content) page; selected private content of a user group can also be made available to [user group guests](/appstore/general/app-store-overview/#guests) for download; this content will not be reviewed by Mendix
	
	{{% alert color="warning" %}}You can only set the location in the initial version of your content. You cannot change this setting by updating the Marketplace component later.
	{{% /alert %}}

6. Select the **Studio Pro Version** on which you built the content.
7. <a name="license"></a>Select the type of **License** you want applied to your app (if applicable):

	* [Apache V2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
	* [GNU General Public License, version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
	* [Mendix EULA](https://www.mendix.com/terms-of-use/)
	* [MindSphere Development License Agreement](https://siemens.mindsphere.io/en/terms)
	* [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
	* SDISW Development License Agreement for Mendix Sample Apps EXTERNAL
	* SDISW End-User License Agreement for Mendix Connectors and Widgets
	* SDISW End-User License Agreement for Mendix Connectors and Widgets EXTERNAL
	* SDISW End-User License Agreement for Mendix Sample Apps

	{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/general.jpg"   width="600"  >}}

6. Click **Upload an Image** to upload an icon for the component.
7. <a name="draft"></a>On each page of the upload flow, click one of the following buttons:

	* **Save Draft** to save the details you have entered so far to the [Drafts](/appstore/general/app-store-overview/#my-content) page of your Marketplace (which you can access via the **My Drafts** button in the upper right of the page)
	* **Save & Continue** to go to the next page of the upload flow

### 4.3 Package {#package}

On the **Package** page, select your content source. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you are using **Solutions**, you will not see the option to select your content source. If you are using **Solutions Template**, selecting a content source is optional.
{{% /alert %}}

* If you select **Select from GitHub**, follow the steps in the dialog box for copying the link of the release you want to import
	* To include the repo's *README.md* file on the component's [Documentation](#doc) tab, make sure you have checked the **Import Documentation** box 
	* When you are finished, click **OK**
* If you select **Manual upload**, follow the steps in the dialog box for uploading the package source file
	* When you are finished, click **Save**

If this is the first version of the component you are uploading, the number in the **Version** section of the **Package** page will be automatically set to **1.0.0**. 

Enter **Release Notes** for the component in the box provided describing what is new in that release.

Finally, you can upload a **Virus Scan Report**. Uploading a scan report is currently optional, but Mendix strongly recommends that you create this report using a service (for example, [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)). This will ensure a high-quality and secure component. Once you upload your app package or component file (for example, *.mpk*, *.mxmodule*, *.zip*, *.class*, *.csv*, *.txt*, or *.tar*) and run the scan with the scanning service, save the report as a PDF (via a screenshot, if necessary). Then, click **Upload** in the Marketplace to upload your report.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
If the virus scan report is invalid or there is some issue with it, the [Marketplace approval process](/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/#approval) will reject the component and it will not be listed in the Marketplace. Ensure you upload a true virus scan report to avoid the rejection of your component.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
If this report is not attached and during our approval process we identify security issues in your component, the component will not be listed in the public Marketplace until the issue is resolved.
{{% /alert %}}

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/package.jpg"   width="600"  >}}

### 4.4 Enable {#doc}

On the **Enable** page, you can enter details on requirements and configuration for your component in the **Documentation**. Note that this documentation option is only available when the **Import Documentation** box has not been checked (on the **Package** page above). 

Follow the template for the recommended content:

* You must fill out the following sections in order to submit your component:
	* An extended **Description** of the component
	* The **Typical usage scenario** for the component
	* The **Features and limitations** of the component
* These sections are optional:
	* Any **Dependencies** (for example, the required Studio Pro version, modules, images, and styles)
	* The **Installation** steps and details
	* The **Configuration** steps and details
	* Any **Compatibility** steps and details
	* Any **Known bugs**
	* Any **Frequently asked questions**

The editor comes with a set of basic formatting tools, such as bold, bullet lists, and URL links.

<a name="screenshot"></a>Click **Add Screenshot** to select images of the component (especially for configuration) from your computer and upload them (this is required for submitting a new component):

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/enable.jpg"   width="600"  >}}

You can optionally add a **Video** and **Demo**.
	
### 4.5 Capabilities {#capabilities}

On the **Capabilities** page, you can provide the following details about a solutions template:

* A category recommendation in the **Industry Cloud** section
* A **Banner** that will be displayed on your content page
* One or more key features to leverage in the **Solution Capabilities** section (for each capability, enter a **Name** and **Description**)
* A **Use Case** relevant to the content (enter a **Header** and **URL**)
* **External links** relevant to the content

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/capabilities.jpg"   width="600"  >}}

### 4.6 Publish {#publish}

Finally, on the **Publish** page, you can review all the details of your component you entered so far and edit as necessary (via the **Edit Section** button) before clicking **Publish Content**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/publish.png"   width="600"  >}}

After you click **Publish Content**, your draft will be reviewed by Mendix before it is visible in the Marketplace. See the next section on details for the approval process.

### 4.7 Approval Process {#approval}

All components that are to be listed in the [Public Marketplace](#public-app-store) are subject to an approval process to ensure the quality and accuracy of the listing and that the component meets the expectations of users. 

Component submissions are processed in a queue and reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis within 5 working days after submission. Mendix checks a range of requirements (for example, that the component installs properly and reports no errors, and that the documentation is clear, accurate, and of sufficient detail). 

It may sometimes take a few iterations for a component to be approved, depending on the issues identified. To avoid a high number of necessary iterations, make sure you follow the [content development guidelines](#guidelines) before you submit a component for approval.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Review and approval by Mendix is required only for the first version of a publicly-listed component. Subsequent versions of a public component do not need review or approval by Mendix.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
[Private Marketplace](#private-app-store) content does not require any review or approval.
{{% /alert %}}

## 5 Updating Existing Marketplace Content {#updating}

To update content that has already been published, follow these steps:

1.  Find the component by clicking **My Marketplace** and selecting one of the following:
	* **My Content**
	* **Company Content**
	* **User Groups** (note that if an existing Marketplace component is assigned to a [user group](/appstore/general/app-store-overview/#user-groups) as specific user group [content](/appstore/general/app-store-overview/#group-content), you can only update the component if you are a member of that group)
	
2.  Click **Manage** next to the component you want to update.

	{{% alert color="info" %}}Only one draft version of a component can exist at a time, so when one draft version is in progress, another draft cannot be started. If there is a draft version in progress, click **View draft** on the page where you manage the component in order to see the draft.
	{{% /alert %}}

3. You can edit all component details, as described in the [Adding New Marketplace Content](#adding) section above.
4.  In the **Version** section of the **Package** page, update the **Major**, **Minor**, and **Patch** numbers so that the component is saved as a new version:

	* **Major update** – a large change (which will save the component from version 5.0 to version 6.0, for example)
	* **Minor update** – a medium-sized change (which will save the component from version 6.0.0 to version 6.1.0, for example)
	* **Patch** – a small change (which will save the component from 6.1.0 to 6.1.1, for example)

5.  On the **Publish** page, you can review all the details of your component you entered so far and edit as necessary (via the **Edit Section** button) before clicking **Publish Content**.
