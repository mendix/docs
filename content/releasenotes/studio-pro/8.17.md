## 8.17.0 {#8170}

**Release date: December 15th, 2020**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.17.0" %}}

### Improvements

* You can now use [external entities](/refguide/external-entities) in a startup microflow.
* For [consumed OData serivces](/refguide/consumed-odata-services), we have optimized the retrieval of external entities so that only the attributes that are used are retrieved from the service.
* [Published OData services](/refguide/published-odata-services) and [published REST services](/refguide/published-rest-services) now send a realm in their basic authentication challenge. This is not required, but it used to be, and we want to be as compliant as possible.
* The [Delete object(s)](/refguide/deleting-objects) microflow activity is now included in **Find usages** results.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where generating a get-by-key REST operation for a file-document entity caused an error. (Ticket 109637)
* We fixed an issue where using nested data views with [non-persistable entities](/refguide/persistability#non-persistable) resulted in an error in the client. (Ticket 110682)
* We fixed an issue that result in a **StackOverflowError** during synchronization.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/index) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app project and opening it again fixes this issue.
