## 1 Introduction

An XML schema is defined in an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file and can be imported in your model. It describes what a certain XML document should look like. An example is shown in **Figure 1**. The schema can then be used in [Import Mappings](import-mappings) and [Export Mappings](export-mappings).
