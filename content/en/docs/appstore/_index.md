## Introduction

Mendix Studio Pro contains a lot of core out-of-the-box widgets such as data grids and snippets. If you want to extend your application with more widgets and modules (for example, the [Forgot Password module](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1296/)), simple charts, an [Excel importer](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1296/), and other features, and make your development move even more quickly, you can use content from the [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/), as it is a robust platform for the rapid development of apps. The Marketplace contains many useful and reusable widgets and modules created by Mendix as well as by our partners and community.

This documentation of **Marketplace** presents documentation on configuring and using the latest versions of [platform-supported](/appstore/marketplace-content-support/#category) Marketplace components.

 In addition to downloading content from the Marketplace, you can upload components you have developed to share and help the whole Mendix community. The documentation also contains guidelines on [creating Marketplace content](/appstore/creating-content/) to share and sell.

For details on the Studio Pro version required for use and when the component was published, please see the specific component page in the Mendix Marketplace. For more information, see the [Marketplace release notes](/releasenotes/marketplace/).

## Types of Marketplace Components {#components-type}

The Marketplace offers the following content types: 

| Type                              | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Module](/appstore/modules/)      | Software functionality that can include a data model, logic, and UI with a portable security model. |
| [Widget](/appstore/widgets/)      | Single user-interface elements like containers, drop-down menus, and buttons. Select a widget, configure it, and add it to pages and snippets in your app. |
| **Service**                       | Software functionality that can be re-used for different use cases. Services usually include APIs that you can interact with by configuring a connection in the app’s module. |
| <a id="industry"></a>**Solution** | Out-of-the-box solutions that are aimed at industry and domain problems, delivering instant value. These solutions are usually at least 80% ready for use and need minimal adaptation to make them work for a customer-specific use case. |
| **Sample**                        | A project that provides an overview of the capabilities a product can perform. The project can act as an example, sales play, demo, or template. |
| **Starter Template**              | Sample projects that have certain capabilities in place to provide a basis for you to start developing your own app. You do not need to create an app from a blank template, as you can use a template that already has some features configured. In addition, a template can have a personalized style that can be shared and used to enrich other apps with a specific design. |
| **Industry Template**             | Accelerators for implementing industry-specific processes. Industry templates increase speed-to-value and time-to-market, and they are great starting points for common use cases within the relevant industry. Contrary to solutions, industry templates are starter templates intended to provide inspiration for utilizing Mendix to create apps for industry-specific processes. They usually cover around 20% of the process. |
