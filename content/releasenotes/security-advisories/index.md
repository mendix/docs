## 1 Introduction

Mendix publishes security advisories by leveraging [Siemens ProductCERT](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html), which is a dedicated team of seasoned security experts that manages the receipt, investigation, internal coordination, and public reporting of security issues related to Siemens products, solutions, and services.
