Mendix supports aspiring solutions vendors, startups, and large enterprises in their adoption of Mendix as a development platform for their solutions. Along with the [Mendix Vendor Program](/appstore/creating-content/vendor-program/), Mendix can suport you via the Solution Vendor Program and the Startup Program. These program teams are the point of contact for any inquiries, including requesting access to early adopter-stage technologies like intellectual property protection.

## 2 Solution Vendor Program

Mendix introduced the [Mendix Solution Vendor Program](https://www.mendix.com/marketplace-vendor-program/solutions/) to support the full range of organizations—from startups to large enterprises—looking to develop solutions. Under beneficial terms, Mendix provides independent software vendors (ISVs) and startups with a Mendix license for the development and operation of Mendix apps to implement solutions for their customers.

The Solution Vendor Program enables established companies, existing Mendix partners, and startups to successfully develop, bring to market, sell, and deploy software solutions built on Mendix. The program is designed to provide simple terms, low initial investment, valuable enablement, and a win-win business model that benefits the partner as well as Mendix.

## 3 Startup Program

The [Mendix Startup Program](https://www.mendix.com/startup-program/) enables early-stage companies looking to build a software business and monetize their domain expertise by selling solutions. This program provides startups with tools and resources to develop, deploy, bring to market, and sell software solutions built on Mendix’s low-code development platform. The economic model of the Startup Program is based on a revenue-sharing agreement that enables startups to establish a profitable and predictable business model.
