## 1 Introduction 

Workflow is a new visual language in Mendix Studio Pro that allows you to build extendable processes. It is fully integrated with other visual languages, such as microflow editor and page editor. 

This how-to explains how to build an employee onboarding process using the workflow editor. 

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Creating a workflow
* Creating user tasks for different user roles
* Configuring pages for the user tasks
* Restricting page access to the relevant user roles
* Creating a decision in the workflow
* Using a microflow to extend logic of the workflow
* Testing your workflow from the perspective of different users

The how-to describes the following use case: 

You would like to build an employee onboarding process. At first, an HR specialist needs to initiate the onboarding process for a new employee. The employee's manager then steps in and select devices for the employee. The manager also needs to specify whether the new hire is working from the office or home. The Facilities department will then need to prepare a workspace. Depending on where the new hire works from (the office or home), the Facilities department will either prepare a desk or ship the devices to the employee's address. 

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Your app has the following [Workflow Commons](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117066) module. For more information on how to set up Workflow Commons in an existing app, see [Adding a Workflow to an Existing App: Using Workflow Commons](/refguide9/workflow-setting-up-app/). 

* Dashboards and metrics in Workflow Commons v2.1.0 and above depend on state change microflows. Make sure to do the following:

    * In the **App Settings** > **Workflows** tab, set **Workflow state change** to *OCh_Workflow_State*.
    * In the **App Settings** > **Workflows** tab, set **User task state change** to *OCh_WorkflowUserTask_State*.

* Make sure your app has Atlas 3. As a result of installing Atlas 3, your app should contain the following modules that Workflow Commons depends on: Atlas_Core, Atlas_Web_Content, and DataGrid.

* Familiarize yourself with workflow terms. For more information, see [Workflows](/refguide9/workflows/). 

* Make sure that the **User entity** is set to *Administration.Account* in your [App Settings](/refguide9/app-settings/#workflows) > **Workflows** tab. 

* Make sure that the domain model of the module you are working in looks the following way:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/domain-model.png" alt="Domain Model" >}}

* Make sure you have the following enumerations configured:

    * The PhoneModel enumeration:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/enumeration-phone-model.png" >}}

    * The LaptopModel enumeration:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/enumeration-laptop-model.png" >}}

* Make sure you have an **EmployeesToOnboard** page that contains a list view and has the **EmployeeOnboarding** entity as the data source:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/employees-page.png" alt="Employees Page" >}}

* Add the following pages to your navigation (pages are part of the Workflow Commons module):
    * TaskInbox
    * WorkflowDashboard
    * WorkflowAdminCenter

## 3 Setting Up Security 

### 3.1 Configuring User Roles

Administrator and User roles are part of your app by default. Now you need to create three app roles for a manager, Facilities, and HR and configure them correctly. 

Do the following:

1. In the App Explorer, open **App** > **Security** and set security to **Production**.

2. Open the **User roles** tab and click **New**. 

3. In the **Add User Role** dialog box, set the **Name** to **Facilities** and make sure that only MyFirstModule is selected, as you do not need to create a specific Facilities role for all modules. 

4. Click **OK**.

5. You need to assign the **User** user role to Facilities for all other modules. Double-click the newly created Facilities role.

6. In the **User Role** dialog box, click **Edit** in the **Module roles** section.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/edit-module-roles.png" >}}

7. In the **Select Module Roles** dialog box, tick the User role for Administration and WorkflowCommons modules where no role is selected and click **OK**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/modules-roles.png" alt="Module Roles" >}}

8. Confirm your choice by clicking **OK**.

9. Repeat steps 2-8 to create and configure the Manager role.

10. Repeat steps 2-8 to create and configure the HR role.

11. You already have the Administrator role by default, now you need to enable this role to monitor workflows, view their progress, and manage their settings in your app. Do the following:

    1. In the **User roles** tab, double-click Administrator.

    2. In the **User Role** dialog box, click **Edit** in the **Module roles** section. 

    3. In the **Select Module Roles**, find the WorkflowCommons module and select the Administrator role:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/workflow-commons-admin.png" alt="Selecting Workflow Commons Administrator"   width="450"  >}}

    4. Confirm your choice by clicking **OK**.

12. Click **OK** to save changes to security.

You have configured new app roles for Facilities, Manager, and HR, and enabled the Administrator role to monitor workflows, view their progress, and change their settings. 

### 3.2 Configuring Demo Users

You need to create demo users for the newly created app roles to be able to test your app later. For more information, see the [Testing Workflow](#test-workflow) section. Follow the steps below: 

1. In the App Explorer, open **App** > **Security** > the **Demo users** tab. 
2. Click **New**.
3. In the **Add Demo User** dialog box, set the **User name** to **demo_facilities**.
4. Set the same entity you selected for the **User entity** setting in  [App Settings](/refguide9/app-settings/#workflows) > **Workflows** tab: set **Entity** to **Administration.Account**.
5. Assign the corresponding user role in the **User roles** section: select the **Facilities** role and click **OK**.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 to add the **demo_manager** demo user.
7. Repeat steps 2-5 to add the **demo_hr** demo user.

You have configured demo users for your app. 

### 3.3 Configuring Entity Access

The next step in setting up security is to configure the entity access otherwise you might run into consistency errors and the users of your app may see too much or too little information. For more information on what the entity access is, see the [Entity Access](/refguide9/module-security/#entity-access) section in *Module Security*. Follow the steps below:

1. Open the domain model.
2. Double-click the **EmployeeOnboarding** entity to open its properties.
3. In the **Properties** dialog box, open the **Access rules** tab and click **New** to create a rule for the HR role:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/entity-properties.png" alt="Entity Properties" >}} 

4. In the **New Access rule** dialog box, do the following:

    1. In the **Rule applies to the following modules** section, select the **HR** role.
    2. In the **Create and delete rights** section, select **Allow creating new objects**. This allows HR to create a new **EmployeeOnboarding** object when a workflow is started.     
    3. In the **Member read and write rights** section, click **Set all to Read**. As the HR needs only to start the workflow, but not to change any employee information, **Read** rights are sufficient for all attributes of the entity. 

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/access-rules-hr.png" alt="Access Rules for the HR role" >}}

    4. Click **OK** to save settings.

5. In the **Access rules** tab, click **New** again to create rule for the Manager role.

    1. In the **Rule applies to the following modules** section, select the **Manager** role.
    2. In the **Member read and write rights** section, click the drop-down list for the **FullName** attribute and select **Read**. 
    3. As the Manager should be able to select where the new employee is working from and devices that they need, set the **WFH**, **PhoneModel**, and **LaptopModel** to **Read,Write**.

    4. Set the **FirstDay** attribute to **Read**.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/access-rules-manager.png" alt="Access Rules for the Manager Role" >}}

    5. Click **OK** to save settings.

6. In the **Access rules** tab, click **New** again to create rule for Facilities and User roles.
    1. In the **Rule applies to the following modules** section, select **Facilities** and **User** roles.
    2. In the **Member read and write rights** section, click **Set all to Read**.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/access-rules-facilities-and-user.png" alt="Access Rules for the Facilities and User Role" >}}

    3. Click **OK** to save settings.

7. Click **OK** in the **Properties** dialog box.

You have set up the entity access. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In some cases you may want to restrict access to the entity or to some of its attributes by configuring the access rules more specifically.
{{% /alert %}}

## 4 Creating a Workflow

To create a workflow that you will add activities to and create pages for, do the following:

1. In the App Explorer, right-click the **MyFirstModule** module and select **Add workflow** in the drop-down menu.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/add-workflow.png" alt="Add Workflow" >}}

2. In the **Add workflow** dialog box, set the **Name** to *Employee_Onboarding* and click **OK**.
3. Click the **WorkflowContext** parameter in the upper-left corner and navigate to the **Properties** pane.
4. Click the **Entity** property.  This entity will be used by the parameter to carry the business data that is added during the execution of the workflow. 
5. In the **Select Entity** dialog box, select the **EmployeeOnboarding** entity and click **Select**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/select-workflowcontext-entity.png" alt="Select WorkflowContext Entity" >}}

Good job! You have created a workflow and configured parameter properties. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/newly-created-workflow.png" alt="Newly Created Workflow" >}}

## 5 Triggering the Workflow from a Page

To start you workflow, you need to trigger it. In this use case, the workflow is started by an HR specialist who should fill in the new hire's name, the first day, and then click the **Start Onboarding** button that will trigger the workflow. 

You have an **EmployeesToOnboard** page that contains a list of all employees and has the **EmployeeOnboarding** entity as the data source:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/employees-page.png" alt="New Employee Page" >}}

The page access is restricted to the HR user role:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/page-access-hr.png" alt="Page Access" >}}

To add a button that will initiate the workflow, do the following:

1. Open the **Toolbox** and search for a **Call workflow** button.
2. Drag the button into the list view in an empty column.
3. Open properties and click the ellipsis icon in the **Workflow** property.
4. In the **Select Workflow** dialog box, select **Employee_Onboarding** workflow and click **OK**.
5. Set **Caption** of the button to **Start Onboarding**.

Good job! Now when the HR specialist clicks the button, the workflow will start:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/employees-page-configured.png" >}} 

## 6 Selecting a Device and a Location for the New Hire {#select-device}

The manager of a new employee will get a task to specify devices for the new hire and indicate whether the new hire is working from home or in the office. For this functionality you need to add activities to the workflow. Follow the steps below: 

1. Navigate to the **Toolbox** pane, find a **User task** activity, and drag it into the workflow editor.
2. Select the **User task** activity and open the **Properties** pane. 
3. To be able to differentiate this user task from other ones, set the **Name** property to **Specify_Device_and_Location**. 
4. Set the **Caption** property to **Manager: Specify Device and Location** to easily see who this task should be assigned to:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/specify-device-and-location-properties.png" alt="SpecifyDevice Properties"   width="400"  >}} 

5. Now configure the user task to be assigned to the Manager role, as only managers should specify devices for the new employee. Make sure **Assign task using** is set to **XPath** and click the ellipsis icon in the **XPath constraint** property.
6. In the **Edit XPath constraint** dialog box, type in the expression: `[System.UserRoles = '[%UserRole_Manager%]']` and click **OK**.
7. To create a page where the manager specifies details for the new employee, click the ellipsis icon in the **Page** property.
8. In the **Select web page** dialog box, click the **New** button.

9. In the **Create web page** dialog box, you can see the templates for workflow pages. Do the following:

    1. Set the **Page name** to **SpecifyDeviceAndLocation_Workflow**.
    2. Set **Navigation layout** to **Atlas_Default (Atlas_Core)**.
    3. Select the **User Task Extended** template.
    4. Click **OK**. A new page is generated based on the template you selected. This page is exclusively for this task. When you generate the first task page also a microflow is generated that retrieves data of user tasks.

10. Now you need to make sure that only the relevant information is displayed on the **SpecifyDeviceAndLocation_Workflow** page. In the App Explorer, double-click the **SpecifyDeviceAndLocation_Workflow** page to open it.
11. By default, all attributes are added to the data view with the employee details. You need to leave only the attributes related to the task and restrict the manager from changing the fields that are not part of the task. For example, the name of the employee has been entered by the HR department, so the manager does not need to change it and should see this field as read-only. 

    Do the following:

    1. Select the text box for the **FullName** attribute and go to its properties.
    2. Set the **Editable** property to *Never* to make the field read-only.
    3. Delete the **First day** date picker widget as it is not relevant for this task. 
    4. Leave **WFH**, **Phone model**, and **Laptop model** radio buttons:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/manager-form.png" alt="Form for Specifying Devices" >}}

12. Only the Manager role can access and interact with the **SpecifyDeviceAndLocation_Workflow** page, so restricting the access to this page is the next step. Navigate to the page properties and do the following:

    1. In the **Visible for** property, click the ellipsis icon.
    2. In the **Select Module Roles** dialog box, select **Manager** and click **OK**:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/select-module-roles.png" alt="Select Module Roles" >}}

13. A microflow called **DS_WorkflowUserTask_GetEmployee_OnboardingContext** was created together with the **SpecifyDeviceAndLocation_Workflow** page. This microflow retrieves data of user tasks. You need to set up security for this microflow. In the App Explorer, double-click the **DS_WorkflowUserTask_GetEmployee_OnboardingContext** microflow to open it.

14. Navigate to microflow properties and click **Allowed roles**.
15. In the **Select Module Roles** dialog box, select **Manager** and **Facilities** and click OK.

Great job! You have configured the user task for the Manager role:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/workflow-with-task.png" alt="Workflow with Specify Device User Task"   width="500"  >}}

This can be also a good time to test your app: you can create an employee, start the onboarding process, and test the first task for the Manager demo user. For more information, see the [Testing the Workflow](#test-workflow) section. 

## 7 Following Different Paths for the Hire's Location

Depending on whether the new hire is working from the office or home, there are two different processes to onboard this hire: prepare a desk in the office or send the laptop and phone to the new hire's home address. This step of the onboarding process should be done by the Facilities department.

Do the following:

1. Open the workflow editor > **Toolbox** and drag the **Decision** activity after the **Manager: Specify Device and Location** user task.
2. Decision means that the workflow path can split and follow one of the outcomes depending on the condition of the decision. For more information, see [Decision in Workflows](/refguide9/decision-in-workflows/). Open the decision properties and do the following:

    1. Set the **Caption** to **WFH?**.
    2. Click the ellipsis icon in the **Condition** property.
    3. In the **Condition** dialog box, type in the expression that will split the flow into two depending on the **WFH** attribute: `$WorkflowContext/WFH`.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/decision-properties.png" alt="Decision Properties" >}}

3. Since the WFH attribute is a Boolean, it has a `true` (when the new hire works from home) and a `false` (when they work from the office) outcome. These outcomes are added to the workflow automatically: 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/decision-outcomes.png" alt="Decision Outcomes" >}}

4. Now you need to configure what happens in both scenarios: when the new hire works from the home (true) and when the new hire works from office (false). Open the **Toolbox**, drag a **User task** activity to the **false** path, and do the following:

    1. Name the user task **Prepare_Desk** and set its title to **Facilities: Prepare Desk** referring to steps 2-4 of the [Selecting a Device for the New Hire](#select-device) section:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/prepare-desk.png" alt="Prepare Desk" >}}

    2. Configure the task to be assigned to the Facilities role only referring to steps 5 and 6 of the [Selecting a Device for the New Hire](#select-device) section and using the `[System.UserRoles = '[%UserRole_Facilities%]']` expression.
    3. Set a new page called **PrepareDesk_Workflow** for the **Page** property it referring to steps 7-9 of the [Selecting a Device for the New Hire](#select-device) section.

5. You need to make sure that only the relevant information is displayed on the **PrepareDesk_Workflow** page. In the App Explorer, double-click the **PrepareDesk_Workflow** page to open it.
6. By default, all attributes are added to the employee detail form. You need to make sure that the Facilities department will be able to view the fields but not change them. Do the following: 

    1. Select the data view with the employee details and go to its properties.
    2. Set the **Editable** property to *No* to make the remaining fields in the form read-only.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/read-only-form.png" alt="Read-Only Form" >}}

7. To restrict access to the page to the Facilities role only, follow the step 12 of the [Selecting a Device for the New Hire](#select-device) section.
8. Now you need to create a user task for Facilities when the employee is working from home. Open the workflow editor.
9. Open the **Toolbox**, drag a **User task** activity to the **true** path, and do the following:

    1. Name the user task **Ship_Devices** and set its title to **Facilities: Ship Devices** referring to steps 2-4 of the [Selecting a Device for the New Hire](#select-device) section.
    2. Configure the task to be assigned to the Facilities role only referring to steps 5 and 6 of the [Selecting a Device for the New Hire](#select-device) section and using the `[System.UserRoles = '[%UserRole_Facilities%]']` expression. 
    3. Set a new page called **ShipDevices_Workflow** for the **Page** property it referring to steps 7-9 of the [Selecting a Device for the New Hire](#select-device) section.

10. You need to make sure that only relevant information is displayed on the **ShipDevices_Workflow** page and that this page can be accessed by the Facilities department only. In the App Explorer, double-click the **ShipDevices_Workflow** page to open it.
11. Repeat steps 6-7 above to make the employee detail form read-only and to restrict the page access to the Facilities role.

Great job! You have configured the decision and user tasks on whether the new hire is working from the office or from home. 

## 8 Extending Workflow Logic

You can extend workflow logic by calling a microflow. If the new employee works from the office, you would like to show in the system that the desk prepared by the Facilities department is assigned to this new employee. This way, HR and Management will see where the new colleagues is sitting in the office. You have an **Assign_Desk** microflow that you can use. 

To call a microflow in your workflow, do the following:

1. Open the workflow editor > **Toolbox** and drag the **Call microflow** activity after the **Facilities: Prepare Desk** user task:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/call-microflow.png" alt="Call Microflow" >}}

2. Open **Call microflow** properties and click the ellipsis icon in the **Microflow** property.
3. In the **Select microflow** dialog box, select the **ACT_EmployeeOnboarding_Assign_Desk** microflow and click **Select**. 
4. Change the **Caption** property to **Assign Desk**. 
5. If you create a microflow from the workflow, parameter is added automatically:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/microflow-example.png" alt="Microflow Example" >}}

You can now add the actual desk assignment logic to the microflow, which falls outside the scope of this how-to. For more information on microflows and their properties, see [Microflows](/refguide9/microflows/) and [Microflow Properties](/refguide9/microflow/).
Now if the manager indicates that the new employee works from home, the desk prepared by the Facilities department will be assigned to the new employee and will be shown in the system. 

Congratulations! The onboarding workflow is completed, and you can test it with different roles by running your application locally. 

## 9 Testing the Workflow {#test-workflow}

Now you can test your workflow from the perspective of different users. 

For certain user roles, there are default end-user and admin pages. For example, users who have tasks assigned to them (Manager, Facilities roles) should see their task inbox and dashboards pages where they can manage and monitor tasks assigned to them:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/task-inbox.png" alt="Task Inbox" >}}

The Admin role has access to the Workflow Admin Center and can monitor all workflows, can view the progress of workflows, and change the workflow settings:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/workflow-admin-center.png" alt="Workflow Admin Center" >}}

This role is also able to manage users:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/admin-role.png" alt="Admin Role" >}}

Users who have tasks assigned to them (Manager, Facilities roles) will see their task inbox and dashboards pages where they can manage and monitor tasks assigned to them:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/task-inbox.png" alt="Task Inbox" >}}

To test your workflow, you need to switch between different user roles. Follow the steps below:

1. In the top bar of Mendix Studio Pro, click **Run locally**.
2. After your app is deployed, click **View App**.
3. In your browser, log in as an Admin user.
4. Click the user icon on the right to switch to another user role:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/user-icon.png" alt="User Icon"   width="500"  >}}

5. Switch between different demo user roles to test the use case. Do can do the following:

    1. Start the onboarding process: select the HR demo user that has **EmployeesToOnboard** as the home page, add a new employee, and then click **Start Onboarding**:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-how-to-configure/demo_hr.png" alt="EmployeeToOnboard Example" >}}

    2. Test the process: switch users, view inbox for each user, complete tasks, see how new inbox items are created for the user roles you configured at the next task in the process. 
    3. Open the Workflow Admin Center.
    4. Open the Workflow Dashboard.

Great job! You have deployed your app locally and tested your workflow from the perspective of different users. You can now work on adding more functionality to your app.
