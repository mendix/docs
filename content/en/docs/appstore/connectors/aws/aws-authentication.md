## 1 Introduction

The [AWS Authentication](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333) connector provides a way to authenticate on AWS for other compatible AWS connectors. This includes [connectors supported by Mendix](/appstore/aws-connectors/), as well as connectors developed by members of the Mendix community. If you want to develop your own AWS connector, you can use the AWS Authentication connector as a ready and reliable way to authenticate with AWS services, instead of developing an authentication method from scratch.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This document describes the process of configuring the AWS Authentication connector from the perspective of a developer building their own community-supported connector. If you use a [platform-supported AWS connector](/appstore/aws-connectors/), some aspects of the process are simplified. The following sections make a note of those differences where relevant.

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

AWS Authentication gives you the tools needed to authenticate your app with AWS services. It is a prerequisite for platform-supported AWS connectors, and may be required by community-supported connectors as well.

The AWS Authentication connector gives your app the ability to use the following types of AWS credentials:

* [Session credentials](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/extend-aws-iam-roles-to-workloads-outside-of-aws-with-iam-roles-anywhere/) - This type of credentials is valid for a limited time, for example, 1 hour. Because they are temporary, they are the recommended secure solution for most use cases. As a best practice, use session credentials to authenticate.
* [Static credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html) - These are static IAM credentials that are valid indefinitely. As a best practice, it is recommended to use Session credentials. However, you may want to use them to quickly test your connector, create a demo, or in cases where you are not able to set up and configure session based credentials.
* [Signature version 4 headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) - These credentials represent an advanced use case. You may use them together with session or static credentials to sign your request, for example, while calling the API without using AWS SDK. Some compatible AWS connectors may explicitly require this type of authentication.

You can implement the above authentication types by means of adding a corresponding activity to the microflow that requires AWS authentication (for example, in order to connect to Amazon Dynamo DB and retrieve specific information from a table). Each activity returns a Credentials object, which is then used for authentication.

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you can use the AWS Authentication connector, you must first configure the required setting in AWS. Depending on the authentication type that you plan to use, you may need to prepare the following items:

| Item | Required for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [IAM access key ID, secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) | Static credentials, signature version 4 headers | |
| [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html) | Session credentials, signature version 4 headers | When configuring IAM Roles Anywhere, you must provide a certificate that acts as a trust anchor. The same certificate is later used as the client certificate in the Mendix Developer portal. The certificate must use either RSA or EC as the algorithm. The type of the certificate must be PKCS12. |

{{% alert color="info" %}}
To configure the above prerequisites, you must have an IAM user with specific permissions. Those permissions may vary depending on the connector with which you want to use AWS Authentication. In general, the user should have the minimum access required to perform the functions of the connector.

If you plan to use AWS Authentication with a [platform-supported AWS connector](/appstore/general/app-store-content-support/#category), refer to the documentation provided with the connector for more information about the required permissions.

## 3 Installation

Follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/) to import the AWS Authentication connector into your app.

## 4 Usage

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AWSAuthentication** section. The connector provides the required domain model and activities that you can use to authenticate your app in AWS. Each activity corresponds to an authentication method, and can be implemented by using it in a microflow. For more information about implementing each authentication mechanism, refer to the following sections:

* [Session credentials](#session)
* [Static credentials](#static)
* [Signature version 4 headers](#signature-v4-headers)

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In general, session credentials are the recommended authentication method for use with your production app. Static credentials are recommended for test or demo environments. Signature version 4 headers cover more advanced use cases. For example, you can use them to supplement session or static credentials with custom code.
{{% /alert %}}

### 4.1 Implementing Session Credentials {#session}

Session credentials use Amazon IAM Roles Anywhere to assume an AWS Role. IAM Roles Anywhere is used to create a session token valid for a specific duration. The default duration is one hour. This is the recommended authentication method for most use cases.

To authenticate your app in AWS by using session credentials, first add a client certificate in the Deployment Portal, and then add the **GetSessionCredentials** activity to a microflow in Studio Pro.

#### 4.1.1  Adding a Client Certificate in the Developer Portal

When creating a trust anchor in Amazon IAM Roles Anywhere, you must provide a [certificate](#prerequisites) that acts as the trust anchor. You must then add the same certificate as the client certificate in the Developer portal.

To add the certificate, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the Developer Portal, and then select your app.
2. Click **Environments**, and then click **Details** by the specific environment to open the [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#network-tab) page.
3. In the **Network** tab, in the **Outgoing Connections Certificates** section, add the client certificate that you used to create a trust anchor in Roles Anywhere.
4. From the list, select the certificate that you added, and then click **Details**.

   {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/ongoing-connections-certificate.png" >}}

5. Click **New** .
6. In the **Details** dialog box, in the **Web Service Call name** field, enter an identifier for the certificate, for example, *MY_S3*.
    The client certificate identifier is used as input when you create the session credentials.
   {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/identifier.png" >}}

The client certificate that you added now shows as **Currently enabled**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/certificate-currently-enabled.png" >}}

#### 4.1.2 Using the GetSessionCredentials Activity in Studio Pro

After enabling the certificate, you can now configure the microflow that authenticates your session in AWS. You can do this by adding the **GetSessionCredentials** activity to a microflow.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The steps described below are required for the following use cases:

* If you are implementing the [AWS S3 connector](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-s3-connector/)
* If you are building your own connector 
* If you want to implement a [community-supported connector](/appstore/general/app-store-content-support/#category) that does not come with its own exposed microflow action that includes handling authentication. 

If you want to use the AWS Authentication connector with an existing [platform-supported AWS connector](/appstore/aws-connectors/) other than the AWS S3 connector, skip this procedure and refer to the documentation of the connector that you want to use.
{{% /alert %}}

1. Open your app in Studio Pro.
2. Create or edit the microflow that requires AWS authentication.
3. Drag the **GetSessionCredentials** activity from the **Toolbox** into the work area of the microflow.
4. Double-click the **GetSessionCredentials** activity and configure the parameters as shown in the table below:

    | Parameter | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Region** | AWS region |
    | **Role ARN** | [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the AWS role that the connector should assume |
    | **Profile ARN** | ARN of the profile [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](#prerequisites) |
    | **Trust Anchor ARN** | ARN of the trust anchor [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](#prerequisites) |
    | **Client Certificate Identifier** | The **Client Certificate Pin** visible in the **Outgoing Certificates** section on the **Network** tab in the Mendix Cloud environment |
    | **Duration** | Duration for which the session token should be valid; after the duration passes, the validity of the session credentials expires |
    | **Session Name** | An identifier for the session |

    The image below shows an example:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/microflow-get-session-credentials.png" >}}

    The activity returns a **Credentials** object that provides the required AWS authentication credentials for your microflow.
5. Continue the configuration by adding more activities to your microflow, as required by your specific use case.

#### 4.1.3 Configuring the Local Setup

To run the AWS Authentication connector locally using Studio Pro, you must add the client certificate as a runtime configuration in Studio Pro.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The steps described below are required for the following use cases:

* If you are implementing the [AWS S3 connector](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-s3-connector/)
* If you are building your own connector 
* If you want to implement a [community-supported connector](/appstore/general/app-store-content-support/#category) that does not come with its own exposed microflow action that includes handling authentication. 

If you want to use the AWS Authentication connector with an existing [platform-supported AWS connector](/appstore/aws-connectors/) other than the AWS S3 connector, skip this procedure and refer to the documentation of the connector that you want to use.
{{% /alert %}}

1. In Studio Pro, open the **App Settings** dialog box, and then go to the **Configurations** tab.
2. Create a new configuration or edit an existing configuration.
3. Go to the **Custom** tab for the configuration, and add the **ClientCertificates** and **ClientCertificatePasswords** runtime settings.

   {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/custom-settings.png" >}}

   {{% alert color="info" %}}For more information, see [Runtime Customization](/refguide/custom-settings/).{{% /alert %}}

4. Click **OK**.
5. Go to the microflow that uses the **GetSessionCredentials** activity, and then double-click the **GetSessionCredentials** activity to open the **GetSessionCredentials** dialog box.
6. Make sure that the value of **Client certificate ID** correctly indicates the position of the certificate in the runtime setting. For example, if three certificates have been added in the runtime setting, and the client certificate that you want to use is the second one, then set **Client certificate ID** to *2*. 

   {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/client-certificate-id.png" >}}

### 4.2 Implementing Static Credentials {#static}

Static credentials use a mechanism with an access key and a secret. The credentials do not have a specific validity duration, so they do not expire automatically. This authentication method is recommended for test and demo apps, or in cases where you are not able to set up and configure session credentials.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The steps described below are required for the following use cases:

* If you are implementing the [AWS S3 connector](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-s3-connector/)
* If you are building your own connector 
* If you want to implement a [community-supported connector](/appstore/general/app-store-content-support/#category) that does not come with its own exposed microflow action that includes handling authentication. 

If you want to use the AWS Authentication connector with an existing [platform-supported AWS connector](/appstore/aws-connectors/) other than the AWS S3 connector, skip this procedure and refer to the documentation of the connector that you want to use.
{{% /alert %}}

To create static credentials with the **GetStaticCredentials** activity in your app, perform the following steps:

1. Open your app in Studio Pro.
2. Create or edit the microflow that requires AWS authentication.
3. Drag the **GetStaticCredentials** activity from the **Toolbox** into the work area of the microflow.
    For some platform-supported connectors, the activity may already be present in the microflow. In that case, proceed to the next step.
4. Double-click the **GetStaticCredentials** activity and fill in **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** that you [obtained from the AWS Console](#prerequisites). You can decide how to provide them securely in your app.

   {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/microflow-get-static-credentials.png" >}}

    The activity returns a **Credentials** object that provides the required AWS authentication credentials for your microflow.
5. Continue the configuration by adding more activities to your microflow.

### 4.3 Implementing Signature Version 4 Headers {#signature-v4-headers}

Using signature version 4 headers grants you full control over the contents of the request that you send to AWS. You may want to use this method to authenticate a session or static credentials request without using the AWS console or SDK, for example, if the language you are using does not have SDK yet. For more information about signature version 4 headers, see [Signing AWS API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the AWS documentation.

This authentication method is suitable for advanced use cases. If your use case can be fulfilled with session credentials authentication alone, consider using that method instead.

To help you work with signature version 4 headers, the following sections of this document contains a description of the [domain model](#domain-model) and [Java action](#java-action) that you can use, as well as an [example microflow](#microflow) configuration.

#### 4.3.1 Domain Model {#domain-model}

The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. For more information, see [Domain Model](/refguide/domain-model/).

You can view the domain model in the **App Explorer** in the **AWS Authentication** > **Domain model** section. The following entities are relevant for signature version 4 headers authentication:

* `SigV4Builder` - This entity contains the parameters required to sign the request. It has a one-to-one association with the `Credentials` entity, which contains the parameters corresponding to the [access key ID and secret access key](#prerequisites).
    
    | Name | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `ServiceName` | The service that you want to connect to, for example, S3 |
    | `HTTPMethod` | HTTP methods, for example, `GET` |
    | `URIPrefix` | Optional prefix for services that require a prefix in their endpoint URL; leave blank if your service does not require a prefix |
    | `Region` | The AWS region where your service resides |
    | `Path` | URI from domain to query; enter `\` to leave blank |
    | `RequestBody` | The body of your request; signature version 4 headers require that the request body as part of the signing process, before you make the actual call. |
    
* `SigV4Parameter` - This entity contains the key-value pairs which you can use as REST headers, or as `QueryParameters`. The key-value pairs can be used to create the headers, for example, `Content-JSON`, or to define the contents of the query, for example, the `Action` parameter in EC2 calls.
* `SigV4Headers` - This entity is the output of the GetSigV4Headers Java action. It is used to create request headers in the custom HTTP REST call which you make towards AWS.

#### 4.3.2 `GetSigV4SignedHeaders` Java Action {#java-action}

The `GetSigV4SignedHeaders` Java action computes and provides the signed headers. It takes the following parameters as input:

* A `SigV4Builder` object
* A `SigV4Parameter` object that provides a list of headers
* Another, optional `SigV4Parameter` object that provides a list of `QueryParameters`

The output of the action is a `SigV4Headers` object.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/sigv4action.png" >}}

#### 4.3.3 Example Microflow {#microflow}

The following microflow shows an example implementation of signature version 4 headers authentication.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-authentication/sigv4microflow.png" >}}

In this example, a `SigV4Builder` activity is created and associated with a `Credentials` entity, a list of headers, and list of query parameters.

These entities are used as input for the `GetSigV4Headers` Java action, which returns a response in the form of a `SigV4Header` entity.

The values set in the response entity are used as request headers in the REST call to AWS.
