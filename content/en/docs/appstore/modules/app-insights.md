## 1 Introduction

After you have created a [mini survey](/developerportal/general/product-insights/) in the Developer Portal, use the [Mendix Mini Surveys](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/205483) module to implement your mini survey in Studio Pro.

## 2 Installation

To import this module into your app, follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/).

## 3 Configuration {#configuration}

{{% alert color="info" %}}Before you configure this module in Studio Pro, make sure you have [created your mini survey](/developerportal/general/product-insights/#create-survey) in the Developer Portal. {{% /alert %}}

1. Open your app in Studio Pro.
2. In **App Explorer**, go to **Marketplace modules** > **AppInsights_MiniSurvey** > **\_SETUP**.
3. Open the **Set API Key & mode** folder and do the following:
    1. Set the constant **APIKEY_APPINSIGHTS** to the [API key](/developerportal/general/product-insights/#obtain-api-key) that you obtained.
    2. (Optional) Configure the constant **TEST_MODE**. If this is turned on, the survey will always show.
    3. Save the changes.
4. Open the **Put Survey Widget On Template** folder, and place **Template_SurveyWidget** on the page where you would like the mini survey to appear. We recommend placing only one widget inside the primary layout page.
5. Configure how the mini survey will appear, either on-action or on-page load:

    * For the on-action option:

        1. Open the **Show Survey** folder, then copy the **ShowSurvey_OnAction** nanoflow to your own module.
        2. In the nanoflow, double-click **Create String variable**, fill in the **Survey ID** of the mini survey, and then save the changes. You can find the survey ID on the [Settings](/developerportal/general/product-insights/#survey-details-settings) tab or [Implementation](/developerportal/general/product-insights/#survey-details-implementation) tab of the survey details page in **App Insights** in the Developer Portal.
        3. (Optional) Double-click **CHANGE ME**, add your microflow or nanoflow action, then save the changes.
        4. Create a button that calls the **ShowSurvey_OnAction** nanoflow on the page where **Template_SurveyWidget** is placed. Mendix recommends renaming the flow to something that describes the original action.

    * For the on-page load option:
    
        1. Open the **Show Survey** folder, and copy the widget from **ShowSurvey_OnPageLoad** to your page.
        2. Place this widget on any page you wish to show the survey (you can use multiple **Show Mini Survey On Page Load** widgets in your app to trigger many surveys).
        3. Double-click the **Show Mini Survey On Page Load** widget, then fill in the **Survey ID**.

6. In **App Explorer**, double-click **Security**, and add the **AppInsights_MiniSurvey.User** user role to all the system roles that use the mini survey in the **App Security** dialog box.

{{% alert color="info" %}}Once the start time of the mini survey is reached, the mini survey will start running, and all the target users of the mini survey will receive the survey automatically.{{% /alert %}}

## 4 Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### 4.1 Surveys Do Not Work Locally When Running Multiple Applications

If this occurs, upgrade the module to v1.1.0 or above, and ensure to clear your browsers cached data to remove deprecated feature â€“ you only need to do this one time in your browser.
