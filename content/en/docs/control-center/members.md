A member in Control Center means a user of the Mendix platform who participates in the development process. It does not mean an end-user of an app built in the Mendix Platform.

## Introduction 

The **Members** page allows you to manage active, deactivated, and external members of your company.

## Active and Deactivated Members {#active-deactive-members}

On the **Active Members** tab and the **Deactivated Members** tab, you can see an overview of the active and deactivated members of your company.

When you click a member's name, a pop-up window opens with their member profile. The profile displays the apps of which they are a member as well as their **App role** for each app. Click **Remove** to remove the member from the app. Click an app name to go to the [details page](/control-center/apps/#app-details) of this app.

When you select members in the lists on these tabs, a context menu appears with options for exporting member details to an *.xlsx* file and deactivating (on the **Active Members** tab) or activating (on the **Deactivated Members** tab) members.

For security reasons, Mendix recommends deactivating an employee that is leaving your company (if the employee returns to your company, they can be activated as a member again).

You cannot deactivate yourself.

## External Members

On the **External Members** tab, you can see the members outside of your company who have access to at least one of your company apps.

When you click a member's name, a pop-up window opens with their member profile. The profile displays the apps of which they are a member as well as their **App role** for each app. Click an app name to go to the [details page](/control-center/apps/#app-details) of this app.

When you select members in the lists, a context menu appears with options for exporting member details to an *.xlsx* file.

You cannot activate/deactivate external members, because they belong to a different company than you.
