## Label properties

A label can be used to described the purpose of the widget to the user. The label is shown next to the widget in the user interface. If a label is configured, the widget will be rendered in the browser wrapped in a form group. See [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms).

### Show label

This property determines whether the label is rendered and the widget is wrapped in a form group.

_Default value:_ No

### Label caption

This property is shown only when Show label is Yes. This property determines what text is rendered within a label.

#### Text template

The template for the label can contain parameters that are written as a number between braces (for example, `{1}`). The first parameter has the number `1`, the second `2`, etc. Note that to use template parameters, the widget must be placed in the context of an entity (for example, inside a data view or list view).

#### Parameters

For each parameter in the template, you define an attribute of the context entity or a referred entity, of which the value will be inserted at the position of the parameter.
