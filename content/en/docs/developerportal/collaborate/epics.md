## 1 Introduction

Epics enables your team members to collaborate efficiently during the app development process. It supports the Scrum workflow and Kanban workflow. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You can currently use Epics as well as [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/). However, we recommend you not to use both of them at the same time for one app, since that will make data migration difficult later.

### 1.1 Getting Your Team Access to an App in Epics

Only a Scrum Master can give the team access to an app in Epics. To do so, the Scrum Master should open the app in the [Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/myapps), then go to the [General Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page, then go to the [Project Management](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#project-management) tab, and click **Switch to Epics**, as shown in the screenshot below. This gives everyone in the team access to this app in Epics.

To give the team access to another app in Epics, the Scrum Master needs to repeat this procedure.

### 1.2 Opening an App in Epics

Once you have access to an app in Epics, you can open it there. To do so, open the app in the [Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/myapps), and then go to the [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/) page. You will see a notification on the top of the page, as shown in the screenshot below. Click **Check it Out** to open the app.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/epics/epics-check-it-out.png" >}}

After you open an app in Epics, you can easily switch to other apps that you have access to. To do so, click the name of the current app on the upper-left corner, and then select a different app from the drop-down list.

## 2 Pages in Epics

Epics has the following pages: **Board**, **Planning**, **Epics**, and **Archive**. Some pages show look different based on whether you work in the Scrum workflow or the Kanban workflow.

### 2.1 The Board Page {#board}
