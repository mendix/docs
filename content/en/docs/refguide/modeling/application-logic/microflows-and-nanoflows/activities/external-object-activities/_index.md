When working with external object there is a microflow activity which enables you to call the service to update the state of the object in the other system.

The activities described in this document are in the **External Object Activities** section of the **Toolbox**:

The following are the integration activities you can use in your microflow:

* [Send external object](/refguide/send-external-object/) – sends changes to an external object to the publishing app
* [Delete external object](/refguide/delete-external-object/) – deletes an external object in the publishing app
