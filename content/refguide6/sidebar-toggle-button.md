Pressing the sidebar toggle button will make a region of a [scroll container](scroll-container) appear or disappear. This makes it possible to create sidebars (for example, a menu on a mobile phone that is hidden by default and can be shown by clicking the button). See the image below for an example layout that used the sidebar toggle.

The sidebar toggle used to include settings to govern which layout region was toggled and how the transition was visualized. These configuration options were moved to the [scroll container region](scroll-container-region) to improve transparency in Mendix 6.10.
