## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/) is a vibrant marketplace containing complete sample apps that can be used right away as well as various components (connectors, widgets, and modules) that can be used to build custom apps more quickly. In the Mendix Marketplace, you can browse all the content, get what you need, and share the content you have created.

This document describes the different sections of the Mendix Marketplace.

## 2 Marketplace Home Page {#home}

The home page is your entry point to the various parts of the Mendix Marketplace. Here you can perform actions such as the following:

* Click **My Marketplace** to go to pages presenting your [Marketplace activity](#my-marketplace) as well as your company's [private content](#company-content)
* Click **Get Studio Pro** to get the latest version of [Studio Pro](/releasenotes/studio-pro/)
* Click **Add Content** to [share new Marketplace content](/appstore/general/share-app-store-content/) you have developed
* Explore various [industry solutions](#industry) and[content types](#types).

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/general/app-store-overview/home-page.jpg" >}}

<a name="industry"></a>The Marketplace offers **Industry** solutions for manufacturing, financial services, and other industries.

<a name="types"></a>The Marketplace offers the following **Content Types**:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Solutions** | Out-of-the-box solutions are aimed at industries and domain problems, and they deliver instant value. These solutions can be adapted using the core Mendix Platform to fully meet your requirements. |
| **Templates** | Templates and starter apps serve as accelerators for implementing solutions to help increase speed-to-value and time-to-market. |
| [App Services](/appstore/app-services/) | App services are packages of preconfigured business capabilities provided as modules containing logic, UIs, workflows, connectors, and APIs. |
| [Connectors](/appstore/connectors/) | Connectors are for connecting data services. They have content that you can drag from the [Connector](/refguide/view-menu/#connector) pane in Studio Pro into your app.|
| [Modules](/appstore/modules/) | Modules are packages of functionality for your app. They consist of a domain model, security options, and other elements like microflows, pages, or Java actions. Modules are mostly used for complex functionality that needs business or Java logic. |
| [Widgets](/appstore/widgets/) | Widgets are single user-interface elements like containers, drop-down menus, and buttons. Select a widget, configure it, and add it to pages and snippets in your app. |
| **Platform Services** | These services for Mendix Platform integration accessible through the Marketplace include [Data Hub](/data-hub/). |

The following filter options are also available:

* **Compatibility**
* **Tags**

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only a Technical Owner for the subscription can create binding keys. When a user from your company wants to request a free trial (and there is already a Technical Owner), they will not have separate unique binding keys. The Technical Owner has to provide the binding keys to the user.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Only a Technical Owner for the subscription can edit the instance name and manage the instance’s settings on external platforms. 
{{% /alert %}}

This additional management option is only available for specific app services where necessary.
{{% /alert %}}

After you click **Create Keys**, a page appears with your binding keys. Click **Copy** for each key and manually save the keys somewhere safe.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Once you close this page, you will not be able to retrieve the keys again.
