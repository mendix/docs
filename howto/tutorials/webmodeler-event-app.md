* Add headers, buttons, and building blocks
* Configure text and building block content
* Build microflows
* Publish your app

## 2 Prerequisites

## 5 Updating the Text Design

In the **Properties** on the right side fo the Web Modeler, you can find various options for styling your text. To update the text design, follow these steps to change the styling of the subtitle:

## 6 Adding Layout Rows in the Device Viewer

On the **Home** page, below the header, add four **Action Cards** to open new pages by following these steps:

1. Select the **COLUMN** in the layout grid below the header:<br />

    <div class="alert alert-info">

    The layout grid is a widget that gives structure to your pages. A layout grid contains one or more rows, and each row can contain up to twelve columns.
    
   </div>

2. Change it to four columns under **Row Layout** > **Desktop**.
3. Select four blocks for **Tablet** and **Phone**:

4. Switch between the device profiles to preview the layout by clicking the device icons at the top of the main Web Modeler window:

## 7 Adding Action Cards

Now that the rows are set, it's time to add action cards to the columns that will serve as buttons to navigate to other pages. Follow these steps to add the action cards to the **Home** page:

1. Return to the phone view and open **Toolbox** > **Building Blocks** > **Cards**:

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step6.jpg)

2. Drag the **Card Action** to all four empty columns:

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step7.png)

4. Select the **Open Page** button for the first card and enter *Program* for its **Caption**.
5. Select the signal icon **Button** and in **General** > **Icon**, change the icon to **List alt**.
6. Set the **On Click Action** to **Page**. If the user clicks this card, a new page will be opened. You will create the page that will be opened in the next chapter.

The **Home** page is now finished!

## 8 Adding a New Page

Now that the action cards are set, they must be configured to open new pages. Follow these steps to create a new page that will be opened when the **Program** card is clicked:

1. Select the list alt icon **BUTTON** and under **Events** > **Page**, click **Select page**.
2. In the **Select Page** dialog box, click **New page**.
3. Enter *ProgramList* for the **Title** of the new page.

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step12.jpg)<br />

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    
    If you create a page in Pages (in the left navigation panel), make sure that the action card on the Home page refers to it in the On Click Action.
    
    </div>

5. Replace the header with the **Heroheader1**, like you did for the **Home** page.
6. Enter *Program List* for the the header **Title**.
7. Enter *Upcoming events* for the subtitle, and change the color to **Warning**.
8. Delete the **New** button and its container.

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step13.png)

2. In **Properties** > **Data Source** > **Entity**, click **Select an entity**:

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step14.jpg)

3. In the **Select Entity** dialog box, click **New Entity** to create a new entity.

7. Enter *Date* for the **Name** of the new attribute and select **String** as the type.
8. Click **Create** to add the attribute.

The timeline is now connected to the **Day** entity in your domain model.

## 10 Viewing Your Domain Model, Creating an Entity, and Setting Associations

After adding new entities and attributes to a page, it's always good to verify them in the domain model. You can also use the domain model editor to set the associations between the entities.

Follow these steps to create a new entity with several attributes and associate the new entity with the **Day** entity:

1. Click **Domain Models** in the left menu and then click **MyFirstModule**. The **Day** entity you created on the Program List page is already there.

5. Name the attribute *Speaker* and click **Create**.
6. Add three more attributes:<br>
    a. **Title**<br>
    b. **Description**<br>
    c. **Address**
7. Select the **ProgramItem** entity and click on the arrow to set an association.
8. Select the **Day** entity and click **Select**.

1. Open the **ProgramList** page.
2. Click the white space just below the **{Date}** text to select the inner list view.

4. Select the **Title** text widget and delete its **Content**.
5. Type *@* to get a list of available attributes you can use for this widget.

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step15c.png)

6. Select **Speaker**. This text widget will now show the speaker for an event.
7. Select the **This is your timeline detail text** text widget and replace the content with the **Title** attribute.

## 12 Publishing and Viewing Your App

You've already completed many different steps, so it's time to publish your app and see what it looks like when it's deployed. Follow these steps to deploy your app:

1. Click **Publish** in the top-right corner of the Web Modeler.
2. Click **Update** to deploy the latest changes.
3. Click **View app** when the update has completed. Your app will now open in a new browser tab.

## 14 Building the ItemDetail Page

The **ItemDetail** page will contain two items next to each other and another item below that. This means that you need two more rows.

To build the **ItemDetail** page, follow these steps:

1. In **Toolbox** > **Data Containers**, add a **Data View** to the page.
2. In **Properties** > **Data Source**, click **Select an entity** and select the **ProgramItem** entity.
2. Drag the **LAYOUT GRID** into the **DATA VIEW CONTENT** block.

## 15 Adding Content from the Modeler and the App Store

You can find elements for your pages by looking in the **Building blocks** and **Widgets** tabs in the **Toolbox**, but you can also search for additional content in the Mendix App Store.

To download a widget from the Mendix App Store and add it to your page, follow these steps:

1. Add a **Flex Container Left** to the second column on the **ItemDetail** page.
2. Add a **Call Microflow** button to the container on the right and name it *Book seat*.
3. Change the **Render Mode** for the button to **Link**.
4. Change the **On Click Action** to *Nothing*.

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step21.png)

5. Search for *progress bar* and click the download icon in the top-left of the **Progress Bar** widget to download it from the Mendix App Store:

    ![](attachments/event-app/wm-step22.png)
