    {{% alert color="info" %}}If you open a working copy using the promise-based methods but you are still using callbacks in other places in your code without passing an error callback (for example, the callback overload of the `load()` method of model elements), be sure to register an error handler on the model using `Model.setErrorHandler()`.{{% /alert %}}
* We added support for Mendix 7.22.0.
    {{% alert color="info" %}}There is a small breaking API change where the property `navigation.NavigationDocument.profiles` is now of a different type to accommodate the introduction of a new type of navigation profile. For now, these profiles can be safely casted to `navigation.NavigationProfile`.{{% /alert %}}
* We added a lock type parameter to the `unlockWorkingCopy` API.

## 4.17.0

**Release date: November 30, 2018**

* We added new working copy lock type `update`.
* We added support for Mendix 7.21.0.
* We added new working copy lock type `commit`.
* We fixed the duplicate processing of events.
* We upgraded to Node.js version 10.

| MS-621 | None | Fixed the error message from `element.containerAs*` when the container type is not correct. |
| MS-628 | None | Introduced a new document type called `Nanoflow` and a new base class called `ServerSideMicroflow`, from which `Microflow` and `Rule` now both inherit. |

## 4.5.1

| Story | Impact | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MS-461 | None | Made the `EntityType.entity` and `EnumerationType.enumeration` properties in the new DataType Metamodel public, so that they can be read without loading the model unit that contains the DataType instance. |

## 4.5.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|------|-----|---|
| MS-461 | Medium | Defined the new Metamodel for DataType. From Mendix 7.9.0 onwards, the new properties of the DataType type should be used instead of the old properties of the String type. |
| MS-328 | None | Defined the new Metamodel for microflow expressions (experimental). |

## 4.4.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|------|-----|---|
| MS-508 | None | Allow detaching elements contained by a required part property. An error is thrown if the required property is still empty after the current (synchronous) action. |
| MS-433 | None | Added the `exportModuleMpk` method to allow users to export an *.mpk* file for a specific module in the working copy. |
| MS-477 | None | Experimental classes and properties are now marked as such in the TypeScript documentation. |
| MS-519 | None | Added support for Modeler version 7.8.0. |

## 4.3.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|------|-----|---|
| MS-471 | None | Added support for Modeler version 7.7.0. |

## 4.2.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|------|-----|---|
| MS-317 | Medium | Removed `projectId` from `IWorkingCopy`, as it was never set. Use `IWorkingCopy.metaData.projectId` instead. |
| MS-377 | Medium | Added optional `locktype` parameter to the lockWorkingCopy method. |
| MS-359 | None | Added support for Modeler version 7.6.0. |
| MS-352 | Low | Fixed the initialization of default values. |

The code snippet below is an example of what was broken in **MS-352**. The default value of `layoutCall` should be `null`, but it used to be (incorrectly) set to a new instance of `LayoutCall`. This is no longer the case, and it can be fixed by initializing `layout.layoutCall` to a new `LayoutCall` instance before assigning the `layout` property.

```text
const layout = pages.Layout.createIn(this.module);
...
layout.layoutCall.layout = this.masterLayout;
```

## 4.1.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MS-287 | Low | From now on, we disallow deleting detached elements. Either delete the element directly, or re-attach it before deleting it. |
| 1196423 | None | We added a `filterUnitsByCustomWidgetId` API to enable trusted back ends to find units containing a specific custom widget type. |
| 1197518 | None | It is now possible to specify the `workingCopyId` instead of getting a randomly generated one when creating a new working copy. This feature can only be used by trusted back ends. |
| MS-216 | None | We removed the `getEditorData` internal API. |
| MS-296 | None | We added support for Modeler versions 7.4.0 and 7.5.0. |

## 4.0.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1085587 | Breaking | Moving elements now has to be done though the `detach()` function. For a full description of all the states and their meanings, see the [Element States](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/changing-things-in-the-model/#es) section of *Changing Things in the Model*. This does not affect reading models and elements. |
| 1085587 | Breaking | Creating, deleting, and changing elements is restricted by their state. For a full description of all the states and their meanings, see [Element States](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/changing-things-in-the-model/#es) section of *Changing Things in the Model*. This does not affect reading models and elements. |
| 1031416 | Breaking | The `qualifiedName` property for an element that is not attached to the model now returns `undefined`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | Elements that have no `name` property (like `DomainModel`) no longer have a `qualifiedName` property. |
| 1031416 | Breaking | When assigning an element to a by-name reference (list) property, the element must have a valid qualified name first. This means that the element itself and any named containers should have a valid name. |
| 1085587 | Breaking | The following methods have been removed from the interface `IList<T>`: `intercept`, `move`, `observe`, `peek`. |
| 1109564 | Breaking | The property `typeName` that exists on every instance of a structure has been renamed to `structureTypeName`. All static `typeName` properties on structure classes are now called `structureTypeName` as well. (Ticket 49499) |
| 1116073 | Breaking | `Model.closeConnection` now no longer calls the (success) callback in addition to the model error handler when an error occurs while sending model changes to the server. Instead, it calls the error callback, or, in case the error callback is not supplied, the model error handler. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | The behavior of `ModelSdkClient.createWorkingCopy` has been changed so that it no longer opens the working copy right away. Instead, the specified callback gets passed an `IWorkingCopy` instance, which can be inspected or used to open the working copy. We have introduced the new method `ModelSdkClient.createAndOpenWorkingCopy` that mimics the old behavior. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We renamed `Model.metadata` to `Model.workingCopy`, as that name more accurately reflects its value. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We renamed the overload of `Structure.load()` that does not take a callback to `asLoaded()`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | All the interfaces for elements that are not part of the interface of their model unit have been removed, as these were not used in the SDK and served no further purpose (for example, `pages.IWidget` and all its derivatives). |
| 1052744 | Breaking | All the properties in interfaces for elements that are part of the interface of their model unit have become `readonly` to reflect the semantics of the model unit interfaces. If you want to change the value of such a property, you have to load the element using `.load(...)`, or you can use `.asLoaded()` to convert it to the class type if you know that the element is already loaded. |
| 1189165 | Breaking | The method `Structure.deepCopyInto` has been removed. A new method `Element.deepCopy` has been added. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | The interface `IDimension` has been removed, as it was never used. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We renamed the class `IEnum` to `AbstractEnum`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | We removed setters for properties of the type `IList`. These setters were not really useful, as they required an argument of the type `IList`. |
| 1052744 | Breaking | Specifying an error callback for `Model.getAppEnvironmentStatus`, `Model.getAppUpdateStatus` and `Model.startAppUpdate` is now required. The model error handler will no longer be used. |
| 1186227 | Breaking | The interface `IDelta` is no longer exposed and has been replaced by the type `Delta`, which is a union type of all the possible delta types. |
| 1031525 | Low | We changed the return type of `Model.findModuleByQualifiedName` to `projects.IModule`. |
| 1031525 | Low | `Structure.container` is now a read-only property. |
| 1031525 | None | `Structure.container` is now an observable property. |
| 1052744 | None | We changed the return type of `validateSyntax` to <code>string &#124; null</code>. |
| 1052744 | None | Assigning a false value such as `undefined` to a property now results in the property value actually becoming `null` instead. |
| 1026781 | None | We replaced Restler with Request. |
| 1126173 | None | Added support for Modeler version 7.3.0. |
