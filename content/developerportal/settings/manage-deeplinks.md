## 1 Introduction

To go directly to the desired element of your app project in the Developer Portal, you can use deep links.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Find the App ID, Story ID, and Feedback Item Number for your app
* Create deep links for your app, story, and feedback item

## 2 Getting the AppID, storyID, & feedbackItemNr

To create a deep link, you need the App ID, Story ID, or Feedback Item Nr for the desired element in the Developer Portal.

*  For the App ID, select **Settings** > **General** – you will find the **App ID** at the bottom of the page:

## 3 Creating a Developer Portal Deep Link

If you want to provide links directly to a specific element in your app project in the Developer Portal, follow these steps:

1. Paste the URL to the Developer in your browser's address bar (i.e., `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/` or `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/`).
2. Paste the desired App ID, Story ID, or Feedback Item Number after the final slash.

The following deep links can be used:

* Specific app: `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/project/<appID>`
* Stories overview for app: `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/capture/<appID>`
* Specific story ID: `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/story/<storyID>`
* Feedback for app: `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/feedback/<appID>`
* Specific feedback item: `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/showfeedback/<feedbackItemNr>`
* Environments for app: `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/link/deploy/<appID>`
* Metrics for app: `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/link/metrics/<appID>`
* Alerts for app: `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/link/monitor/<appID>`
* Logs for app: `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/link/logs/<appID>`
