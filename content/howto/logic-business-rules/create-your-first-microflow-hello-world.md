## 1 Introduction

Mendix uses visual models called microflows to define the logic of your application. Microflows are visual ways of expressing what traditionally would be written in code. This how-to explains how you can create a very simple "Hello World" microflow.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a menu item
* Create and edit a microflow

Microflows can be triggered in many different ways (for details, see [Trigger Logic Using Microflows](triggering-logic-using-microflows)). For this how-to, you'll be using a menu item to trigger the new microflow.

To create a menu item, follow these steps:

1.  Open the **Navigation** editor, add a menu item in the desktop navigation settings, and enter the caption of *Hello World*:

2.  Click **Select...** in the **Target** section of the **New Menu Item** dialog box to open the **Select Navigation Target** pop-up window:

3.  For **On click**, select **Call a microflow**:

4.  In the **Select Microflow** dialog box, select a microflow and then click **New**:

5. Enter *HelloWorld* for the **Name** of the new microflow.
6. Save the new menu item by clicking **OK**.

## 3 Editing the New Microflow

To edit the new microflow, follow these steps:

1.  Open the new microflow by right-clicking the new menu item created in [2 Creating a Menu Item](#CreatingaMenuItem) and selecting **Go to target** from the context menu:

    You will see an empty microflow like this:

2.  Open the **Toolbox** in the bottom-right corner of the Modeler:

3.  Drag a **Show message** action from the **Toolbox** to the line between the green start even and red end event, which will insert a show message action activity:

4. Double-click the message activity to open the **Show Message** properties editor.
5.  Enter *Hello World* for the **Template** value and click **OK**:

7. Locate the new navigation item in the menu bar and click it to see the message.
