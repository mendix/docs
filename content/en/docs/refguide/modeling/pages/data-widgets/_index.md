## 1 Introduction

Data containers display contents of one object or a list of objects. 

The Data containers category contains the following widgets:

* [Data view](/refguide/data-view/) – This widget shows the contents of exactly one object. If, for example, you want to show details of a single program item, you would use a data view for this:

* [Data grid](/refguide/data-grid/) – This widget shows a list of objects in a table format. For example, a data grid can show all the orders a customer has placed. Using controls provided by the data grid you can browse, search, and edit those objects.
