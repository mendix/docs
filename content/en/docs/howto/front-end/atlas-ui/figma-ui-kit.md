## Introduction

To start creating your designs with a UI kit, you must download [Atlas UI Kit for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1291681319513425134). You can design using any components that are up-to-date with the most recent [Atlas framework](https://atlasdesignsystem.mendixcloud.com/p/dashboard).

Inside the kit you will find the following:

* Components that can be used as a library or copy/pasted 
* Widgets and layouts 

## Prerequisites 

To use the Atlas UI Kit for Figma to its fullest potential you will need the following:

* A Figma subscription (required to use the kit's file as a library)
* The Figma desktop app (download it to take advantage of Figma's best features)

## Basics

To install the Figma desktop app, go to the [Figma website](https://www.figma.com/), download the app, and install it.

## Recommended Practices

The following practices are recommended:

1. Use the library and foundations on your app.  
1. Use the global local variables for changing the colors from your components.
1. Prioritize designing components from this kit, because they are already supported on Atlas and Studio Pro.
1. Use typographies that are supported by Atlas and are in the Atlas UI Kit for Figma.

The following practices are *not* recommended:

1. Do not change the components' names (doing so will de-link them from the library).
1. Do not change the component layers' names.
