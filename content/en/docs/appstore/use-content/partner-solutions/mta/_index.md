## Using MTA with Mendix

When purchased via Mendix, MTA can be used with any Mendix cloud hosting option, with the below requirements:

* The application model being tested must be stored in the Mendix Team Server repository.
* The MTA application and the application under test must be able to establish network connectivity with the Mendix platform APIs, including the Mendix Team Server and Project APIs.

Currently, MTA cannot be used for apps using an on-premises Git repository or running in a fully air-gapped scenario.

MTA is offered as a paid add-on separate from the Mendix subscription. As a Mendix-based application, it requires a Mendix license and cloud resources, which must be obtained separately.
