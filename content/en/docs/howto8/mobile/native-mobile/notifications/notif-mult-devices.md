## Introduction

This tutorial teaches you how to send test push notifications to multiple devices.

Push notifications only work with apps created through the Mendix Native Mobile Builder. You cannot send notifications to an app inside the Make it Native app.
{{% /alert %}}

## Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Send one test push notification as described in [Use Notifications](/howto8/mobile/notifications/)

If you want to use push notifications with custom apps created with Mendix Native Mobile Builder, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Complete [How to Build a Mendix Native App in the Cloud](/howto8/mobile/deploying-native-app/) through the end of the *Making Your First Build* section

## Sending Notifications to Multiple Devices

What if you want to send messages to all your users' devices with a single button push, but you do not want to handle the GUID retrieval? The section below will address this scenario. Specifically, you will send a push notification containing a data object to your users' devices via the Push Notifications API.

### Creating a Microflow to Send a Data Object Push Notification 

Create a microflow *ACT_SendProductToAllDevices* with the following elements:

{{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/native-mobile/notifications/notif-mult-devices/SendProductToAll.png" alt="SendProductToAll"   width="300"  class="no-border" >}}

1. Add a *Product* data parameter to your microflow.
2. Retrieve the *PushNotifications.Device* entity list from a database:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/native-mobile/notifications/notif-mult-devices/retrieveDevices.png" alt="retrieveDevices"   width="300"  class="no-border" >}}

3. Drag the **PrepareMessageData** microflow from *PushNotifications/_USE ME/API* onto **ACT_SendProductToAllDevices** and configure the following:<br />
    1. Title: *myTitle*.<br />
    1. Body: *myBody*.<br />
    1. TimeToLive: *0*.<br />
    1. Badge: *0*.<br />
    1. ActionName: *sendProduct*.<br />
    1. ContextObjectGuid: *empty*:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/native-mobile/notifications/notif-mult-devices/prepareMessageData.png" alt="prepareMessageData"   width="300"  class="no-border" >}}

    **ContextObjectGuid** is set to empty since you will pass the object itself to the **SendMessageToDevices** Java action where it will be retrieved automatically. 

4. Drag the **SendMessageToDevices** Java action from *PushNotifications/_USE ME/API* onto **ACT_SendProductToAllDevices** and configure the following:<br />
    1. **Message data param**: **$MessageToBeSent**.<br />
    1. **Device param**: **$Devices**.<br />
    1. **Context object**: **$Product**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/native-mobile/notifications/notif-mult-devices/sendMessagesJava.png" alt="sendMessagesJava"   width="300"  class="no-border" >}}

5. Go to **Product_NewEdit** and drag **ACT_SendProductToAllDevices** into that page's data view:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/howto8/mobile/native-mobile/notifications/notif-mult-devices/sendProductToAllButton.png" alt="sendProductToAllButton"   width="300"  class="no-border" >}}

### Testing the Implementation

Test your new push notification capabilities by doing the following:

1. Run your native app in your device's background.
2. In your web browser, go to **Product_NewEdit** and click your **ACT_SendProductToAllDevices** microflow button. 

This will send a notification to all available devices. When you tap the notification, you will be redirected to the particular product page you modeled.

## More Java Action Explanations

For more detail on Java actions available in the Push notifications module, see the sections below.

### PrepareMessageData Microflow

This allows users to create their own user interfaces in order to alter and create a push notification message. 

### SendMessageToDevice and SendMessageToDevices Java Actions

These Java actions have the following parameters:

* **MessageDataParam** (PushNotifications.MessageData): this parameter can be generated by the **PrepareMessageData** microflow
* **DeviceParam** (List of PushNotifications.Device or PushNotification.Device): this parameter can be used to send the same message to a list of devices
* **ContextObject**: this parameter will allow any Mendix object to be passed to the notification

### SendMessageToUsers and SendMessageToUser Java Actions

Every user is allowed to have more than one device. When sending push notifications to every device of a particular user, use the **SendMessageToUser** Java action.

To send a push notification to all users, use the **SendMessageToUsers** Java action.
