A horizontal split pane creates a region that is split in two by a horizontal divider. In the client the divider can be moved up and down by the end user.

If a horizontal split pane is placed as a top-level widget in a form, it must be the only top-level widget. Apart from that, a horizontal split pane can only be placed directly in another (horizontal or vertical) split pane.

## Appearance Properties

### Weights

This property determines the ratio of the panes in percentages. Both panes are presented by an integer value in this semi-colon separated list. Please note that the sum of the two values in this list must be exactly 100.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

15;85 - this will result in a horizontal split pane with 15 percent of the height reserved for the upper pane and 85 percent reserved for the lower pane.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Animated resize

This property indicates whether resizing, by dragging the diver, is visualized in real time, or not.

_Default value:_ False

### Height

The height property determines the height of the split pane. A height of zero means that the split pane will get the default height that is defined in the theme.

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

This property only has effect if the split pane is placed in a web-layout theme. In themes with application layout the split pane will always take 100% of the available height.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

_Default value:_ 0
