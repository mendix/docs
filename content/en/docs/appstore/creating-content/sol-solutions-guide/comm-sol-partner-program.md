## Mendix Commercial Solution Partner Program

Mendix introduced the [Mendix Commercial Solution Partner Program](https://www.mendix.com/partners/become-a-partner/isv-program/) to support the full range of organizations—from startups to large enterprises—looking to develop solutions. Under beneficial terms, Mendix provides independent software vendors (ISVs) and startups with a Mendix license for the development and operation of Mendix apps to implement solutions for their customers.

The Mendix Commercial Solution Partner Program enables established companies, existing Mendix partners, and startups to successfully develop, bring to market, sell, and deploy software solutions built on Mendix. The program is designed to provide simple terms, low initial investment, valuable enablement, and a win-win business model that benefits the partner as well as Mendix.

The [Mendix Startup Program](https://www.mendix.com/startup-program/) enables early-stage companies looking to build a software business and monetize their domain expertise by selling solutions. This program provides startups with tools and resources to develop, deploy, bring to market, and sell software solutions built on Mendix’s low-code development platform.
