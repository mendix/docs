## 1 Introduction 

Collaborative development is the process of sharing app model changes when a team of more than one person is working on the app. Collaborative development allows the team members to work together on one project and easily synchronize changes using [version control](/refguide7/version-control/).

## 2 Collaborative Development Overview

Desktop Modeler users can collaborate with each other through [version control](/refguide7/version-control/) via **Commit** and **Update** operations. 

They can also perform the actions described below.
