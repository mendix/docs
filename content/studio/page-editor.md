## 1 Introduction 

Pages define the end-user interface of a Mendix application. Pages are created and edited in the *page editor*.

To view the **Pages** of your app in Mendix Studio, click the **Pages** icon in the left menu bar of Studio.

Studio supports apps based on the Atlas UI framework only. For details on Atlas UI, see [Atlas UI](../../howto/front-end/atlas-ui).

Every page is *based on* a layout and a template:

* **Layout** – a frame you put your page in. Every page is based on a layout. For example, **Atlas_Default** or **PopupLayout** are types of layouts you can choose when creating a page. Layouts define a position and look of such UI elements as a page header and menu bars. 
* **Template** – a starting point for a new page. Every time you create a new page, you select a template depending on data you want to display on your page and the way you want to display it: a list, a dashboard, a form. Depending on your choice, a page template can have a number of predefined elements on it, such as lists with images, forms. For example, **Dashboard Action Tiles**, **List Default**, **Master Detail** are types of templates. 

*Look and structure* of a page is defined by the following elements:

* **Widgets** – single user-interface elements. For more information, see the [Widgets](#widgets) section and [Widgets](page-editor-widgets).
* **Building blocks** – pre-configured set of *widgets* that speeds up the process of building your page and styling it. For more information, see the [Building Blocks](#building-blocks) section. 

The diagram below explains function of layouts, templates, and widgets:

All elements described above (layouts, templates, widgets, and building blocks) are powered by Atlas UI. For more information on what Atlas UI is, see [Atlas UI](../../howto/front-end/atlas-ui).

2. Select an element you would like to add, drag and drop this element on a page. 

### 2.7 Viewing Elements On a Page

There are two ways to view an element and its [properties](#page-editor-properties):

* Clicking the element on a page itself
* Clicking the element in a breadcrumb (for more information, see the [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb) section)

The selected element is indicated with an blue border. Additionally, if the element is inside a data container (data view or a list view), it will be indicated with a data container icon:

{{% image_container width="400" %}}![](attachments/page-editor/input-widget-example.png)
{{% /image_container %}}

### 2.8 Deleting Elements from a Page

* Open the **Properties** tab of this element and this click **Delete** at the bottom of the tab

## 3 Breadcrumb {#breadcrumb}

A breadcrumb is displayed on every page in the left bottom corner of Studio.

The breadcrumb serves two functions:

* Shows a bottom-up layering of a selected item on a page. For example, when you select a button on a page, you will see that it is placed in a container, which is in a column.  Whereas, the column is in a row, and this row is placed in a layout grid on the page:

  ![](attachments/page-editor/breadcrumb.png)

* Allows you to select an element on the page and view its properties. To navigate to an element on a page and view element's properties, click this element in the breadcrumb.

## 4 Toolbox Tab

The **Toolbox** shows the tools that can be used on pages. 

This tab consists of the following:

* [Widgets](#widgets)
* [Building Blocks](#building-blocks)

### 4.1 Widgets {#widgets}

Widgets are single user-interface elements that can be configured. 

You can [quickly configure](page-editor-widgets#quick-config) most of the non-custom widgets when adding them on a page. For more information on how to configure widgets, see [Widgets](page-editor-widgets). 

You can update widgets in the [Widget Overview](settings-widget-overview). 

### 4.2 Building Blocks {#building-blocks}

Building blocks consist of pre-set widgets that allow you to build a page faster:  

![](attachments/page-editor/building-blocks.png)

Building blocks of Studio are divided into the following categories:

| Building Block | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Headers        | A header combines the functionality of a page title and a control bar for your page. Due to its compact design and versatility it is often used in mobile pages. |
| Lists          | Use these blocks when you need to display a list of data.    |
| Cards          | Cards contain diverse building blocks for different purposes. |
| Charts         | Use these building blocks if you want to present your data as a chart. |
| Forms          | Use these building blocks for a form to be filled out by users in your app. |
| List Controls  | Represent data as a control list and help you to sort and search items in the list. |
| Master Detail  | Use these building blocks to display the list of many items, but to show the details only for the selected element. |
| Breadcrumbs    | Use these building blocks when you want to show the current page location in your application. |
| Timeline       | Contains building blocks that show a list of events.         |
| Wizards        | Use these building blocks for inputting information step by step. |
| Notifications  | Contain building blocks used for different notifications.    |
| Alignments     | Use these building blocks to align elements.                 |

If you want to read documentation on a particular building block and to know more about how and when to use it, click the small icon in the top right corner of the building block.

Building blocks categories may differ because Atlas UI can be customized using Studio Pro.

## 5 Properties Tab {#page-editor-properties}

The **Properties** tab displays the properties of the currently selected element and can differ per element. 

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![](attachments/page-editor/properties.png)
{{% /image_container %}}

For example, if you click **Layout**—which is the layout that you choose when [creating a page](#creating-new-page)—in the breadcrumb, properties will display reference information on page-related actions that you can perform, such as changing the page title and customizing pages' look:
