## 2022

### July 11th, 2022

* When you drag and drop a parameter to the microflow editor working area, it gets a default name. This improvement speeds up the process of configuring a microflow. 

### June 30th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.15.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.15/#9150).
* We added new expressions – Subtract Date Functions Calls that allow you subtract a time period from a date and time and return the modified value. For example, to check if the due date was expired more than a week ago you can use the following expression: `$workflowContext/DueDate < subtractDays([%CurrentDateTime%], 7)`.
* We added `addQuarters` and `addQuartersUTC` functions to Add Date Function Calls.

### June 24th, 2022

#### Improvements

* We fixed the drag-and-drop issue in the workflow editor.
* We fixed an issue of not seeing custom widgets in the **Toolbox** on pages but seeing a message about the Marketplace being down.

### May 9th, 2022

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue with a horizontal scrollbar that appeared when you selected attributes in the Approval Request workflow wizard. For more information on the wizard, see [How to Configure a Workflow Using the Wizard in Studio](/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure-using-wizard/) in *Studio 9 How-tos*.

### April 29th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.13.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.13/#9130).

#### Improvements

* We extended the expression language with four new tokens to make it very easy to evaluate against yesterday or tomorrow.
* We changed the **Return Value** category of the **Call Microflow** activity in microflows and workflows to **Output** for more consistency. 
* We added new video tutorials on how to build an app to the **Help & Learning** to enable you to learn how to use Studio faster. 
* With workflows being re-enabled and made generally available in Studio for apps in Mendix version 9.12.1 or above, we updated the upgrading     process for existing apps: 
  * If your app has Mendix version 9.6 or above and does **not** yet have workflows, you can upgrade automatically in Studio to Mendix 9.12.1 or above and start using workflows.
  * If your app has Mendix version 9.5.1 or above and has workflows (which were in Beta) enabled, your app can only be upgraded manually by a team member using Studio Pro. For information on how to upgrade the app, see [Migrate Workflow Apps](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/workflow-beta-migration/) in *Studio Pro Guide*. 

### April 14th, 2022

#### New Features

* Workflows are now fully available in Studio: workflow functionality is not in Beta anymore, so you can use your apps with workflows in production now. For more information on workflows and how to create them, see [Workflows](/studio/workflows/). 
* We added the Approval Flow wizard when you create a workflow. If your use case falls under approval process, for example, approving vacation days for your team, you can use the wizard to create the app automatically: you define data type, and the wizard sets up the rest, including a workflow, relevant pages, and navigation. For more information, see [How to Configure a Workflow Using the Wizard in Studio](/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure-using-wizard/) in *Studio 9 How-tos*.

### March 29th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.12.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.12/#9120).

Open the **Properties** tab of the activity and click the **More** icon > **Disable** at the bottom of the tab. When you need to re-enable the activity back, you can always do so in its properties. For more information, see the [Disabling an Activity](/studio/microflows/#disable) section in *Microflows*.

This gives you a clear overview and helps keep your app up-to-date with the latest Mendix features, security, and bug fixes.
