## Submit A New Request

If you can't find the answer to a question on the Mendix Forum or in the Mendix Documentation, you can submit a request. The Support Portal will walk you through the ticket creation and asks for relevant information based on the type of request. Follow these steps to submit a request with Mendix Support:

3.  Fill in the fields for the issue type you selected.

There are certain fields that you always need to fill in. The most important one is the affected app. You can choose from every app you have access to. You access level is determined by your Project Role in the Developer Portal. There is always a default company account that you can use to submit general tickets. 

Other fields only appear for certain issues, like the example below.

If that does not work out, you can submit the request.

Urgency:

*   High: The operational functionality is severely disrupted.
*   Medium: The operational functionality is limited disrupted
*   Low: The operational functionality is hardly disrupted.

You can set the priority to:

*   Critical

The priority follows from the following matrix.
