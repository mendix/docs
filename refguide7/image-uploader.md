## General properties

### Maximum file size (MB)

With this property you can specify the maximum file size (in megabytes) of images that can be uploaded.

_Default value:_ 5

### Allowed extensions

You can specify the file extensions that are allowed to be uploaded. If no extensions are specified all file extensions are allowed. Separate multiple extensions by a semi-colon, e.g. `png;jpg`
