## 1 Introduction

The [Intelligent Document Service](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/118388) app service uses AI and OCR technologies to extract text and key value pairs from images of documents in bulk.

### 1.1 How Intelligent Document Service Works?

To use Intelligent Document Service, you need to first train a machine learning model and then publish the model. Once published, the model can automatically extract important data in your documents.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/document-model-training-diagram.png" alt="Document Model Training Diagram" >}}

#### 1.1.1 Training the Document Model

To train a model, first you need to upload sample documents. Then you need to mark the important fields for each sample document. After that, you should publish the model.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/training-steps.png" alt="Training Steps" >}}

How well a model is trained depends on the input you provide for the training. The quality of the training input relies on three factors:

* the number of the sample documents that you provide as input – the more sample documents you provide as input, the better the training results are

* the similarity in the structures of the sample documents – when all the sample documents have the same or similar document structure, you can get best training results

*  the accuracy of the marks on the locations of the important fields in the sample documents – you should mark the locations of the important fields accurately in the sample documents to achieve optimal training results, for example:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/invoice-marks.png" alt="" >}}

#### 1.1.2 Publishing the Model

After you upload the sample documents and mark the locations of the important fields in the sample documents, you can publish the model. During the publishing process, the model gets trained internally and the training project gets saved. After the publishing process is completed successfully, the model is published.

#### 1.1.3 Extracting Data

Once a model is published, you can download the JSON structure of this model, and then create the Import Mapping using this JSON structure. Then you can use the Import Mapping in an activity in a microflow to extract data from the documents that are fed to the activity. The documents that you feed to the activity should have the same or similar structure as the sample documents that were used to train the model. You can set up a microflow to store the extracted data as objects for other use.

### 1.2 Features

* Extract data from images ( in JPG, JPEG, BMP, and PNG formats) in bulk and map data to an entity
* Extract data from a single-page PDF document
* Train a model using sample images by marking specific areas in images
* Support [Mendix SSO](/appstore/modules/mendix-sso/)

### 1.3 Limitation

* Currently images used for the training of the model should be in JPG, JPEG, BMP, or PNG format.

### 1.4 Prerequisites

* This app service works best with Studio Pro 8 versions starting with [8.18.15](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.18/#81815) and 9 versions starting with [9.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.0/).
* For optimal recognition results, make sure that documents with small fonts have high resolutions:
    * If images are made using a scanner, it is recommended to use 300 dpi for texts in font size 10 pt or larger and 400-600 dpi for texts in font size 9 pt or smaller.
    * If images are taken using a digital camera, it is recommend to use at least a 5-megapixel sensor with auto focusing and flash disabling features, fit the page entirely within the camera frame, and distribute lighting evenly across the page to avoid any dark areas or shadows on the image.

## 4. Usage

To use the Intelligent Document Service, first [train a model](#document-model-training) using sample images, then create an [import mapping](#mapping-file) that defines how to map extracted data from images to an entity, and then include the [intelligent document activity](#extraction-activity) in a microflow. This microflow should be set up to accept your trained model and images, extract data from the images in bulk and then map the data to an entity using the import mapping that you created.

### 4.1 Training a Document Model {#document-model-training}

#### 4.1.1 Guidelines for Improving the Accuracy of Data Extraction {#guidelines}

You should use at least three to five sample images to train your model to reach the higher accuracy of data extraction. The more sample images that you use to train your model, the higher accuracy of data extraction you can achieve. However, all sample images that are used for one training must have a similar structure. 

 If a table in the documents for extraction can have different numbers of rows, then make sure that the table in each sample image also have different number of rows.

You should use the marker tool properly – this is key to extracting data in higher quality. The areas you mark determine where the document model will extract the data. Make sure that you mark the complete field area. Only in this way, will the document model read the complete field area and accurately extract a long value.

#### 4.1.2 Procedure

### 4.2 Creating an Import Mapping{#mapping-file}

You need to use an [import mapping](/refguide/mapping-documents/#import-mappings) to populate extracted data into an entity. If necessary, you can further process the entity with [event handlers](/refguide/event-handlers/).

1.  To create an import mapping, you need a JSON structure. Perform the following steps to generate the JSON structure:
    1. Log in to the [Document Model Training](#document-model-training) application with your Mendix account.
    2. Click **Environment** to show the **Existing Models** list.
    3. Select your trained model. Make sure that the **Status** of the model is **Published**. Note down the **Model Id**. You will need it when you [extract data with the trained model](#extraction-activity).
    4.  Click **...** in the **Actions** column of the published model and then click **Download JSON Structure**.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/ids-download-json-structure.png" >}}

        The **Generate JSON Structure** dialog box opens.
    
    5.  Drag one of the sample images which you used to train the document model or a single-page PDF document into the box where it says **Drag and drop your files here**. You can also click **Browse** and select the file.
    
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/sample-extraction-dialog-box.png" alt="Sample Extraction dialog box" >}}
    
    6.  Click **Download** to get the JSON structure.
    
        {{% alert color="info" %}}As this action actually exacts data from the input samples to generate the JSON structure, the usage is counted against the allocated quota for your provisioned instance.{{% /alert %}}
    
        {{% alert color="info" %}}You may get blank value(s) in the extracted response for some fields, as our intelligent component returns an empty field when it is not confident about the extraction result. To improve the accuracy of data extraction, see the [Guidelines for Improving the Accuracy of Data Extraction](#guidelines) section. {{% /alert %}}
    
2.  To add the JSON structure to your app, perform the following steps:
    1.  In the **App Explorer** or **Project Explorer**, right-click the module or the folder where you want to add the generated JSON structure.
    2.  From the pop-up menu, select **Add other** > [JSON structure](/refguide/json-structures/).

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/json-structure.png" alt="json-structure" >}}

    3. In the **Add JSON Structure** dialog box, enter a **Name** for the JSON structure and click **OK**. The **JSON Structure** dialog box opens.
    4. In the **JSON Snippet** box, add the content of the JSON structure that you have generated. The system converts the JSON snippet into a schema structure automatically. You will need this schema structure to create the import mapping.
    5. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.
3.  To create the import mapping, perform the following steps:
    1. In the **App Explorer** or **Project Explorer**, right-click the module or the folder where you want to add the import mapping.     
    2. From the pop-up menu, select **Add other** > **Import mapping**.
    3. In the **Add Import Mapping** dialog box, enter a **Name** for the import mapping and click **OK**. The **Select schema elements for import mapping** dialog box opens.    
    4.  For **Schema source**, select **JSON structure** and **Select** the JSON structure that you created.
    
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/schema-source-json-structure.png" alt="schema-source-json-structure" >}}
    5. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.

### 4.3 Extracting the Data with the Trained Document Model {#extraction-activity}

1.  In the **Toolbox**, drag the **Intelligent Document Service** activity from the **Document Data Capture Service** category into your microflow.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/intelligent-document-microflow.png" alt="intelligent-document-microflow" >}}

2.  Create a list of documents that inherits from `System.FileDocument`. Documents from where data are extracted should be passed as a list, as shown in the microflow above.

    {{% alert color="info" %}} The total size of the documents being passed for extraction should not exceed 20 MB. If you have multiple documents to extract data from, you can process them in smaller batches. {{% /alert %}}

    {{% alert color="info" %}}The number of documents passed as a list in the microflow and processed by the **Intelligent Document Service** activity will be counted against the allocated quota for your provisioned instance.{{% /alert %}}

3.  Double-click the **Intelligent Document Service** activity to open the dialog box.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/intelligent-document-service/intelligent-document-service-dialog-box.png" alt="Intelligent Document Service dialog box" >}}

4. For **Model Id**, click **Edit** to enter the **Model Id** of your model.
5. For **Document List**, click **Edit** to select the **Document List** which inherits from `System.FileDocument`.
6. For **Mapping**, **Select** the import mapping that you created to define how extracted data should be mapped into an entity.
7. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.

{{% alert color="info" %}} Optionally for further automation, add [event handlers](/refguide/event-handlers/) on the entity where you populate the extracted data. You can call your own microflow to process the extracted data when inserted into the entity. For example, you can modify, validate, and pass the data to next steps. By doing this, you can achieve full end-to-end automation.{{% /alert %}}
