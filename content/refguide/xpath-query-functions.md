The following XPath query aggregate functions are available:

* [avg](xpath-avg)
* [count](xpath-count)
* [id](xpath-id)
* [max](xpath-max)
* [min](xpath-min)
* [sum](xpath-sum)

These functions must contain full queries as their arguments. However, the *avg*, *max*, *min*, and *sum* functions must specify a column in the query to aggregate.
