## 1 Introduction

Several places in published REST services indicate that you can use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for rich text.

This is especially useful in case you want to include JSON example payload in your rest documentation. Just add three backticks, `json`, the JSON structure, and three backticks to close the code, as illustrated in this example:
