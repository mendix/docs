Start learning how the Mendix Metamodel works by reading [Understanding the Mendix Metamodel](understanding-the-metamodel).

Continue with [Projects (Metamodel)](projects-metamodel) to learn how the Mendix Metamodel handles projects in relation to modules and documents.

Next, move on to learning how a [Domain Model (Metamodel)](domain-model-metamodel)  works with all its components (attributes, access rules, etc.).

The [Pages (Metamodel)](pages-metamodel) page explains how pages, layouts, and page content are structured.

The [Microflows (Metamodel)](microflows-metamodel) page describes in detail how you can create and invoke microflows.
