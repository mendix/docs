## 1 Introduction

This document describes common properties that are shared by many elements in the microflow editor.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}
Not every element in a microflow or a nanoflow has all of these properties.
{{% /alert %}}

These are the common properties for microflows and nanoflows:

* [Caption](#caption)
* [Auto-generate caption](#auto-generate-caption)
* [Background color](#color)
* [Error handling type](#error-handling)

## 2 Caption {#caption}

The **Caption** describes what happens in this element. 

## 3 Auto-Generate Caption {#auto-generate-caption}

The **Auto-generate caption** property specifies whether the caption is automatically generated based on the type of activity.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | The caption of the activity is generated by Studio Pro. |
| No | You can edit the caption yourself in the **Caption** property. |

*Default value*: Yes

## 3 Background Color {#color}

In **Background color**, you can choose a background color for the activity. Colors do not influence execution; they are only used to quickly spot an element in a flow. For example, you can make activities with [error handlers](microflows#errorhandlers) red so you can easily identify them.

## 4 Error Handling Type {#error-handling}

In **Error handling type**, you can choose the type of error handling for the activity. For details on avaliable options and their effects, refer see the [Error Handlers](microflows#errorhandlers) section in *Microflows*.
