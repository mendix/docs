## 3 Custom Domain

In this tab you can manage your custom domain certificates on an application level.

When your Mendix app needs to be accessible via your own URL (for example, `https://myapp.mycompany.com/`), you have to provide a custom domain certificate (an SSL/TLS certificate) so that we can keep serving your Mendix app via a secure connection.

There is also a section with an overview of linked custom domains.

For more information, see [How to Configure Custom Domains](/developerportal/howto/custom-domains).

## 4 Access Restriction Profiles

In this tab you can manage custom access restriction profiles. These profiles can combine IP range filters and client certificate verification. Access restriction profiles can be applied to path-based access restrictions in specific environments of the application.
