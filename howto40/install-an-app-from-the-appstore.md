 **Where is my App?**

Your App is now stored in your project. There are different types of applications, which are sent to different places in your project. The next paragraphs will explain where widgets, themes and modules are placed after downloading.

 **Where is my widget?**

A widget will be stored in the 'MyProject/widgets' folder. In the Modeler it can be found in the bottom of the Toolbox and in the toolbar at the top of every form.
