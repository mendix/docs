In this how-to you will build your first application and deploy it to the cloud. Before you continue with this how-to, make sure that you are logged in to Mendix. You can log in at [http://www.mendix.com/](http://www.mendix.com/). If you do not have an account, you can sign up here: [http://www.mendix.com/try-now/](http://www.mendix.com/try-now/).

**After this how-to you will know:**

*   How to create an App in Mendix.
*   How to deploy an App with Mendix.

## 1\. Preparation

Before starting this how-to, please make sure you have completed the following steps:

*   Create an account with Mendix [here](http://www.mendix.com/try-now/).
*   Download and install the Mendix Business Modeler [here](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/modelers).

## 2\. Create a collaboration project

With Mendix you can manage requirements, build applications under version control and deploy them into the cloud. Normally you would use multiple different environments for this, but Mendix is truly your one-stop-shop for enterprise application development. To manage your applications from idea to deployment we use projects. In this step you'll learn how to create a project yourself.

1.  Go to [http://home.mendix.com/](http://home.mendix.com/).
2.  Click on **CREATE NEW APP**.
