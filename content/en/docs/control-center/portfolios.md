## 1 Introduction

The **Portfolios** page offers governance features for [portfolio management](/developerportal/portfolio-management/) in your company. You can have an overview of all portfolios in your company, manage portfolio access, delete portfolios, reject or approve requests for changes of portfolio privacy settings. 

The **Portfolios** page contains three tabs: [All Portfolios](#all-portfolios), [Alerts](#alerts), and [Privacy Requests](#privacy-requests).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
As a Mendix Admin, you cannot directly see the content of a portfolio. You need to have [portfolio access](#access-management) for this. You can give yourself portfolio access if needed.

## 2 All Portfolios {#all-portfolios}

The **All Portfolios** tab lists all portfolios in your company. Here you can [manage portfolio access](#access-management) and [delete portfolios](#delete-portfolio). In the search box, you can search for a portfolio by its name.

In the list, you can see the following items:

* **Portfolio Name** – This is the name of the portfolio. Clicking the name opens a pop-up window that shows the general information of the portfolio, such as the company name, privacy settings of the portfolio, number of active members (deactivated users are not counted), and a list of the Portfolio Managers.

    * **Private** – A private portfolio is not discoverable in the **Company Portfolios** section of the [Portfolio Landscape Overview](/developerportal/portfolio-management/#portfolio-landscape) page in the Portfolio Management app. People who want to access a private portfolio need an invitation.
    * **Restricted** – A restricted portfolio is discoverable in the **Company Portfolios** section of the [Portfolio Landscape Overview](/developerportal/portfolio-management/#portfolio-landscape) page in the Portfolio Management app. People who want to access a restricted portfolio need an invitation.

* **Created** – This shows the date on which the portfolio was created.

* **Last Modified** – This shows the date on which the portfolio was last modified.

* Ellipsis (**...**) – Clicking the button opens a menu with the following items:

    * **Access management** – Selecting this brings you to the [Access Management](#access-management) page.

    * **Delete** – Selecting this allows you to [delete the portfolio](#delete-portfolio) permanently together with all the data in the portfolio.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

If a portfolio has an alert icon (**⚠**), that means it no longer has a Portfolio Manager. You can assign new Portfolio Managers to the portfolio or delete the portfolio. All the portfolios that no longer have a Portfolio Manager are also listed on the [Alerts](#alerts) tab.

After you click the ellipsis button (**...**) in the list on the [All Portfolios](#all-portfolios) tab or the [Alerts](#alerts) tab, you can choose **Access Management** to open the **Access Management** page. The Access Management page contains two tabs: the **Members** tab and the **Pending Invites** tab.

#### 2.1.1 Members {#members}

The **Members** tab shows all users who have access to the portfolio. You can search for a user in the search box by the user name, email, company, or role.

The **Add Users** button on the upper-right corner allows you to invite new users to the portfolio using their email addresses.

The **Remove Deactivated Users** button is available when there are deactivated members in the portfolio. Clicking the button allows you to remove all deactivated users from this portfolio.

#### 2.1.2 Pending Invites {#pending-invites}

When a Portfolio Manager invites a user outside the company to join the portfolio, the user gets an invite via email. The user must first accept the invite, then they can access this portfolio. Until the user accepts or rejects the invite, the invite appears on the **Pending Invites** tab. After they accept the invitation, they will appear on the **Members** tab.

After you click the ellipsis button (**...**) in the list on the [All Portfolios](#all-portfolios) tab or the [Alerts](#alerts) tab, you can choose **Delete** to delete the portfolio.

## 4 Privacy Requests {#privacy-requests}

On the **Privacy Requests** tab, you can decide whether a Mendix Admin needs to approve the creation of a restricted portfolio or any change of privacy settings of an existing portfolio. You can use the toggle on the tab to turn it on or off. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/portfolios/admin-curation-toggle.png" alt="Mendix Admins must approve changes to portfolio privacy settings" >}}

The toggle is turned off by default. If the toggle is turned on, as a Mendix Admin, you automatically get a [notification](/developerportal/global-navigation/#notifications) whenever someone creates a restricted portfolio or changes the privacy settings of an existing portfolio. 

On the **Privacy Requests** tab, you can view all the pending requests. You can approve or reject a request here. Every request contains the following items:

* **Portfolio Name** – This shows the name of the portfolio.
* **Requested By** – This shows the name of the user who made the request.
* **From** – This shows the current privacy settings.
* **To** – This shows the new privacy settings that are being requested.
* **Date** – This shows the date on which the request was made.
* **Reject** – Clicking this rejects the request. When you reject a request, optionally you can fill in a reason to inform the requester.
* **Approve** – Clicking this approves the request.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
After a request is either rejected or approved, a notification is sent to the requester. If the Mendix Admin fills in the reason for the rejection, the reason is also shown to the requester.
