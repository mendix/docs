An end event defines the location where the microflow will stop. If the return type of the microflow is not `Nothing` a return value should be specified.

If you want to stop your microflow after an activity, you link the activity, using a sequence flow with a stop event. In this case the microflow is called from another microflow that expects the buyer to be returned.
