## Introduction

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
For input elements, it is recommended to use the [label property](/refguide/text-box/) to describe the purpose of widgets to end-users.

You can also use the [text widget](/refguide/text/) as it provides more features, for example, you can add parameters, and it generates semantically correct HTML.
