This activity can only be used in microflows.

## 1 Introduction

A **Retrieve workflows** activity can be used to retrieve a list of **System.Workflow** objects.

It needs a [workflow context object](/refguide/workflow-parameters/#entity) as its input. The provided workflow context object here can be associated with one or several workflow instances. A Runtime error occurs if the [WorkflowContext parameter](/refguide/workflow-parameters/) contains no object.

You can use this activity to check if the workflow context object is already used in a workflow, and if so, which workflows are used to process the workflow context object.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
All the workflow objects this activity returns are of type **System.Workflow**, but they can be related to different workflow definitions that are of type [System.WorkflowDefinition](/refguide/workflow-engine/#definition).
