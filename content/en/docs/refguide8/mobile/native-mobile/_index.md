## 1 Introduction

As of Mendix 8, it is possible to build fully native mobile apps. Native mobile apps differ from hybrid apps in that they do not render inside a web view. Instead, they use native UI elements. This enables fast performance, smooth animations, swipe gestures, and improved access to all native device capabilities.
