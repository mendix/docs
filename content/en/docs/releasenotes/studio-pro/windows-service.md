## 4.6

### 4.6.1 {#4_6_1}

**Release date: February 8th, 2021**

* <a name="46ki"></a>We now find a correct AdoptOpenJDK version for [Studio Pro 8](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.0/) and above if that is not configured yet.
* We changed the `Update-MxApp` cmdlet so that it no longer applies file access rights. Normally, you only need to do this once, so the Mendix Service Console will do this when you add a new app. If you still want this on an existing app, you can update the app manually in the Service Console and use the check box on the **Update App** form to apply the user rights again. For more information, see the release note about this check box for version [4.5.1](#451) below. (Ticket 67514)
* We now allow you to not configure the main location of the files when starting the Mendix Service Console for the first time. The application will be closed in that case.
* We fixed an issue where errors during the download or extraction of the server distribution file were not shown.
* We fixed an issue with the download of the server distribution file that started to fail recently, because the currently used .NET Framework version does not support the server TLS version by default.
* We made the progress bar of the extraction process of the server distribution file more realistic.
* We now check the Java version when you start an app on Studio Pro 8 or higher.

### 4.6.0 {#4_6}

**Release date: August 8th, 2019**

* We added support for [Studio Pro 8](/releasenotes/studio-pro/8.0/).
* We added the option to download the applicable server distribution on the form where you add or update an app.
* The default location in the **Browse** window is now selected when uploading or when a temporary files path is not set.
* We updated the [Newtonsoft Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library from 5.0.3 to 12.0.2.
* We updated the [DotNetZip](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=DotNetZip) library from version 1.11.0 to 1.13.3.
* We replaced an old version of the [Active Directory Common Dialogs .NET](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=adui) library with [Tulpep.ActiveDirectoryObjectPicker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tulpep.ActiveDirectoryObjectPicker/) 2.3.133.
* Known issue: If an Oracle Java 8 installation is available, this version will be selected by default for Mendix 8 apps. Please make sure you select JRE or JDK 11 from Oracle or OpenJDK (AdoptOpenJDK).
   * Fixed in [4.6.1](#46ki).

* We now show more information during the update process of an app.
* We updated the DotNetZip library from version 1.10.1 to 1.11.0. This library is used for making backups and extracting deployment archives.
* We removed our dependency on the Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks library.
* We improved the check on whether the correct Mendix Server version is available.

* We fixed the exception that occurred when showing active server actions. (Ticket 41924, 44180)
* We added DB2 and MariaDB as database types. They will only be useful when supported by the server version of the app.
* We added more clear database synchronization information when migrating from one database to another.
* We simplified the update app and update server dialog forms.
* We updated DotNetZip library from version 1.9.1.8 to 1.10.1. This library is used for making backups and extracting deployment archives.

## 4.3

**Release date: March 4th, 2016**

* Now file access rights are automatically added for the configured user so that all necessary files can be accessed to run the app (ticket 101922).
* Removed the list of installed Mendix server versions from the Update app form.
* Added MySQL as new database type, which is supported since Mendix 5.12.

### 4.2.0

**Release date: January 16th, 2014**

## 4.0

**Release date: December 12th, 2012**

Mendix Service Console 4 manages all your Mendix 3 and 4 apps within one application. The left bar shows all the apps on your server. When you click an app, you can manage that app on the panel at the right side. You can show logging output of all your apps in separate windows.
Installation

Execute the new installer to install the Mendix Service Console on your system. Do not install it in the locations you earlier extract the Mendix Service Console ZIP file to. Starting with this version apps no longer have their own service console; this new Mendix Service Console manages all your apps!
Import of old apps

Import all your old apps one by one. All project, log and backup files will remain in the same old locations. Only the settings will be saved to a new location and you have to add Mendix distributions again. Only do a reinstall of the service when the app runs successfully with a normal start. After a reinstall of the service (and if the service starts correctly), the old Mendix Service Console for that app can be removed.
Licensing changes

Now each app has its own license, even if it runs under the same user account as another app. It is possible to import old apps with their license key, but only for the first app per user with a license.

* Added the possibility to manage all Mendix 3 and 4 apps into one instance of the Mendix Service Console. The Mendix Service Console manages the default location of the files of all apps and servers.
* Added an installer to install one Mendix Service Console per machine.
* Ticket 9960, 11133: Now each app has its own license on one machine.
* Added the possibility to add an existing Mendix 3 or 4 app with its license. (Click Add app, Import old app...)

* Added a wizard to add and configure a new app.
* Added a log line with progress bar while synchronizing the app with the database. The currently running synchronization SQL command can be viewed by double clicking the log line.
* Now the old log lines will not be removed anymore when an application has been stopped and started again. The new log session will be marked by a new gray log line.
* Now only up to 1000 log lines will be shown. Any more log lines will be removed, starting with the oldest.
* Now an app will not be stopped automatically anymore if the Mendix Service Console has been closed and the app was started but not as Windows service. When the Mendix Service Console is started again and the app is clicked, it will reconnect to the running app.
*  Ticket 12002: Now 'lost' running Mendix services can be connected and stopped by the console. This case occurs when the Windows service has been stopped unexpectedly but the Java process of the app still runs.
* Now the symbolic link to the runtime's mxclientsystem folder will always be created and updated when an app is added or updated. The checkbox has been removed.
* Changed the position of the buttons and their texts to open the app configuration forms.
* Moved settings for project, log and backup path, custom Mendix settings, environment and Jetty settings to a new Advanced Settings form, reachable via Configuration, Advanced...
* Now the two Jetty options can be configured by two textboxes instead of a list with custom keys and values.
* New apps will have an unique name, based on the default name 'NewApp'.
* For new apps, the Mendix Service Console searches the system for a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) at many more locations to be able to set this as default.
* Now the log, uploaded files and temp folders will be created automatically on startup if they don't exist and if they have their default paths.
* Now the backup folder will be created automatically when creating a backup, if it doesn't exist and if it has its default path.
* Now the runtime and admin HTTP port numbers are checked for uniqueness; otherwise a message will be shown. New apps will get unique numbers.

* Added possibility to define the publicness of the runtime and admin server HTTP ports (listening on localhost, public or a comma-separated list of IP addresses), only for Mendix versions 4.3 and higher.
* Changed database type choice text 'Oracle 10.2 and later' to 'Oracle 11.2 and later'.
* Reordered the database types alphabetically.
* Set SQL Server as default database type.
* Increased the height of the form to set the log levels.
* Now toolbar buttons responds to clicks if the form does not have the focus.

* Now a more user friendly error message will be shown with a help button on application start if the given (domain) user does not have rights to logon locally (native error 1385: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.)
* Now the service cannot be uninstalled when the service is running.
* Small user interface changes.

Mendix chooses the right version to start the project. The existing Mendix server version from pre-2.1 Mendix Windows Service applications will be kept when using this 2.1 version, but when you installs a new Mendix server version, that version will be used if suitable for the project.
* Now the application is always started under the specific service user account to simulate the same user environment as when it is started as service. A service user account must be given before a project can be run.
