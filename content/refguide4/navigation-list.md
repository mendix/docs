## General

### Action

Action defines what action is performed when a navigation list item is 'clicked'. This can either be opening a form or calling a microflow. For opening a form see [Opening Forms](opening-forms) and for calling a microflow see [Starting Microflows](starting-microflows). Microflows attached to a navigation list item have no Confirmation or Advanced microflow settings.
