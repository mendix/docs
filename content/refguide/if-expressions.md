## 1 Introduction

If expressions can be used to define conditional actions in expressions. The correct syntax is the following:

if _`<condition>`_ then _`<a value>`_ else _`<other value>`_

## 2 Example

Using the following statement as the expression of a Change variable activity for a string value:

```java
if 7 > 6 then "correct" else "incorrect"
```

will set the value of the variable to `correct`.
