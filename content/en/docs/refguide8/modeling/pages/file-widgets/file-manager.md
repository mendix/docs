## 1 Introduction

A file manager is used to upload and/or download files.

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/modeling/pages/file-widgets/file-manager/file-manager.png" alt="File Manager" >}}

It must be placed inside a data view connected to the entity System.FileDocument or a specialization thereof.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When uploading a file through the file manager, the FileDocument object will be committed immediately.

### 2.1 Common Section {#common}

### 2.2 Design Properties Section {#design-properties}

{{% snippet file="/static/_includes/refguide8/design-section-link.md" %}} 

### 2.3 Editability Section {#editability}

{{% snippet file="/static/_includes/refguide8/editability-section-link.md" %}}

### 2.4 General Section {#general}

#### 2.4.1 Type

The **Type** property indicates how the end-user will be able to use the file manager.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Upload | The file manager can only be used to upload a file. |
| Download | The file manager can only be used to download a file. |
| Both *(default)*  | The file manager can be used to both upload and download a file. |

#### 2.4.2 Max File Size (MB)

**Max file size (MB)** determines the maximum size of files (in megabytes) that can be uploaded.

Default: *5*

#### 2.4.3 Allowed Extensions

You can specify file extensions that users are allowed to upload. If no extension is specified, all file extensions are allowed. Separate multiple extensions by a semi-colon, for example, `txt;doc`

If a file with an extension that is not allowed is selected, a [system text](/refguide8/system-texts/) for **File manager/image viewer** > **Error: incorrect file extension** will be shown below the file manager.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The feature to allow extensions is not meant as a security feature, as the file manager widget does not check the contents of a file to see if they match the provided extension. For more information, see the [Scanning Uploaded Files for Malicious Content](/howto8/security/best-practices-security/#scanning-for-malicious-content) section of *How to Implement Best Practices for App Security*.
