## 1 Introduction

To go directly to the desired element of your app in the Developer Portal, you can use deep links.

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* Find the App ID, Story ID, and Feedback Item Number for your app
* Create deep links for your app, story, and feedback item

## 2 Getting the AppID, storyID, and feedbackItemNr {#id}

To create a deep link, you need the app ID, story ID, or feedback item number or the desired element in the Developer Portal:

* For the app ID, select **Collaborate** > **General Settings** – you will find the ID at the bottom of the page:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/manage-deeplinks/app-id.png" width="500px" alt="App ID on General Settings page" >}}

* For the story ID, select **Collaborate** > **Stories** – then click the story title to show the details, the ID is below the story title:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/manage-deeplinks/story-id.png" width="500px" alt="Story ID on Stories page" >}}

* For the feedback item number, select **Collaborate** > **Feedback** – the number is next to the feedback item title:

## 3 Creating a Developer Portal Deep Link

If you want to provide links directly to a specific element in your app in the Developer Portal, follow these steps:

1. Paste the URL to the Developer in your browser's address bar (as in, `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/` or `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/`).
2. Paste the desired App ID, Environment ID, Story ID, or Feedback Item Number after the final slash.

The following deep links can be used:

* Specific app: `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/project/<appID>`
* App settings: `https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/link/settings/<appID>`
