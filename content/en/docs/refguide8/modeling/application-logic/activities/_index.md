## 1 Introduction

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow.

There are different types of activity, and these are grouped together in the Studio Pro toolbox. All the activities are listed below, follow the links for more information.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most activities can be used in both microflows and nanoflows. However, some can only be used in one of these types of flow, or the behavior may differ between microflows and nanoflows. Follow the links for more information.

## 2 Object Activities

Object activities can be used to create and manipulate objects. The [domain model](/refguide8/domain-model/) defines the object types ([entities](/refguide8/entities/)) that can be used.

| Graphic | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/modeling/application-logic/activities/cast-object.png" alt="cast object" link="/refguide8/cast-object/" >}} | [Cast object](/refguide8/cast-object/) *(microflows only)* | In combination with an [object type decision](/refguide8/object-type-decision/) allows you to use the specialized members of the object. For more information on the specialized members of an object, see [Entities](/refguide8/entities/). |
| {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/modeling/application-logic/activities/change-object.png" alt="change object" link="/refguide8/change-object/" >}} | [Change object](/refguide8/change-object/) |Allows you to change the members of an object. This can be done with or without committing, and with or without events. |

Furthermore, this activity can also get one or more objects directly from a database. |
| {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/modeling/application-logic/activities/rollback.png" alt="rollback object" link="/refguide8/rollback-object/" >}} | [Rollback object](/refguide8/rollback-object/) | Rolls uncommitted changes back that were made to an object in the part of the microflow preceding the activity. Furthermore, it deletes objects that have been created but have never been committed. |

## 3 List Activities

List activities can be used to create and manipulate lists of objects.
