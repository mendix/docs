## 1 Introduction

In the Mendix Cloud Professional and Enterprise plans you can configure a weekly time range (*Maintenance Window*) when system maintenance can occur. Whenever Mendix has planned operations, these will be executed within your preferred time window. Naturally, we will always inform you upfront on any upcoming maintenance operations in accordance with your SLA.

When a maintenance operation is planned, it will show up under **Planned Maintenance**. By default it will be planned in your preferred maintenance window. You can override the maintenance window of a specific maintenance operation by clicking **Reschedule**.
