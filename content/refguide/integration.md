## 1 Introduction

Integration with other applications (other than Mendix) can be done using REST or SOAP/Web Services. Mendix can import and export data from XML and JSON.

Integration between Mendix applications is done best with REST services (for details, see [Published REST Service](published-rest-services) and [Call REST Service](call-rest-action)). Some of the terms used most often are explained below.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
For a [call REST service](call-rest-action) activity and JSON support in [mapping documents](mapping-documents), see [Consumed REST Services](consumed-rest-services).
{{% /alert %}}{{% alert type="info" %}}
For a [call web service](call-web-service-action) activity and support for SOAP web services/XML, see [Consumed Web Services](consumed-web-services).
{{% /alert %}}
