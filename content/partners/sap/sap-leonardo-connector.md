An object of entity type *LeonardoMachineLearning.SimilarityScoringRequest*, or an entity which is based on the *LeonardoMachineLearning.SimilarityScoringRequest* entity.

|Attribute|Description|
|---|---|
|numSimilarVectors|The number of scores to return for each vector in the comparison|
|VectorSets|A string, in JSON format, containing the vectors to be compared|

For each vector in *VectorSets*, ScoreSimilarity will return the best *numSimilarVectors* comparisons.

**VectorSets** must be a string in JSON format which, in the simplest case, contains an array (called *0*) of vectors. Each vector contains an identifier and an array of values. See the example, below: [example](#scoresimilarity-example). It is also possible to compare two sets of vectors. More information is in the API documentation here: [Inference Service For Similarity Scoring](https://api.sap.com/api/similarity_scoring_api/resource).

*Limitations*

The vectors to be scored must be provided as a string in JSON format. The action does not accept files as input.

**Output**

The **ScoreSimilarity** action returns an object of entity type *LeonardoMachineLearning.SimilarityScoringResponse*.

![ScoreSimilarity domain model](attachments/sap-leonardo-connector/score-similarity-output.png)

|Entity/Attribute|Leonardo Equivalent|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**SimilarityScoringResponse**||One object which is the parent for the scores|
|**SimilarVectorsScore**|similarVectors|One object per comparison|
|FirstVectorId|id|The id of the vector being compared|
|SecondVectorId|id|The id of the vector which is in the top *numSimilarVectors* matches with *FirstVectorId*|
|Score||A score between -1 and 1 indicating how similar the vectors are|

<a name="scoresimilarity-example"></a>**Example**

You have three vectors, *v0*, *v1*, and *v2*, containing the following values: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0], and [1.0, 2.1, 3.1, 4.0]. In this case the JSON needs to be constructed as shown in the example, below.

```json
 {
 	"0": [{
 		"id": "v0",
 		"vector": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
 	}, {
 		"id": "v1",
 		"vector": [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
 	}, {
 		"id": "v2",
 		"vector": [1.0, 2.1, 3.1, 4.0]
 	}]
 }
```

If *numSimilarVectors* is set to *1* then the action will return just the best similarity score for each vector, and the id of the vector which is most similar.

|Vector|Most Similar to|Score|
|---|---|---|
|v0|v2|0.9998|
|v1|v2|0.9705|
|v2|v0|0.9998|
