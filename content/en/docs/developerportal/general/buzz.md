## 1 Buzz Locations

Located in the Developer Portal, Buzz lets you see Mendix app activity in your company as well as collaborate and share ideas with your team. There are two types of **Buzz** pages: Company Buzz and App Buzz.

## 2 Company Buzz {#company-buzz}

The **Company Buzz** is accessible via the top bar in the Developer Portal:

The drop-down menu for the content you see in the Company Buzz is set to **All Channels** by default, which shows Buzz activity for all the apps for which you are a team member *plus* all Buzz activity for your company. In the menu, you can choose to see only Buzz for your company or for a specific app for which you are a team member. 

Clicking an app name in **Recent Apps** will take you to the [App Buzz](#app-buzz) for that app, described below.

## 3 App Buzz {#app-buzz}

App **Buzz** is for a specific app:

You can see the size of your **Team** and your team members on the right side of the page. Click the **+** icon to invite new members to your team directly (please note that we show no more than 25 team members at a time). Click **Show all** to go to the [Team](/developerportal/general/team/) page for the app.

## 4 Communicating on Buzz

The easiest way to communicate with others in your company and on your team is by leaving comments in Buzz. In the **Update status** box, add a comment and click **Share**. You can also attach an image or a document via **Add**.

Once you have posted a comment, you can click **Edit** to **Update Message** or **Delete**. You can also **Reply in Thread** to comments left by colleagues.

On  **Company Buzz**, both Company Buzz and App Buzz communication can be seen by all users in your company via the **All Channels** filter or the company filter.
