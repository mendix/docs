The simple menu bar widget shows a configured menu in the form of a horizontal or vertical bar with images and captions. Items cannot have subitems; the menu structure can only have one level. The [menu items](/refguide7/menu-item/) points to either the page or the microflow that will opened or started when the item is clicked.
