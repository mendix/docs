## 1 Introduction

When you manage projects in a flow-based manner, only looking at each project's return on investment theoretically does not produce the best economic benefit. Instead, sequencing projects based on their priorities and updating their priorities continuously can bring you the best result.

The [Portfolio Management](/developerportal/portfolio-management/) tool supports two prioritization models, WSJF and RICE. These two prioritization models can be used to prioritize your projects in a flow-based environment. WSJF and RICE are based on different components. You can pick the prioritization model that is most suitable for your project portfolio management.

## 2 WSJF {#wsjf}

The weighted shortest job first (WSJF) score is calculated as the cost of delay (CoD) divided by the job size of a project. The CoD is the sum of the project's business value, time criticality, and risk reduction. If a project can deliver the most CoD with the smallest job size, it has the highest WSJF score, and provides the best change of return.

### 2.1 Calculating CoD

You can calculate the CoD by adding up the following three primary components:

* **Business Value**– This indicates how much business value this project will generate. For example, if the project can generate great revenue to your business or lead to a potential high penalty or other negative effects if it gets delayed, it has high business value. You define the business value based on a relative estimation instead of using actual monetary values. In the Portfolio Management app, you can select **Highest**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**, or **Lowest** to rate the business value of a project.
* **Time Criticality** – This indicates how time-critical this project is. For example, if a project's business value decreases sharply over time or has a fixed deadline, it is very time-critical. In the Portfolio Management app, you can select **Highest**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**, or **Lowest** to rate the time criticality of a project. The score should still be a relative estimation, instead of an absolute estimation.
* **Risk Reduction** – This indicates how much this project will help mitigate or reduce future risks. For example, moving a project to the cloud might not generate direct revenue, but it will prevent data loss risk. In the Portfolio Management app, you can select **Highest**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**, or **Lowest** to rate the risk reduction of a project.

### 2.2 Calculating Job Size

The job size of a project is the amount of effort that a project requires. In the Portfolio Management tool, the job size of a project is rated by five levels: **XL**, **L**, **M**, **S**, or **XS**. You should rate the job size of a project by comparing it with other projects. For example, you can set the project with the smallest job size to **XS**, and then set the other projects relative to that.

If the job size of a project is too big, we recommend you to split it into multiple smaller projects.

## 3 RICE {#rice}

You get the reach impact confident effort (RICE) score of a project by multiplying the Reach, Impact, and Confidence estimates and then dividing the product by the Effort estimate. A project with a higher RICE score has a better chance of return.

* **Reach** – This is the estimated number of relevant users that the project may affect within a time period. You can define by yourself who the users are and how the reach is defined. You must enter an integer for the Reach value.
* **Impact** – This is the estimated amount of impact that the project may have on individual users. When you score the impact of a project, you can break down the impact into various factors, and use a combined weighted score that combines all these factors. You can set it to **Massive**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**, or **Minimal** in the Portfolio Management app.
* **Confidence** – This indicates how confident you are about your Impact and Reach estimates. For example, if your estimates for one project are mostly based on a gut feeling, while your estimates for another project are well backed up by user research and experimentation, the Confidence score for the first project should be lower than the second one. In the Portfolio Management app, you can set the confidence for a project to **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**. If your confidence for a project is low, you can reconsider if the project is as good as it seems.
* **Effort** – This is the estimated total amount of time that the project will require from all members of your team: product, design, and development. This unit of this factor is persons per week or persons per month. For example, if one project requires ten persons to work on it for three weeks, and another project requires five persons to work on it for six weeks, the effort for these two project is the same. You must enter an integer for the Effort score.
