## 1 Introduction

After you have installed the Mendix software on your on-premises server and have deployed your first app (for details, see [Deploying Mendix on Microsoft Windows](deploy-mendix-on-microsoft-windows)), it is time to activate your license. This how-to will guide you through this process.  

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Activate a Mendix license on a Microsoft Windows server

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* To activate a Mendix instance on-premises you need an on-premises license (call your Customer Success Manager for more information)
* Install Mendix on your Microsoft Windows server (for more information, see [Deploying Mendix on Microsoft Windows](deploy-mendix-on-microsoft-windows))
* Be registered as the technical contact for the license
    * This is usually done in the license request process
    * If you are not the technical contact, ask him or her to follow this how-to to activate the license
* Have your MxID and password ready
* Have login access and access to the Mendix Service Console on the server
