### Placeholder Text

<div class="alert alert-info">

Available only for attributes of the date and time type.

</div>

The placeholder text is shown if the search input is empty. It can be used to give the end-user a hint as to the expected format. Note: placeholder texts will not work if a native date picker is available (for example, on iOS and Android versions 4.0 and above).
