## 1 App Store Content Support {#category}

Support for App Store content is determined by the content support category and the service level agreement (SLA) the user possesses. We distinguish the following content support categories:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Platform support | Mendix supports all the content in this category when you are equipped with an SLA (**Platform**, **Gold**, or **Platinum**) with Mendix. Content in this category is proactively incorporated into Mendix R&D test cycles as part of our platform release management. Please note that this category replaces the former **Extended** category, which has been deprecated. |
| Deprecated | The content in this category is considered end-of-life and will be dropped to the **Community support** status in the next major release of Mendix. Content is provided as-is by Mendix R&D, and support depends on the severity of the reported issue and the effort required to resolve it. |
| Community support | Content is provided as-is by members of the Mendix community, and support depends on the availability and effort of the owner. | 

## 2 Support Category & Feedback Process

We are always curious about and grateful for your feedback. The way you communicate your feedback to us depends on the support category of the content.

### 2.1 Platform Support Category

The applicable level of service for Mendix-supported App Store content is equal to the Mendix SLA you have acquired. In other words, the same SLA conditions apply to support on App Store content.

This means that equal response and resolve times are applicable, and the standard support process using the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) has to be followed.

### 2.2 Deprecated Support Category

We will move Platform-supported content into this category when we consider the content end-of-life. We factor in popularity, the availability of improved alternative(s), and industry standards when deciding on this.

Support for content in this category is decided by Mendix on a case-by-case basis. You can still follow the standard support process using the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com). However, the Mendix SLA no longer applies. 

### 2.3 Community Support Category {#community-category}

Support on content in this category is up to the user or organization providing the content. We recommend contacting the owner of the content in case of questions or issues via the following methods:

* Open an an issue on the GitHub repository associated with the content (for details on GitHub issues, see [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/))
* Contact the owner of the content via the contact details available on the App Store component's detail pages
* Ask a question son the [Mendix Forum](https://mxforum.mendix.com/)
* Contribute 

The level of support depends on the availability and effort of the developer and/or the Mendix community.
