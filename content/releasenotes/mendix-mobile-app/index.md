## 4.4.1 (iOS only)

**Release date: October 2nd, 2017**

### Bug fixes

* We fixed support for iOS 11: loading a Mendix hybrid app (for example, by using the QR scanner or from the **Apps** page) caused the Mendix mobile app to crash. This issue has been resolved.

## 4.4.0

**Release date: July 21st, 2017**

### New functionality

* You'll now see a few introductory slides when you use the app for the first time.
* The **Apps** page now contains an overview of recently opened hybrid apps.

### Improvements

* The sidebar closes automatically when you press one of the menu items.
* We've increased the touch area of back buttons so that they're easier to press.

## 4.3.0

**Release date: July 10th, 2017**

### New functionality

We have added two new features to accelerate your app delivery projects:
