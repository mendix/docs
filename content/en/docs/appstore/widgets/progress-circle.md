## 1 Introduction

The [Progress Circle](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/47783/) widget displays a progress in a circle.

The widget does the following:

* Displays a progress percentage in the form of a circle based on a configurable range
* Offers brand styling for the circle color through the **Appearance** design properties

## 2 Usage

The Progress Circle widget requires three values: a **Minimum value** and **Maximum value** to describe the full range of progress as well as a **Current value** to indicate the progression on that range. 

These values can be provided in three different ways: as a **Static** integer value, a **Dynamic** integer value, or an **Expression**. An On Click Action can be set onto the progress circle label to trigger custom logic during click interactions.

### 2.1 Label

Configuring the label on the progress circle can be done on the **Progress Label** tab and has the following options:

* Whether to show a label or not
* The type of the label:
	* **Text**: a custom text
	* **Percentage**: the **Current value** converted onto the configured range as a percentage. 
	* **Custom**: a custom widget

### 2.2 Styling

Under the **Appearance** tab, the following styling properties can be adjusted for the progress circle:

* Bar and background color based on brand styling
* Size (small, medium, and large)

## 3 Widgets Below Version 2.0.0

Features:

* Show percentage based on the progress value and maximum progress value
* Animate on load and on update
* Open a page or run a microflow on click
* Show the progress circle with different colors

Place the widget in the context of an object that has attributes for **Value attribute** and **Maximum value attribute**:

* If **Value attribute** is not set, **Value static** will be used to calculate the progress
* If **Maximum value attribute** is not set, the maximum value defaults to **Maximum value static**
