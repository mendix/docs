## 1 Introduction 

On pages in Mendix Studio, you can add a list of items and show the item details selected in this list. Depending on your use case, you might want to show a list of items on one page and show item details on a separate pop-up page, or you can show a list of items and item details on the same page.

The following how-tos are available here:

* [Configure a List and a Pop-Up Page with List Item Details](/studio-how-to/pages-how-to-configure-list-and-pop-up-page/) – describes how to configure a list on a page and show the list item details on a pop-up page
* [Configure a List and View List Item Details on One Page](/studio-how-to/pages-how-to-configure-list-and-details-on-one-page/) – shows how to create a list of items and view the item details selected in this list on the same page
