## 1 Introduction

The **Marketplace Curation** feature is a governance capability within the Mendix Platform. With this feature, you can translate the company's policies and guidelines for public Marketplace content to curation settings. Marketplace components that meet these requirements will get a recommended label. This way, developers from your company can easily see which public content is recommended according to your company policies and guidelines. This functionality provides several key benefits:
* Developer guidance: Developers can easily identify Marketplace content suitable for their apps by filtering Marketplace content by the recommended label in Studio Pro's Marketplace section or on the Marketplace website. This helps developers find valuable and relevant content for app development in your company.
* Enhanced marketplace exploration: By specifying criteria for recommended content, developers can explore a wider array of public content, enabling them to leverage resources for their apps.
* Governance control: Centralized curation allows Mendix Admins to translate the offline policies and guidelines to an in-platform experience, establishing efficient communication and time-saving processes between developers and Mendix Admins.

The **Marketplace Curation** page contains two tabs: the [Curation Settings](#curation-settings) tab and the [Marketplace Content List](#marketplace-content-list) tab.

## 2 Curation Settings {#curation-settings}

On the **Curation Settings** tab, you can configure company policies and guidelines for public Marketplace content. Select the support types and license types. Public Marketplace components that meet your requirements will be automatically labeled as recommended. For instance, in the following example, any component supported by the **Community** or **Platform** and licensed under **Apache v2** or **BSD 2.0** will be labeled as recommended.

## 3 Marketplace Content List {#marketplace-content-list}

On the **Marketplace Content List** tab, you can find all public Marketplace content in the list. The list includes information about whether a component carries the recommended label, and if so, the source of that label. The source can be either **Curation Setting** or **Manual**.

You can manually add or remove a label after selecting the content from the list. For content not recommended based on your curation settings, you can manually add the label by clicking the **Add Label** button. Conversely, for content recommended based on the curation settings, you can manually remove the label by clicking the **Remove Label** button.

{{% alert color="info" %}}If you manually add a recommended label to a Marketplace component, this Marketplace component will always keep the recommended label even if the curation settings get changed later. However, if you manually remove a recommended label from a Marketplace component, then the recommended label can automatically appear again if the curation settings get changed later. {{% /alert %}}

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/marketplace-curation/marketplace-content-list.png" max-width=100% class="image-border" alt=''marketplace-content-list''  >}}

The list shows the following details:

* **Content Name** – This shows the name of the content.
* **Support** – This shows the support type of the content.
* **Updated on** – This shows the date when the content was most recently updated.
* **License** – This shows the license of the content.
* **Label** – This shows whether the content has a recommended label.
* **Source** – This indicates the origin of the label:
  * **Curation Setting**  – The content is recommended automatically based on the curation settings.
  * **Manual** – The recommended label is added manually by a Mendix Admin.


## 4 Displaying Recommended Marketplace Content in Studio Pro {#displaying-recommended-mp-content}
In Studio Pro's Marketplace section, developers can view all the Marketplace components, no matter they have a recommended label or not. To only see recommended content, simply select the **Show Recommended** check box. The recommended label is also visible on the details page within the main panel.
