The Mendix Documentation Team aims to keep links to documentation working throughout the Mendix Platform, and we have a system in place to ensure this happens. However, we need to know where you are linking to Mendix documentation for our system to work.

Please contact the Documentation Team when you are linking to documentation from Mendix product UI, training material, blog posts, marketing material, or anywhere else in the platform. You will then be notified when a documentation link changes.
