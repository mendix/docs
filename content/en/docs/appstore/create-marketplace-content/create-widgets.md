## 1 Introduction

To develop widgets and submit them to Marketplace, follow these guidelines:

* The widget should be [pluggable](/howto/extensibility/create-a-pluggable-widget-one/).
* When writing variable and function names, use lower camel case, for example, `mySecondVariable`.
* Add code comments.
* Use descriptive variable and function names in both XML and JavaScript.
* A function should contain at most 200 lines of code.
* A function should only do one thing and do it properly.
* Use hooks and functional components over class components.
* Create test pages for mobile when content is made for mobile platforms.
