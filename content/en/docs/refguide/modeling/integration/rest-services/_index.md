## Introduction

Representational state transfer (REST) is an approach to consuming or exposing resources. It has gained popularity because of its simplicity, as no extensive schemas or contracts are needed to transfer data between endpoints. It uses the following:

* HTTP URLs to locate resources
* HTTP headers to authenticate and specify content types (such as XML or JSON)
* HTTP methods to identify operations on resources, such as GET (retrieve data) or POST (send data)

To publish REST services, see:

* [Published REST Services](/refguide/published-rest-services/), an overview in the Studio Pro guide
* [Publish a REST Service](/howto/integration/publish-rest-service/) for step-by-step instructions
* [HttpRequest and HttpResponse System Entities](/refguide/http-request-and-response-entities/), an overview of these system entities in your domain model

To consume REST services, see:

* [Consumed REST Services](/refguide/consumed-rest-services/), an overview in the Studio Pro guide
* [Call REST Service](/refguide/call-rest-action/), a description of the microflow action
