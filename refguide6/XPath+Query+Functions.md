The following XPath query aggregate functions are available:

*   [avg](XPath+avg)
*   [count](XPath+count)
*   [id](XPath+id)
*   [max](XPath+max)
*   [min](XPath+min)
*   [sum](XPath+sum)

These functions must contain full queries as their arguments. However, the functions _avg, max, min_ and _sum_ must specify a specific column in the query to aggregate.
