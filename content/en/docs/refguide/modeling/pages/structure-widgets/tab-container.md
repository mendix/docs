## 1 Introduction

Tab containers are used to show information categorized into tabs. This can be very useful if the amount of information that has to be displayed is larger than the amount of space on the screen.

## 3 Tab Page {#tab-page}

A tab container contains one or more tab pages where you place widgets. For example, a tab page can contain a grid of orders.

### 3.1 Tab Page-Specific Properties

#### 3.1.1 Default Tab Page

**Default tab page** defines which tab is displayed when the page is opened. If no tab is set as the default one, the first tab page will be shown. 

Default: *False*

#### 3.1.2 Refresh on Show {#refresh}

**Refresh on show** indicates whether the contents of the tab page should be refreshed when the tab page is shown. Set this property to *No* if you know that nothing will affect the information on the tab page.

Default: *True*
