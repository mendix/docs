## 2022

### October 26th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.19.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.19/#9190).
* We added a new workflow activity named **Call workflow** that enables calling another workflow from the current workflow and using it as a sub-workflow. This allows you to split your workflows into smaller reusable workflows.

#### Improvements

* We removed **Create Feedback Item** from the **Buzz** pane to keep only popular actions there used for collaboration.

### October 17th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for Workflow Commons 2.3.1 (a workflow-specific module).

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue when the page was scrolled to the top while you were selecting a page parameter.

### September 30th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.18.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.18/#9180).

* We made page modeling easier and faster by introducing multiple page parameters. They make it much simpler to use multiple objects that do not have an association. Previously you needed to use a data view with a microflow as a data source for that.

    A page parameter is an input that needs to be passed from the calling page or a microflow to the current page. Page parameters determine information that can be re-used on the page and provide context to data views. You can add multiple top-level data views, each connected to a different parameter. For example, you can show Employee’s data in one data view and Order’s data in another data view adding two correlating page parameters to the page.

    Page parameters can be referred to from both top-level data views and data views placed inside other data views. Additionally, you can select associations of a page parameter, reducing the need for an additional data view just to be able to follow the association, therefore reducing complexity of the page. For more information, see [Page Parameter](/studio/page-parameter/).

* We added new functions that you can use in [expressions](/studio/expressions/): *Begin-of date function calls* that calculate the beginning of the day, week, month, or year and return the value, and *End-of date function calls* that calculate the end of the day, week, month, or year and return the value.

* We added out-of-the-box functionality to the **Workflow Commons** module allowing you to jump to different activities in running workflows, for example, this functionality can be when an Administrator needs to fix workflows in an incompatible state. This functionality replaces the advanced **Generate Jump-To Options** and **Apply Jump-To Option** microflow activities. These advanced activities are only available in Studio Pro now**.** If you have microflows that use these activities,  you will be able to see them in Studio, but you will not be able to add new **Generate Jump-To Options** and **Apply Jump-To Option** activities from the **Toolbox**.

### September 15th, 2022

#### New Features

* We introduced the **Generate Jump-To Options** and **Apply Jump-To Option** microflow activities that allow app users to jump to different workflow activities in a running workflow. This functionality also enables users, for example, an Administrator, to fix workflows in an incompatible state (for instance, when a current activity has been removed). The [Workflow Commons](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/workflow-commons/) module version 2.3.0 and above has this functionality implemented on Admin pages.
* We added support for Workflow Commons 2.3.0 (a workflow-specific module).  

### August 31st, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.17/#9170).

### August 17th, 2022

#### Improvements

* In the data view properties, the **Show Footer** property now adds **Save** and **Cancel** buttons to the data view by default. This will save your time when configuring a form on a page. For more information on data view properties, see the [General Section](/studio/page-editor-data-view-list-view/#general-section-data-view) in *Data View and List View*. 
* To avoid errors in your app, the upgrade of MendixSSO and Atlas Core modules is blocked when they have custom modifications. You can contact your team members who are using Studio Pro to upgrade these modules.  

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where publishing an app with SVG images failed.

### August 4th, 2022

#### Improvements

* We now detect dependencies between modules when you update them and notify you about these dependencies. Sometimes you need to upgrade or downgrade modules for them to be compatible with each other.

### July 29th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.16.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.16/#9160).

### July 21st, 2022

### New Features

* To help you configure pages faster, we added the **Generate content for data view** option that you can select when choosing an entity for the data view widget: 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/releasenotes/studio/9.7-and-above/generate-content-data-view.jpg" >}}

    This option will populate data view with input widgets that correlate with every attribute of the selected entity. For example, if you select the *Customer* entity that has *FullName* and *Address* attributes of string types, the data view will get two text box widgets labelled *FullName* and *Address*.

### July 15th, 2022

#### New Features

* We made it possible to use custom actions added in Studio Pro in microflows in Studio. Microflows and Java actions can be exposed in Studio Pro as custom actions for the microflow toolbox. This is a very useful feature when you would like to provide a set of standard actions specific to your company to developers. For example, you can distribute a set of communication actions using your company’s specific e-mail connector. Actions that are exposed now appear in defined categories in both Studio and Studio Pro, previously they were visible only in Studio Pro. For more information on exposing a microflow or Java action in Studio Pro, see the [Expose as Microflow Action](/refguide/microflow/#expose-as-microflow) section in *Microflow Properties* and the [Expose as Microflow Action](/refguide/java-actions/#expose-microflow-action) section in *Java Actions*.
* We added support for Workflow Commons 2.2.0 (a workflow-specific module).  

### July 11th, 2022

#### Improvements

* When you drag and drop a parameter to the microflow editor working area, it gets a default name. This improvement speeds up the process of configuring a microflow. 

### June 30th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.15.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.15/#9150).
* We added new expressions – Subtract Date Functions Calls that allow you subtract a time period from a date and time and return the modified value. For example, to check if the due date was expired more than a week ago you can use the following expression: `$workflowContext/DueDate < subtractDays([%CurrentDateTime%], 7)`.
* We added `addQuarters` and `addQuartersUTC` functions to Add Date Function Calls.

### June 24th, 2022

#### Improvements

* You can now use external entities from the Data Hub for the Workflow Context. 

### June 15th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.14.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.14/#9140).
* We added support for Workflow Commons 2.1.2 (a workflow-specific module).  

#### Improvements

* We improved error messages for errors CE0115 and CE0127 and made messages more user-friendly.
* We made the behavior for workflow and microflow custom actions consistent: custom action categories are displayed open in the **Toolbox** now. 
* We made the description of the Administration module in the **Mendix Version & Add-Ons** screen more user-friendly. 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue when long names of elements in the **Toolbox** were not wrapped to several lines. 

### June 3rd, 2022

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where custom widgets were not rendered correctly when you dragged and dropped them on a page. 
* We fixed an issue where country flag icons were not shown when you had several languages in your app.

### May 19th, 2022

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where duplicating a workflow resulted in user task and default workflow pages from the original workflow being mapped to the duplicated workflow and no consistency error shown.
* We fixed the drag-and-drop issue in the workflow editor.
* We fixed an issue of not seeing custom widgets in the **Toolbox** on pages but seeing a message about the Marketplace being down.

### May 9th, 2022

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue with a horizontal scrollbar that appeared when you selected attributes in the Approval Request workflow wizard. For more information on the wizard, see [How to Configure a Workflow Using the Wizard in Studio](/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure-using-wizard/) in *Studio 9 How-tos*.
* We fixed an issue where you could fill in invalid characters using the Approval Request workflow wizard. Now you can only fill in valid characters.
* We fixed an issue where the **Bring me back** button did not work when using the Approval Request workflow wizard.
* We fixed an issue where workflow-related entities were not selectable. 
* We fixed an issue where the custom icons were not rendered properly in the workflow editor and the **Toolbox**. 
* We fixed an issue where enumeration captions were not filled in when you used the **App from a spreadsheet**. 
* We fixed an issue where long external entities names broke the **Select** dialog. 

### April 29th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.13.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.13/#9130).

#### Improvements

* We extended the expression language with four new tokens to make it very easy to evaluate against yesterday or tomorrow.
* We changed the **Return Value** category of the **Call Microflow** activity in microflows and workflows to **Output** for more consistency. 
* We added new video tutorials on how to build an app to the **Help & Learning** to enable you to learn how to use Studio faster. 
* With workflows being re-enabled and made generally available in Studio for apps in Mendix version 9.12.1 or above, we updated the upgrading     process for existing apps: 
    * If your app has Mendix version 9.6 or above and does **not** yet have workflows, you can upgrade automatically in Studio to Mendix 9.12.1 or above and start using workflows.
    * If your app has Mendix version 9.5.1 or above and has workflows (which were in Beta) enabled, your app can only be upgraded manually by a team member using Studio Pro. For information on how to upgrade the app, see [Migrating Workflow Apps](/refguide/workflow-beta-migration/) in *Studio Pro Guide*. 

### April 14th, 2022

#### New Features

* Workflows are now fully available in Studio: workflow functionality is not in Beta anymore, so you can use your apps with workflows in production now. For more information on workflows and how to create them, see [Workflows](/studio/workflows/). 
* We added the Approval Flow wizard when you create a workflow. If your use case falls under approval process, for example, approving vacation days for your team, you can use the wizard to create the app automatically: you define data type, and the wizard sets up the rest, including a workflow, relevant pages, and navigation. For more information, see [How to Configure a Workflow Using the Wizard in Studio](/studio-how-to/workflow-how-to-configure-using-wizard/) in *Studio 9 How-tos*. 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where security was not configured correctly in app templates that had Mendix SSO installed. As a result, users were not redirected to the correct login page when they published their apps.

### March 29th, 2022

#### New Features

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.12.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.12/#9120).
* You can now disable an activity in a microflow. This is useful when you are in the process of building and testing the microflow and would like to temporarily exclude an activity from the flow. Open the **Properties** tab of the activity and click the **More** icon > **Disable** at the bottom of the tab. When you need to re-enable the activity back, you can always do so in its properties. For more information, see the [Disabling an Activity](/studio/microflows/#disable) section in *Microflows*. 

### March 10th, 2022

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where the dialog box for selecting attributes did not show attributes of associated entities.
* We fixed an issue where the entire breadcrumb in the page editor was selected when clicking on the layout option in the breadcrumb. 
* We fixed an issue where native widget packages were shown in the **Widget Overview** screen.
