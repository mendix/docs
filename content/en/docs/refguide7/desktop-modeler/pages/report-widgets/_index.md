With reporting, you can create reports over the database data. Reporting is used for creating aggregated information (for example , the total sales per customer).

The difference between a data grid and a report grid is that the data shown in the report grid is not stored in the database. Each time a report is created, the data is retrieved from the database. Data for the reporting widgets is provided by [Datasets](/refguide7/data-sets/).

A report can be presented on a [Page](/refguide7/page/) in a tabular form using a [Report Grid](/refguide7/report-grid/) widget or in a graphical form using a [Report Chart](/refguide7/report-chart/) widget. If the [Data Set](/refguide7/data-sets/) corresponding to the report contains parameters, these can be specified by the user via the [Report Parameter](/refguide7/report-parameter/) and [Report Date Parameter](/refguide7/report-date-parameter/) widgets. Note that all of the report parameters are optional, so it is not obligatory to specify all parameters.
