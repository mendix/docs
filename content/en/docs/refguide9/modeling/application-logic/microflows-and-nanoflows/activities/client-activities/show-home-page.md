## 1 Introduction

The **Show home page** activity opens the home page for an end-user. For example, you can navigate your user to the home page when they are not logged in. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/application-logic/microflows-and-nanoflows/activities/client-activities/show-home-page/show-home-page.png" alt="Show Home Page"   width="200"  class="no-border" >}}

This activity shows the same page that is displayed to the end-user after they log in, meaning it shows the home page defined for the current user role. For more information on role-based home pages, see [Navigation](/refguide9/navigation/).
