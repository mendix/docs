## 7.5.0

**Release date: July 12th, 2017**

### Export mappings

We introduced a new way of getting Mendix objects in export mappings: `from parameter`.

This has always been the default (unseen) value for the root element, but it can now be chosen anywhere in the mapping. As a result, the input to an export mapping may be a list of Mendix objects (whereas before, it always had to be a single Mendix object).

### Fixes

* We fixed the ability to use a client certificate for a web or REST service that has a server certificate signed by a non-standard authority. (Tickets 52427, 52937)
* We fixed the default sort order for drop-down search fields in grids to be the selected attribute path. (Ticket 53810)
* We fixed the issue that occurred when a logout from a hybrid app would be stuck with a loader.
* We fixed the exception that occurred during the creation of a web service user when project security was disabled. (Ticket 53128)
* We now populate the **Size** attribute of file documents without commit events. (Ticket 54099)
* We fixed the issue when a redirect from a normal index page to index-rtl (for right-to-left languages) failed.
* Fix life cycle for widgets inside conditionally hidden containers. They were not destroyed properly and that led to performance issues. [Ticket 53719]
* When a conditional visible widget is re-displayed it could display stale values, we fixed this for you. [Ticket 52466, 53719]
