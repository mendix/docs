## Introduction

Events are elements that are displayed as circles on a flow of your microflow and are usually placed at the end or the beginning of the flow:

For example, they are used to start or end your microflow, to break an iteration in a loop, or continue this iteration, depending on the type of the event. All of the events can be used both in a microflow or nanoflow, except for the error event. 

You can add the following events to your flow:

* [Start Event](/refguide8/start-event/) – indicates the beginning of your microflow or nanoflow 
* [End Event](/refguide8/end-event/) – defines where the flow stops
* [Error Event](/refguide8/error-event/) – defines where the microflow will stop and throw an error
* [Continue Event](/refguide8/continue-event/) – used in loops to stop the current iteration and start the iteration of the next object
* [Break Event](/refguide8/break-event/) – used in loops to exit the loop and continue with the rest of the flow
