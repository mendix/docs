Call microflow properties consist of the following sections:

* [General](#general)
* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Outcomes](#outcomes)

### 2.1 General Section {#general}

The **General** section allows you to define a caption for the action and to select a microflow.  

The section properties are described in the table below:

| Property  | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Caption   | The **Caption** describes what happens in this element. It is displayed in the workflow editor to make the workflow easier to read and understand. |
| Microflow | The microflow that is called by this element.                |

### 2.3 Parameters Section {#parameters}

Parameters pass data to the element. Currently the parameters can only be selected and configured in Studio Pro. For more information, see [Call Microflow](/refguide/call-microflow/).

### 2.2 Outcomes Section {#outcomes}

**Outcomes** depends on the return value of the microflow. For example, for the Boolean, you have **true** and **false** outcomes, while for the enumeration â€“ an outcome per each enumeration value and an empty one when the value is unassigned.
