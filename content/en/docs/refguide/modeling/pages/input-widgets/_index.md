## 1 Introduction

Input elements show data to the end-user and, optionally, allow them to edit the data.

Input elements need to be linked to an attribute of an entity in order to function. As such, they must be placed within a data widget containing by an object of that entity type.

For example, the input elements can be placed inside a [data view](/refguide/data-view/):

There are several different input elements, these are used for different [data types](/refguide/data-types/) and for different types of [association](/refguide/associations/). The input elements category contains the following widgets:

* [Text Box](/refguide/text-box/) – displays and, optionally, allows the end-user to add or edit text data from a *numeric* or *string-like* attribute:

* [Text Area](/refguide/text-area/) – displays and, optionally, allows the end-user to add or edit long text data from a *string* attribute:

* [Drop-Down](/refguide/drop-down/) – shows the current value of and, optionally, allows end-users to pick an option from a list of options in an *enumeration* attribute:

* [Checkbox](/refguide/check-box/) – shows the current value of and, optionally, allows end-users to set a *Boolean* attribute to `true` or `false`:

* [Radio Buttons](/refguide/radio-buttons/) – shows the current value of and, optionally, allows end-users to pick an option from a list of options in an *enumeration* attribute or the value of a *Boolean* attribute:

* [Date Picker](/refguide/date-picker/) – shows and, optionally, allows end-users to pick a *Date and time* attribute from a calendar:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/pages/input-widgets/date-picker.png" alt="Date picker showing the last contacted attribute" >}}

* [Reference Selector](/refguide/reference-selector/) – shows and, optionally, allows end-users to select a *one-to-one* or *one-to-many* association using the value of a *string*, *numeric*, *enumeration*, or *Date and time* attribute on the associated object:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/pages/input-widgets/reference-selector.png" alt="Reference selector showing company name attribute of associated company" >}}

* [Reference Set Selector](/refguide/reference-set-selector/) –  lists with one or more attributes and, optionally, allows the end-user to add and remove associated objects linked via a *many-to-many* association:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/pages/input-widgets/reference-set-selector.png" alt="Reference set selector showing details of associated products" >}}

* [Input Reference Set Selector](/refguide/input-reference-set-selector/) – shows an attribute from and, optionally, allows the user to add and remove associated objects linked via a *many-to-many* association:
