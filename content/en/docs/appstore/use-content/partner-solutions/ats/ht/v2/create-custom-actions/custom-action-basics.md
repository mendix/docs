## Introduction

This how-to explains the basics of creating a custom action. You must complete this how-to before proceeding with [How to Create Custom Actions](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/ht-two-create-custom-actions/).

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Create a custom action
* Add parameters
* Connect parameters

## Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Have a general knowledge of ATS
* Read [How to Get Started](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/ht-two-getting-started/)
* Read [How to Create a Test Case](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/ht-two-create-a-test-case/)
* Read [Guidelines for Creating a Custom Action](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/ht-two-guidelines-custom-action/)

## Creating a Custom Action

The following sections describe how to create a custom action. There are two options for creating a custom action:

* Click the **Actions** drop-down menu in the **Repository** and select **New Action**
* Use the **Extract Action** button

### Option 1 – Using the Add Item Button in the Repository

1. Open your app in ATS and go to **Test Cases**.
2. Click the **Actions** drop-down menu in the **Repository** tab.
3. Select **New Action**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/repository-add-action.png" class="no-border" >}}

    This opens the **Create new** dialog box:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/create-new-action-dialog.png" class="no-border" >}}

4. Enter a name in the **Name** field (for example, *Set Drop-Down*). It is advisable to use a name that describes what the action does.
5. Enter a description in the **Description** field (for example, *This action sets the drop-down menu to a specific value*). It is advisable to give each action a detailed description of what it does.
6. Click **Create**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/create-new-action-dialog-complete.png" class="no-border" >}}

You have now created a custom action from the repository.

### Option 2 – Using the Extract Action Button

To use the **Extract Action** button, follow these steps:

1. Open your app in ATS and go to **Test Cases**.
2. Select a test case or action and open it.
3. Select the test steps you want to combine in a custom action by clicking the checkbox in front of the step.
4. Click **Extract Action**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/test-case-extract-action.png" class="no-border" >}}

    This opens the **Action - Set Details** dialog box.
5. Enter a name in the **Name** field (for example, *Set Drop-Down*).
6. Enter a description in the **Description** field (for example, *This action sets the drop-down menu to a specific value*).
7. Click **Close**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/test-case-action-set-details.png" class="no-border" >}}

8. Select the newly created action and click **Open**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/test-case-open-new-action.png" class="no-border" >}}

Both ways open the **Action Details** page. This page works the same as the **Test Case Details** page. You add test steps by clicking **Setup step manually** or by clicking **Record step**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/action-details-page-add-record.png" class="no-border" >}}

## Adding Parameters

To add parameters to your custom action, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Action Details** page of your action.
2. Click the **Settings** tab:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/action-details-page-settings.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Follow the steps in the sections below for adding input and output parameters.

### Adding Input Parameters

To add input parameters, follow these steps:

1. Click **New**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/action-details-page-settings-new.png" class="no-border" >}}

    This will open the **Edit Input Parameter** dialog box.

2. Enter a name in the **Name** field (for example, *Widget Name*). Use the ATS naming convention.
3. Enter a description in the **Description** field (for example, *Enter the name of the widget*). Note that you should make sure everybody understands what information they must enter.  
4. Select a data type from the **Datatype** drop-down menu (for example, **Text**).
5. Select a **Show as Password** option. This makes the parameter field unreadable. The default setting is **No**.
6. Select a **Required/Optional** option. For example, the **Widget Name** parameter is always required, otherwise the action does not work.
7. Click **Save**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/new-action-edit-input-parameter.png" class="no-border" >}}

You can add as many input parameters as you need, but remember to keep the action simple.

### Adding an Output Parameter

To add an output parameter, follow these steps:

1. Click **Set**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/action-details-page-settings-set.png" class="no-border" >}}

    This opens the different **Output Parameter** fields.

2. Enter a name in the **Name** field (for example, *Element*). The user must know what the action returns, so be clear in the name that you enter.  
3. Enter a description in the **Description** field. Use this field to give a more detailed description of what is returned.
4. Select a data type from the **Datatype** drop-down menu (for example, *Page Element*).
5. Select a **Required/Optional** option. Only use **Optional** if the action still works when nothing is returned.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/new-action-output-parameter-complete.png" class="no-border" >}}

6. The **Output Parameter** requires additional steps. Go to the **Test Steps** tab and click **Add**.
7. Add the [Find/Assert Widget](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/rg-one-findassert-widget/) action and the [Set Return Value](/appstore/partner-solutions/ats/rg-one-set-return-value/) action.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/output-parameter-actions.png" class="no-border" >}}

8. For ATS to return the outcome of a test step as an **Output Parameter**, it needs to know what it must return. ATS returns the **Value** connected to the **Set Return Value** action. Now, connect the outcome of test step 1 to the **Set Return Value** action.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/partner-solutions/ats/ht/v2/create-custom-actions/custom-action-basics/set-return-value-parameter.png" class="no-border" >}}

    Make sure the data type of the **Output Parameter** corresponds with data type of the connected outcome.

    ATS will the outcome of test step 1.

## Connecting the Input Parameters

To connect the input parameter, follow these steps:

1. Select the test step to which you want to connect an input parameter.
2. Open the parameter drop-down menu.
3. Select the input parameter you want to connect.
