Example usage.

## A-K

### application & app

An "application" or "app" can be one of the following:

* A local application
* A [Free App](#free-app)
* A licensed application hosted on the Mendix Cloud; another cloud such as AWS, SAP Cloud, or IBM Cloud Portal; or on the user's own server

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use "app" or "application" when referring to apps in general. Do not capitalize (meaning, do not write "Mendix App").<br />
<br />
The full word "application" has a more well-rounded meaning to it (as in, web and mobile apps), whereas "app" may suggest just mobile apps to the reader. Accordingly, it can be better to use "application" at the beginning of documents and then switch to "app" later on. We want to make it clear that Mendix is not just for building mobile apps, but all kinds of applications.<br />
<br />
It is useful to differentiate "app" from "app project" when referring to what the user works on for project management. For more information, see [app project](#app-project).
{{% /alert %}}

### App ID

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Always capitalize.
{{% /alert %}}

### app project {#app-project}

"App" should be used instead of "project" as much as possible (despite the fact that "project" is still used throughout Studio Pro). 

Use "app project" where necessary for clarification (for example, for project management-related tasks in the Developer Portal).

{{% alert type="success" %}}
Enter the email addresses of all the co-workers you want to invite to your app project.
{{% /alert %}}

### App Store component

This is the generic name of the individual add-on, widget, module, connector, app template, etc. available in the Mendix App Store.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use "App Store item."<br />
<br />
Use "App Store content" (and not "App Store components") to describe in general what is available in the Mendix App Store.
{{% /alert %}}

### App Team

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize, because **Team** is capitalized in the Developer Portal UI.
{{% /alert %}}

### app template {#app-template}

This is the term to use to reflect the create-new-app flow UI in the Developer Portal.

There are two inconsistencies in other areas of the platform UI:

* When creating a new company app template to add to the App Store as a component, you have to select **Starter Apps** as the **Sub category**
* In the App Store, "sample apps" continues to be the menu item for app templates

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not use "starter app."
{{% /alert %}}

### App User

For a definition of this term, see the [Managing App Users](/developerportal/settings/general-settings#managing-app-users) section of the *Developer Portal Guide*.

{{% /alert %}}

### Free App {#free-app}

A [Free App](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy#free-app) is an app that can be deployed without a license and is therefore free. There are restrictions on the resources available to a Free App. A Free App environment is a cloud environment, but it does not support complex or large applications. Free Apps are part of the [Free Edition](#free-edition).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Capitalize in all instances.<br />
<br />
Do not use "Sandbox." For more information, see [Terminology History](terminology-history).
{{% /alert %}}

### Free Edition {#free-edition}

This is the package of offerings that users can employ without requiring a paid license.

"Free Edition" replaced [Community Edition](terminology-history#community-edition) in 2015, and was made a focus of the announcements at [Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Use to refer to the whole package of Mendix free offerings (Studio Pro, Studio, and Free Apps), not individual parts of the offering.<br />
<br />
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### guided product introduction tour

This describes the user guidance that is built into Mendix Studio. This is a generic term, so it can be applied as more user guidance is built.

It should be qualified by the context/location. In the case of Studio, the generic term is qualified by the context/location in the [Studio Release Notes](/releasenotes/studio/) like this: "A guided product introduction tour is now shown when you select **Start Your First App** from the **Introduction Tour** category when creating an app in the [Mendix Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/)."

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Do not capitalize.

<br />
Capitalize in all instances.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix mobile app {#mendix-mobile-app}

[Mendix](/refguide/getting-the-mendix-app) is the name for the mobile app available for developers to test hybrid mobile apps using PhoneGap.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
This term replaces "Mendix Developer app" and "Mendix Mobile app" (which are not to be used in the product UI or documentation – for more information, see [Terminology History](terminology-history)).<br />
<br />
To avoid confusion with "Mendix" in all its other usages, always use "the Mendix mobile app" and cross-reference [Getting the Mendix Mobile App](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/getting-the-mendix-app) where possible.
