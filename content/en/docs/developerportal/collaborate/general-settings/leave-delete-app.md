## 1 Introduction

You can create a new app in one click and leave the app just as easily when you are not using it anymore. However, if you are thinking about leaving an app, consider carefully whether you may want to use that app later for any reason.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following as a Scrum Master:**

* Leave an app
* Delete an app
* Deactivate an app

## 2 Prerequisites

Before you delete or deactivate an app, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* You need to have the **Scrum Master** role in your team (or a custom role with the **App Settings** permission).
* You should not be the **Technical Contact** of the app.

## 3 Leaving, Deleting, or Deactivating an App

If you want to leave and delete your app, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com), click **Apps** in the top menu bar, and select the app that you want to leave.

2. In the app's sidebar menu, select **Collaborate** > **General Settings**.

3. At the bottom of the **General** tab, click one of the following buttons:

    * Click **Leave App** to leave the app.

    If you leave an app that still has team members, you will leave the app directly after clicking **Leave App**. The app will still exist in the company, and it will be available for other team members. If you want to return to the team, other team members can invite you to the app again.

    If you are the only member of the team, you will get a final confirmation message. The pop-up window states the app will be **permanently deleted**, when you leave as the last member. Confirm leaving and deleting the app by clicking **Leave and Delete App**. This change cannot be reverted and will be fully deleted from your company.

    * Click **Deactivate App** to deactivate the app

    * Click **Delete App** to delete the app

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}Only Free Apps can be deleted. App deletion cannot be undone, which means that ALL DATA WILL BE LOST, including all files on the [Team Server](/developerportal/collaborate/team-server/) and all data in the Free App node.{{% /alert %}}

## 4 Alternative Method

If you are the only team member of an app, you can also leave and delete the app directly from your list of apps. For more information, see [My Apps](/developerportal/#my-apps).
