## 1 Introduction

When you have created your app, it is important to be able to manage it. There are several pages in the Developer Portal that allow you to look at the app's performance and to ensure that data is backed up and can be restored under your control.

Access to operations information is divided into four pages: Metrics, Alerts, Logs, and Backups.

Metrics, alerts, and logs are not available for Free Apps running in Mendix Cloud, and you cannot make manual backups of Free Apps.
