The module roles define which roles users of this module can have. See [Security](/refguide7/security/) for more information on module roles and [user roles](/refguide7/user-roles/) and their relation.

## Name

The name of a module role is used to refer to the module role from other elements in your model.

End users do not see the names of module roles. End users (if they create or view user accounts) only see the names of [user roles](/refguide7/user-roles/).
