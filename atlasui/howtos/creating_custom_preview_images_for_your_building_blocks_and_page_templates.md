#### Creating a Preview Image in Sketch
Download the [Atlas UI image templates resources pack](https://atlas.mendix.com/p/resources/7881299347899269). Open the Sketch file ```BB_previewimage.sketch```. This file contains two artboards. The first artboard shows an example of how custom preview images look in the Web Modeler's toolbox. The second artboard is where you place your image. Hide the layer called "Template" and insert your preview image into the "Building Block preview” folder.

When you are happy with your image, select your artboard. In the Export dialogue that appears in the bottom right of your screen, make sure the preferences are set to size: 1x, format: PNG. Export your image.
