For the [Find Widget Child Node action](find-widget-child-node)  or as part of a script for [Execute JavaScript Integer](execute-javascript-integer), [Execute JavaScript String](execute-javascript-string) and [Execute JavaScript WebElement](execute-javascript-webelement) actions, you will have to use selectors to get a node or WebElement. ATS supports both, JQuery and CSS3 selectors. In addition to that, ATS includes its own selectors. The following summary will give you a short overview of the most commonly used selectors in ATS.

### ATS Selectors
You can use the custom ATS selectors like CSS3 selectors in your custom actions.

Pattern |Name | Meaning
-----|---------|--------
:clickable | Clickable pseudo-class | Selects a user interface element whose CSS visibility property is set to visible.
:containsExact(*text*) | ContainsExact pseudo-class | Selects a element whose inner HTML is exactly equal to the given text (**not** case sensitive)
:containsExactCase(*text*) | ContainsExactCase pseudo-class |Selects a element whose inner HTML is exactly equal to the given text (case sensitive)
:containsRegex(*regex*) | ContainsRegex pseudo-class | Selects a element whose inner HTML matches the given regex.  
:containsText(*text*) | ContainsText pseudo-class | Selects a element whose inner text value is equal to the given text. Can only be used on text, CDATA and element nodes
:val(*text*) | Value pseudo-class | Selects a input, select or textarea whose value is equal to the given text

### CSS Selectors
You can use any CSS Selector defined in CSS3 and supported by your browser. The following table shows some of the commonly used CSS3 selectors in ATS.

 Pattern |Name | Meaning
-----|---------|--------
 .myClass |Class Selector | Selects every element with class **myClass**
 #myID | ID Selector |Selects every element with ID **myID**
 E[foo="bar"] |Attribute Selector | Selects every element E  whose "**foo**" attribute value is equal to "**bar**"
 :nth-child(n) |Nth-child pseudo-class | Selects the **n-th** child of its parent
 :first-child |First-Child pseudo-class | Selects the **first** child of its parent
 :last-child |Last-Child pseudo-class | Selects the **last** child of its parent
 :checked |Checked pseudo-class | Selects a user interface element which is **checked**
 E > F |Child Combinator | Selects an **F element child** of an E element

### JQuery Selectors
JQuery uses CSS3 selectors and extends the collection of selectors with its own ones. You can use those in your ATS actions.

If you use JQuery selectors in the [Find Widget Child Node](find-widget-child-node) action, you **mustn't** use the *jQuery(...)* or *$(...)* function. Only use simple selectors, without quotation.

In the [Execute JavaScript actions](execute-javascript-integer), you will have to use the *jQuery(...)* or *$(...)* function to select a WebElement or node.

The following table shows some of the additional JQuery selectors you can use in ATS.      

Pattern |Name | Meaning
-----|---------|--------
 :animated | Animated Selector | Selects all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run
 :checkbox | Checkbox Selector | Selects all elements of type checkbox.
 :input | Input Selector | Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements.
 :has(*selector*) | Has Selector | Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified *selector*.
 :parent | Parent Selector | Select all elements that have at least one child node (either an element or text).
 :text | Text Selector | Selects all input elements of type text.
