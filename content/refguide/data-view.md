## 1 Introduction

The data view is a central component of Mendix applications. It is the starting point for showing the contents of exactly one object. For example, if you want to show the details of a single customer, you can use a data view to do this. The data view typically contains input widgets like text boxes with labels. In more complex screens, a data view can contain tab controls per topic (for example, address and payment information) and data views and data grids for related objects (for example, order history or wish list).

{{% alert type="info" %}}

{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Components

### 2.1 Data View Contents Area

The data view contents area is where all the layout and input widgets go. Often the contents area contains a table with two columns: the first column showing labels and the second column containing input widgets. Other layouts are possible, as you can see in the examples above.

### 2.2 Data View Footer

The footer of the data view is the section at the bottom of the data view that often contains buttons to confirm or cancel the page. However, arbitrary widgets are allowed. The footer will stick to the bottom if the data view is the only top-level widget.

## 4 General Properties

### 4.1 Form Orientation

With this property, you can specify the position of the input widget labels inside the data view. If the orientation is horizontal, the labels will be placed next to the input widgets. If the orientation is vertical, the labels will be placed above the input widgets.

Note that form groups are responsive and the labels may be placed above input widgets, even if the orientation is set to horizontal, depending on the viewport size. Also, note that a data view with a vertical orientation cannot be nested inside a data view with a horizontal orientation. In that case, the form groups will be rendered horizontally, regardless of the value of the orientation property.

_Default value:_ Horizontal

### 4.2 Label Width (Weight)

If the form orientation is set to horizontal, this property can be used to specify the width of the input widget labels inside the data view. The width is specified using column weights from the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid). For more details, see [Layout Grid](layout-grid).

_Default value:_ 3

### 4.3 Show Footer

With this property, you can specify whether you want the footer of the data view to be visible. The footer of nested data views is always invisible, regardless of the value of this property.

_Default value:_ True

### 4.4 Empty Entity Message

If this message is specified, a data view that receives no source data will show this message instead of its content. Otherwise, the data view will show its static content and disabled input widgets. This property is a translatable text. For more details, see [Translatable Texts](translatable-texts).

There are a number of ways a data view can end up without source data. For instance, a data view with a **Listen to widget** data source will remain empty until an object is selected in the target grid. In this scenario, **Empty entity message** can be used to guide the user to select an item from the grid.

_Default value:_ empty

## 5 Editability Properties

### 5.1 Editable

The editable property indicates whether the data view as a whole is editable or not. If the data view is not editable, no widget inside the data view will be editable. On the other hand, if the data view is editable, each widget is determined to be editable based on its own editable property.

_Default value:_ True

### 5.2 Read-Only Style

This property determines how input widgets are rendered if read-only. 

| Value            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Control          | The widget is displayed but disabled, so the value cannot be modified.|
| Text             | The widget is replaced by a textual representation of the value.|

*Default value:* Control

## 6 Data Source Properties

The data source determines which object will be shown in the data view. For general information about data sources, see [Data Sources](data-sources).

### 6.1 Type

The data view supports the following types of data source: context, microflow, and listen to widget. Whatever data source you select, the data view will always return one single object.

### 6.2 Entity, Microflow, Listen To Widget

See the corresponding data source for specific properties:

* [Context source](entity-path-source) - either a page parameter or a surrounding data element
* [Microflow source](microflow-source) - a microflow returning only one object
* [Listen to widget source](listen-to-grid-source) - any widget returning only one object

### 6.3 Use Schema

{{% alert type="info" %}}

This property has been deprecated in version 7.2.0 and is marked for removal in version 8.0.0.

{{% /alert %}}

Curently this has no effect.
