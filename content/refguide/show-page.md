## 2 Input Properties

{{% alert type="info" %}}

{{% /alert %}}

### 2.1 Object to pass

Object that will be passed to the opened page. This object will be used by [data views](data-view) with a page parameter data source.

## 3 Action Properties

### 3.1 Page

The [page](page) to show to the end-user. If the Object to pass is specified, the page must contain a data view connected to the same entity as the passed object (or its generalization).

{{% alert type="info" %}}

You can generate a new page to show by clicking 'Select...' and then 'New'. If you have selected an Object to pass Studio Pro will automatically generate a data view to edit that object.

{{% /alert %}}

### 3.2 Page Title

By default the title of the page is determined by the page title property of the page. You can replace this title with a custom title if necessary.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

This feature allows you to re-use the same page for the New and Edit buttons of a data grid. By simply setting the titles to, for example, 'New customer' and 'Edit customer', you can save yourself the trouble of duplicating the rest of the page.
