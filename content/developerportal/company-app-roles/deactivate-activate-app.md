## 1 Introduction

As a Company Admin, you can deactivate and activate apps within your company. This means that if a company member has left an app project but not deleted it, you can re-activate the app project for them to work on again. For more information on this type of scenario, see [How to Leave & Delete an App](../settings/leave-delete-app).

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Deactivate an app
* Activate an app

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* To deactivate or activate an app, make sure you have the **Company Admin** role in your company

## 3 Deactivating & Activating an App

There are some important points to understand when you want to deactivate or activate an app:

* Only Free Apps can be deactivated
* A deactivated app still exists in the company, but it is invisible to regular users (because only a Company Admin can activate an inactive app)
* Licensed apps with a node can only be offboarded by Mendix Support (to offboard an app, you must submit a [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us) request)

To deactivate or activate an app as a Company Admin, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com).

2.  Click your avatar in the top-right corner of the screen and select **Company Admin**:

4.  Select one of these actions to perform:

	* To deactivate an active app, select an app with a **Status** of **In Use** and click **Activate / Deactivate App**
	* To activate an inactive app, select an app with a **Status** of **Inactive** and click **Activate / Deactivate App**
