## 2 Applying to the Vendor Program

Whether you are an individual supplier with your own business or you are supplying a component on behalf of your company, you need to [apply](https://www.mendix.com/marketplace-vendor-program/#contactForm) to the Mendix Vendor Program. Since your Mendix Vendor account will be associated with your Mendix ID, make sure you have a [Mendix Platform account](https://signup.mendix.com/). 

When applying to the program, you will be asked for basic information, including your legal name and address. This information is used to check whether you want to sell your content or offer it for free.

| --- | --- |
| Account Owner | The account creatorâ€™s email address. |
| Logo | Your supplier logo. |
| Name | Supplier name (could be a company, brand, or individual). |
| Description | Describe your purpose, products, and services. |
| Company Name | The legal name of the entity that will sell or offer your content. |
| Company Address | The legal address of the entity that will sell or offer your content. |

As the owner of the Mendix Vendor account, you must have permission to legally bind your company to Mendix.

## 3 Mendix Vendor License Agreement 

Whether you are offering a free or paid component through the Marketplace, you need to accept our Mendix Vendor License Agreement, which is an agreement between Mendix and you as a Mendix Vendor within the Mendix Vendor Program.

## 4 Legal & Compliance Checks

The company registered with your account is the legal entity against which Mendix will be bound. For this reason, Mendix performs screening checks to ensure we are legally permitted to undertake business transactions together.
