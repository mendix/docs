Integration with other applications (other than Mendix) can be done using REST or SOAP/Web Services. Mendix can import and export data from XML and JSON.

Integration between Mendix applications is done best with REST Services (see [Published REST Services](/refguide7/published-rest-services/) and [Call REST Service Action](/refguide7/call-rest-action/)). Some of the terms used the most often are explained below.
