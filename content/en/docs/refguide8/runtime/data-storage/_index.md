## Introduction

Data storage is the data foundation of the Mendix Runtime. Data storage does the following:

* Connects to supported relational databases
* Stores and retrieves entities and associations from the domain model
* Translates XPath and OQL queries to SQL queries
* Handles security transparently and effectively

## Supported Databases

For apps deployed to the Mendix Cloud, Mendix uses a PostgreSQL database for storing the data defined in the app domain model(s).

If you are deploying to a different infrastructure, Mendix supports the following databases.

* IBM DB2
* HSQLDB
* MySQL
* Oracle RDBMS
* PostgreSQL
* SAP HANA
* Microsoft SQL Server
