## 1 Introduction

Here we discuss properties that are shared by many elements in the microflow editor.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

Not every element in a microflow has all of these properties.

{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Common Properties

### 2.1 Caption

The caption describes to the human user what happens in this element. Captions of action activities can be auto-generated by the Modeler. See below.

### 2.2 Auto-Generate Caption

The auto-generate caption property specifies whether the caption is automatically generated based on the type of activity.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | The caption of the activity is generated by the Modeler. |
| No | You can edit the caption yourself in the Caption property. |

_Default value_: Yes

### 2.3 Background Color

Here you can choose a background color for the activity. Colors do not influence execution; they are only used for documentation. For example, you can make error handling code red so you can easily identify it.
