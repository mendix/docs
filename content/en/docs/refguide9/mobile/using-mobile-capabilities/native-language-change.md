## 1 Introduction

This internationalization guide explains how to give your end-user an easy way to change their mobile application's language. The user can do so directly on their Android or iOS device. 

This guide shows one of the ways to change the language on a *native* app. You can also apply this guide's mechanism to *all offline PWA profiles*. Please note that this guide's mechanism does not change the localization of an application because it depends on the settings of the device.

While this guide gives your end-user the ability to switch their app's language, translation is a different issue. Translating native apps and PWAs actually works the same as it does for web apps. To learn more about app translation, see [Translating Your App Content](/refguide9/translate-your-app-content/).

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Install Mendix Studio Pro [9.14.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.14/) or above
* Complete the [Prerequisites](/refguide9/mobile/distributing-mobile-apps/building-native-apps/deploying-native-app/#prerequisites) section of *Deploy Your First Mendix Native Mobile App*
* Make sure your [Nanoflow Commons](/appstore/modules/nanoflow-commons/) module is up to date
* Read the [Language Menu](/refguide9/translatable-texts/) guide to understand the basics of the Mendix Language menu
* Set up the required [languages](/refguide9/language-settings/) in Studio Pro—this tutorial has been configured with three languages as below:

## 3 Setting up the Language Change Mechanism {#set-up}

Internationalization with Mendix's mobile apps is fairly simple. You will use two nanoflow actions to set up most of your language change mechanism.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This guide requires the following nanoflow actions: 

* **Clear cached session data** – This action clears saved session data from the local storage for offline native app and PWAs. This nanoflow action is only compatible with Studio Pro v9.14 and above. Therefore, please use Studio Pro v9.14.0 or above.
* **Reload** – This action reloads web and native apps.

### 3.1 Adding the Module and Microflow

You can either add a new module to your existing app, or create a new Studio Pro app using a **Blank Native Mobile App** template and then adding a new module to it. Either way, your setup will begin with the same step and continue on accordingly:

1. Add a new module *ChangeLanguage* to your app.
1. Add a new microflow *ACT_Language_ChangeUserLangRuntime* to your **ChangeLanguage** module and configure it as such:
    1. Add a parameter called *LanguageCode* of data type `String`.
    1. Retrieve the language that was selected by the user on the app:
        1. This can be done by using a **Retrieve** object activity.
        1. Select the source as `Database` and entity `System.Language`.
        1. As you need only one language, select range as `First` and pass the XPath constraint as `[Code=$LanguageCode]`.
        1. Name this retrieved object *SelectedLanguage*.
        1. Your microflow should look like this:

            {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-language-change/microflow-retrieve-object.png"  alt="microflow retrieve object" width= "450" >}}

    1. To set the selected language, you need to change the language for the current user: 
        1. Call a **Change object** activity.
        1. Select the **Input** as `currentUser (System.User)`. 
        1. In the **Action** section, **Commit** should be set to `Yes` and **Refresh to client** set to `No`. 
        1. For **Member**, select `System.User_Language`.
        1. For the value of that member, set it as the object retrieved earlier: `$SelectedLanguage`.
        1. Your microflow should look like this:

            {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-language-change/microflow-language-change.png"  alt="microflow language change"  width= "500" >}}

Your microflow **ACT_Language_ChangeUserLangRuntime** is now ready to be called from a nanoflow which you will configure in the following section.

### 3.2 Adding the Nanoflow

Add a new nanoflow *ACT_Language_ChangeUserLangDevice* to your module and configure it like this:

1. Add a parameter called **SelectedLanguage** of data type `Object` and entity `System.Language`. This parameter will be the new app language as selected by the user.
1. Make a microflow call to **ACT_Language_ChangeUserLangRuntime**, the microflow you made previously.
1. In that microflow call, click **Edit parameter value**, select **Expression**, and write `$SelectedLanguage/Code` as the expression. This microflow call now sets the language as selected by the user.
1. Now the cached session needs to be cleared from local storage. Simply call a nanoflow action **Clear cached session data**.
1. To load the new language, you must refresh the app. This can be done by calling a nanoflow action **Reload**.
1. Your nanoflow should look like this:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-language-change/nanoflow-language-change.png"  alt="nanoflow language change" width= "500" >}}

### 3.3 Adding the Native Page

Add a new native page **Language_Overview** to your **ChangeLanguage** module, then do the following:

1. Add a title called *Select language*, as the selected language in Studio Pro is **English**. You can use a **Text** widget, but anything with a string value is fine.
1. Then underneath the title, add a native **List View** by simply dragging from the toolbox to list all the available languages on the app. Configure it this way:
    1. In the **Data source** tab, **Type** should be `Database`, **Entity** should be `System.Language`.
    1. In the **General** tab, **On click** should be configured to call a nanoflow **ACT_Language_ChangeUserLangDevice**.
    1. Click on the **OK** button.
        * You should get a dialog box asking **Do you want to automatically fill the contents of the list view?** Select `Yes`.
    1. **List View** should be populated with two fields: `{Code}` and `{Description}`. Delete the `{Code}` field.
1. Ensure the caption of the `{Description}` field in **ListView** is not empty. It should be mapped to the attribute `System.Language.Description` with the `{1}` variable and be used as well.
1. Change to the second language in Studio Pro by going to menu **Language** > **Current Language** > `<second_language>`.
1. Add a translation of the title in a second language if not available.
1. Ensure again that the caption of the `{Description}` field in **ListView** is not empty. It should be mapped to the attribute `System.Language.Description` and be used as well.
1. Repeat the above steps to add a translation for the third language as well.
1. Set **Language_Overview** as the default home page of the **Native mobile** navigation profile:
    1. Open **Navigation** in the App Explorer.
    1. Click the **Native mobile** tab.
    1. Set **Language_Overview** as the default home page.

## 4 Testing Language Switching {#testing}

Now it is time to see the app in action. If you are using a PWA, you can simply test in a web browser. 

To test your native app, locally deploy and view the app on the **Make It Native 9** app:

1. Follow the steps in [Downloading and Installing the Make It Native App](/refguide9/mobile/getting-started-with-mobile/#download-min) to view your app in Mendix's Make It Native testing app. 
1. Once the app is running, you should be able to see the native **Language_Overview** page:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-language-change/device-language-overview-en.png"  alt="language overview english" width= "250" >}}

1. To change the language, do the following:
    1. Tap **Dutch, Netherlands**.
    1. The app should be reloaded automatically.
    1. You should be able to see the title in the **Dutch** language:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-language-change/device-language-overview-nl.png"  alt="language overview dutch" width= "250" >}}

Congratulations, you just implemented internationalization in your native app! Your users will appreciate the power of multiple languages at their fingertips. For more information about languages and Mendix, see the Read More section below.
