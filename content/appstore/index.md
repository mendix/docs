## 1 Introduction

This guide presents documentation on configuring and using [platform-supported](/developerportal/app-store/app-store-content-support#category) App Store components.

For details on latest version of an App Store component, the Studio Pro version required for use, and when the component published, please see the component page in the Mendix App Store.

The Mendix community is encouraged to contribute components for use in the Mendix App Store, so be sure to review [How to Contribute to a Mendix GitHub Repository](/howto/collaboration-requirements-management/contribute-to-a-github-repository).
