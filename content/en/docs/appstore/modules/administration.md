## 3 Using the Administration Module with Mendix SSO

To use the Administration module with Mendix SSO, perform the following steps:

1. Follow the instructions to import the [Mendix SSO](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/111349) module into your app.

2. Make sure to either exclude or delete the microflows in the **MOVE_THIS** folder from the MendixSSO module.

3. Include the microflows with the prefix **MendixSSO_** in the **Mendix SSO** folder from the Administration module.

4. Configure the **MendixSSO_AfterStartup** microflow from the Administration module as the [after startup](/refguide/app-settings/#after-startup) microflow. If there is already an after startup microflow, do not replace it, but add the **MendixSSO_AfterStartup** microflow as a sub-microflow in the existing microflow.

{{% alert color="info" %}}If you previously used the Mendix SSO in your application, use the **MendixSSO_MigrateUsersToAccount** microflow to migrate users from the `MendixSSOUser` to the `Administration.Account` specialization. Before executing the migration, carefully read the instructions in the microflow.{{% /alert %}}
