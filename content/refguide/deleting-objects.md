### 3.1 Refresh in Client

If the microflow is called from the client, the deletion is not reflected in the client if **Refresh in client** is set to *No*. If set to *Yes*, the deletion is reflected across the client, which includes reloading relevant [data sources](data-sources).

Deletions are always reflected in the client. [Data sources](data-sources) are only reloaded if **Refresh in client** is set to *Yes*.
{{% /alert %}}
