## 1 Introduction 

Image [widgets](page-editor-widgets) are used to show images to the users. 

There are two image widgets in Mendix Studio:

* Image – allows you to show a static (non-changing) image in your app
*  Dynamic image – allows you to show a dynamic image (for example, a relevant profile picture that is different for each customer) in your app

   {{% /image_container %}}

{{% alert type="info" %}}

You can switch between static and dynamic image in widget's properties. For more information, see the [General Section](#image-general). 

{{% /alert %}} 

## 2 General Section {#image-general}

You can switch between static and dynamic image in the **General** section, as well as set the image itself, configure its width and height, etcetera. 

Before configuring settings in the **General** section for the **Dynamic Image**, keep in mind that it can only function inside a data container (a list view or a data view). You can either place widget in an existing data container; or click **Wrap with a new data view** in **Properties** to create a data view automatically and place an input element inside it.

{{% /image_container %}}

Settings available for **Static Image** and **Dynamic Image** are described in the table below:

| Property      | The property applies to   | Description                                                  |

| Entity        | Dynamic Image             | Specifies which entity will be shown in the dynamic image. You can only set an entity for the dynamic image if the entity has been configured as image in Studio Pro. For more information, see section [General Properties](/refguide/entities#entities-general-properties) in *Entities* in the *Studio Pro Guide* and [Dynamic Image (document template)](/refguide/dynamic-image-document-template) in the *Studio Pro Guide*. |

If you specify both width and height, the image will be scaled automatically: the proportions will be kept, the picture will not be stretched.</li><li>**Percentage** –  the width is specified in a percentage of the original width. It can be larger than its original width in which case the image is stretched.</li></ul><br />Default value for **Width Unit**: Auto |

## 3 Events Section 

You can choose the **On Click Action** in the **Events** section. The **On Click Action** defines what action is performed when the user clicks an image.

### 3.1 Common Properties

The static image and the dynamic image share the properties in the **Events** section, except for one property that is [specific for the dynamic image](#events-dynamic-image). 

For more information on the **Events** section for static and dynamic images, see [Events Section in Widgets](page-editor-widgets-events-section).

### 3.2 Dynamic Image Specific Property {#events-dynamic-image}

The dynamic image has a specific on-click action **Enlarge on Click**. The full-size image will be displayed when the user clicks it. This property overrides other on-click actions.
