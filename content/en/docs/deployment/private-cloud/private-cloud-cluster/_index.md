## Introduction

To allow you to manage the deployment of your apps to Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes, you first need to create a cluster and add at least one namespace in the Mendix Portal. This will provide you with the information you need to deploy the **Mendix Operator** and **Mendix Gateway Agent** in your OpenShift or Kubernetes context and create a link to the **Environments** pages of your Mendix app through the **Interactor**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/mx4pc-architecture.png" class="no-border" >}}

This document explains how to set up the cluster in Mendix.

Once you have created your namespace, you can invite additional team members who can then create or view environments in which their apps are deployed, depending on the rights you give them. For more information on the relationship between Mendix environments, Kubernetes namespaces, and Kubernetes clusters, see [Containerized Mendix App Architecture](#containerized-architecture), below.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You can also create clusters and namespaces using the [Mendix for Private Cloud Deploy API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/private-cloud-deploy-api/).

## Prerequisites for Creating a Cluster {#prerequisites}

To create a cluster in your OpenShift context, you need the following:

* A supported Kubernetes platform; for more information, see [Supported Versions](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-supported-environments/#supported-versions)
* An administration account for your OpenShift or Kubernetes platform
* **OpenShift CLI** installed (see [Getting started with the CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/cli_reference/getting-started-cli.html) on the Red Hat OpenShift website for more information) if you are creating clusters on OpenShift
* **Kubectl** installed if you are deploying to another Kubernetes platform (see [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) on the Kubernetes webside for more information)
* A command line terminal that supports the console API and mouse interactions. In Windows, this could be PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt. See [Terminal limitations](#terminal-limitations), below, for a more detailed explanation.

### Connected Environments {#prerequisites-connected}

Should you consider using a connected environment, the following URLs should be safelisted in your cluster's operating system, as these URLs point to services or resources required by the *Connected Environments'* infrastructure.

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `https://interactor-bridge.private-cloud.api.mendix.com` | Websocket based main communication API |
| `https://package-store-prod-2.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/` | Registry for downloading MDA artifacts |
| `https://private-cloud.registry.mendix.com` | Docker registry for downloading Runtime base images |
| `https://subscription-api.mendix.com` | Service to verify call-home license |

## Creating a Cluster and Namespace {#create-cluster-namespace}

### Creating a Cluster {#create-cluster}

1. Click [Cloud Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#cloud-settings) on the **Settings** page of your Mendix app.
2. Click **Mendix for Private Cloud**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image3.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Click **Set up Mendix for Private Cloud**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image4.png" class="no-border" >}}

4. Open the [Global Navigation menu](/developerportal/global-navigation/) and select **Deployment**.
5. Select **Mendix for Private Cloud** from the top menu bar in the Mendix Portal.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/cluster-manager.png" class="no-border" >}}

6. Click **Register Cluster**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image6.png" class="no-border" >}}

7. Enter the following information:

    * **Installation Type** – Choose **Global Installation** if you want a single Operator namespace to manage multiple namespaces, or **Namespace Installation** if you want the Operator to only manage one namespace. For more information, see [Global Operator](/developerportal/deploy/global-operator/).
    * **Cluster Name** – The name that you want to give the cluster which you are creating.
    * **Cluster Type** – Choose the correct type for your cluster. For more information, see [Supported Providers](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-supported-environments/).
    * **Description** – An optional description of the cluster which will be displayed under the cluster name in the Cluster Manager.

8. Click **Create**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/create-cluster.png" class="no-border" >}}

### Adding a Namespace for Connected Cluster {#add-namespace}

You now need to add a namespace to your cluster. Your cluster can contain several namespaces, see [Containerized Mendix App Architecture](#containerized-architecture), below for more information.

To add a namespace, do the following:

1. Click **Details** ({{% icon name="notes-paper-text" %}}) on the top right of the page:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/empty-cluster.png" class="no-border" >}}

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/ClusterDetails.png" class="no-border" >}}

2. Click **Add Namespace**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/namespace-details.PNG" class="no-border" >}}

3. Enter the following details:
    * **Namespace** – this is the namespace in your platform; this must conform to the namespace naming conventions of the cluster: all lower-case with hyphens allowed within the name
    * **Installation type** – if you want to create environments and deploy your app from the [Mendix Portal](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-deploy/), choose **Connected**, but if you only want to control your deployments through the Mendix Operator using the [CLI](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-operator/), choose **Standalone**

4. Click **Done** to create the namespace.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/add-namespace.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}} If you have selected a *Connected Installation Type* please verify that the [Connected Environment Pre-requisites](#prerequisites-connected) are configured. {{% /alert %}}

### Adding a Namespace for Stand-alone Cluster {#add-stand-alone-namespace}

If you would like to add a namespace to be added in the Stand-alone cluster, do the following:

1. Click **Details** ({{% icon name="notes-paper-text" %}}) on the top right of the page:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/empty-cluster.png" class="no-border" >}}

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/ClusterDetails.png" class="no-border" >}}

2. Click **Add Namespace**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/namespace-details-stand-alone.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Enter the following details:

    * **Namespace** – This is the namespace in your platform; this must conform to the namespace naming conventions of the cluster: all lower-case with hyphens allowed within the name.
    * **Installation type** – Choose **Standalone**.

4. Click **Next**.
5. Once you click on **Next**, you will be redirected to the Installation pop up page from where you can download the mxpc-cli and get the command to install the namespace in the cluster.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/stand-alone_downloadcli.png" class="no-border" >}}  

    For existing namespaces, if you would like to download the executables for mxpc-cli, you can go [here](https://privatecloud.mendixcloud.com/rest/internal/v1/mxpc-cli?operatorVersion=latest)

    In above page, once you do a JSON format, you will get the links for mxpc-cli for different available versions.

## Installing and Configuring the Mendix Operator {#install-operator}

You can install and run the Mendix Operator in either Global or Standard mode. In Global mode, the Operator is installed once for all available namespaces, whereas in Standard mode, it is installed separately for each namespace where a Mendix app is deployed. For more information, see:

* [Running the Mendix Operator in Global Mode](/developerportal/deploy/global-operator/)
* [Running the Mendix Operator in Standard Mode](/developerportal/deploy/standard-operator/)

### Licensing the Application with Private Cloud License Manager

You can license the Operator and Runtime of your application by configuring the Operator configuration with License Manager details. In order to start using Private Cloud License Manager, you need to first download the PCLM executable available in the Installation page. For more information, see [Private Cloud License Manager](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/private-cloud-license-manager/). The PCLM executable is available for download from this page.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/PCLMDownload.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In order to configure PCLM, make sure that the Operator version is 2.11.0 and above.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the context of the Global Operator, it is necessary to configure both the managed namespace and the Global Operator namespace with the License Manager details. For more information, see [Private Cloud License Manager](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/private-cloud-license-manager/).
{{% /alert %}}

## Advanced Operator Configuration

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Before updating the Operator with the advanced configurations, make sure to go through the [Introduction to Operators](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-technical-appendix-01/) which explains how Operators work in Mendix for Private Cloud.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
For Global Operator scenarios, if the Operator configuration in the managed namespace differs from the configuration in the Global Operator namespace, the configuration from the managed namespace will always take precedence.
{{% /alert %}}

Some advanced configuration options of the Mendix Operator are not yet available in the **Configuration Tool**.
These options can be changed by editing the `OperatorConfiguration` custom resource directly in Kubernetes.

Look at [Supported Providers](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-supported-environments/) to ensure that your planned configuration is supported by Mendix for Private Cloud.

To start editing the `OperatorConfiguration`, use the following commands (replace `{namespace}` with the namespace where the operator is installed):

For OpenShift:

```shell
oc -n {namespace} edit operatorconfiguration mendix-operator-configuration
```

For Kubernetes:

```shell
kubectl -n {namespace} edit operatorconfiguration mendix-operator-configuration
```

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Changing options which are not documented here can cause the Mendix Operator to configure environments incorrectly. Mendix recommends making a backup before applying any changes.
{{% /alert %}}

### Runtime Base Image

Starting from version 2.15.0, the OperatorConfiguration contains allows to specify the base OS image tag template.

The Operator will parse the MDA file metadata and use this metadata to fill in the `JavaVersion` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
# ...
# omitted lines for brevity
# ...
spec:
  baseOSImageTagTemplate: 'ubi8-1-jre{{.JavaVersion}}-entrypoint'
```

At the moment, the `baseOSImageTagTemplate` can be set to one of the following values:

* `ubi8-1-jre{{.JavaVersion}}-entrypoint` - to use Red Hat UBI 8 Micro images; this is the default option.
* `ubi9-1-jre{{.JavaVersion}}-entrypoint` - to use Red Hat UBI 9 Micro images; this option can be used to use a newer OS and improve security scores.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Future Studio Pro releases will have an option to use alternative (newer) LTS versions of Java, such as Java 17 or Java 21.

If an app's MDA was built using a newer Java version, Mendix Operator 2.15.0 (and newer versions) will detect this and use a base image with the same major Java version that was used to build the MDA.

### Endpoint (network) Configuration {#advanced-network-settings}

The OperatorConfiguration contains the following user-editable options for network configuration:

When using **Ingress** for network endpoints:

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
# ...
# omitted lines for brevity
# ...
spec:
  # Endpoint (Network) configuration
  endpoint:
    # Endpoint type: ingress, openshiftRoute or service
    type: ingress
    # Optional, can be omitted: Service annotations
    serviceAnnotations:
      # example: custom AWS CLB configuration
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: tcp
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:account:certificate/id
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "443"
    # Ingress configuration: used only when type is set to ingress
    ingress:
      # Optional, can be omitted: annotations which should be applied to all Ingress Resources
      annotations:
        # default annotation: allow uploads of files up 500 MB in the NGINX Ingress Controller
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 500m
        # example: use the specified cert-manager ClusterIssuer to generate TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt
        cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: staging-issuer
        # example: deny access to /rest-doc
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
          location /rest-doc {
            deny all;
            return 403;
          }
      # App URLs will be generated for subdomains of this domain, unless an app is using a custom appURL
      domain: mendix.example.com
      # Enable or disable TLS
      enableTLS: true
      # Optional: name of a kubernetes.io/tls secret containing the TLS certificate
      # This example is a template which lets cert-manager to generate a unique certificate for each app
      tlsSecretName: '{{.Name}}-tls'
      # Optional: specify the Ingress class name
      ingressClassName: alb
      # Optional, can be omitted : specify the Ingress path
      path: "/"
      # Optional, can be omitted : specify the Ingress pathType
      pathType: ImplementationSpecific
# ...
# omitted lines for brevity
# ...
```

When using **OpenShift Routes** for network endpoints:

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
spec:
  # Endpoint (Network) configuration
  endpoint:
    # Endpoint type: ingress, openshiftRoute, or service
    type: openshiftRoute
    # OpenShift Route configuration: used only when type is set to openshiftRoute
    openshiftRoute:
      # Optional, can be omitted: annotations which should be applied to all Ingress Resources
      annotations:
        # example: use HSTS headers
        haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;includeSubDomains;preload
      # Optional: App URLs will be generated for subdomains of this domain, unless an app is using a custom appURL
      domain: mendix.example.com
      # Enable or disable TLS
      enableTLS: true
      # Optional: name of a kubernetes.io/tls secret containing the TLS certificate
      # This example is the name of an existing secret, which should be a wildcard matching subdomains of the domain name
      tlsSecretName: 'mendixapps-tls'
```

When using **Services** for network endpoints (without an Ingress or OpenShift route):

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
spec:
  # Endpoint (Network) configuration
  endpoint:
    # Endpoint type: ingress, openshiftRoute, or service
    type: service
    # Optional, can be omitted: the Service type
    serviceType: LoadBalancer
    # Optional, can be omitted: Service annotations
    serviceAnnotations:
      # example: annotations required for AWS NLB
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: external
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: ip
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing
    # Optional, can be omitted: Service ports
    servicePorts:
      - 80
      - 443
```

You can change the following options:

* **type**: – select the Endpoint type, possible options are `ingress`, `openshiftRoute` and `service`; this parameter is also configured through the **Configuration Tool**
* **ingress**: - specify the Ingress configuration, required when **type** is set to `ingress`
* **openshiftRoute**: - specify the OpenShift Route configuration, required when **type** is set to `openshiftRoute`
* **annotations**: - optional, can be used to specify the Ingress or OpenShift Route annotations, can be a template: `{{.Name}}` will be replaced with the name of the CR for the Mendix app, and {{.Domain}} will be replaced with the application's domain name
* **serviceAnnotations**: - optional, can be used to specify the Service annotations, can be a template: `{{.Name}}` will be replaced with the name of the CR for the Mendix app, and {{.Domain}} will be replaced with the application's domain name
* **ingressClassName**: - optional, can be used to specify the Ingress Class name
* **path**: - optional, can be used to specify the Ingress path; default value is `/`
* **pathType**: - optional, can be used to specify the Ingress pathType; if not set, no pathType will be specified in Ingress objects
* **domain**: - optional for `openshiftRoute`, required for `ingress`, used to generate the app domain in case no app URL is specified; if left empty when using OpenShift Routes, the default OpenShift `apps` domain will be used; this parameter is also configured through the **Configuration Tool**
* **enableTLS**: - allows you to enable or disable TLS for the Mendix App's Ingress or OpenShift Route
* **tlsSecretName**: - optional name of a `kubernetes.io/tls` secret containing the TLS certificate, can be a template: `{{.Name}}` will be replaced with the name of the CR for the Mendix app; if left empty, the default TLS certificate from the Ingress Controller or OpenShift Router will be used
* **serviceType**: - can be used to specify the Service type, possible options are `ClusterIP` and `LoadBalancer`; if not specified, Services will be created with the `ClusterIP` type
* **servicePorts**: - can be used to specify a list of custom ports for the Service; if not specified, Services will use be created with port `8080`

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When switching between Ingress and OpenShift Routes, you need to [restart the Mendix Operator](#restart-after-changing-network-cr) for the changes to be fully applied.
{{% /alert %}}

### Mendix App Deployment settings {#advanced-deployment-settings}

The OperatorConfiguration contains the following user-editable options for configuring Mendix app Deployments (Pods):

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
spec:
  # Optional: provide Mendix app Pods to get a Kubernetes Service Account token
  runtimeAutomountServiceAccountToken: true
  # Optional: annotations for Mendix app Pods
  runtimeDeploymentPodAnnotations:
    # example: inject the Linkerd proxy sidecar
    linkerd.io/inject: enabled
    # example: enable Prometheus metrics scraping
    prometheus.io/path: /metrics
    prometheus.io/port: '8900'
    prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
```

You can change the following options:

* **runtimeAutomountServiceAccountToken**: – specify if Mendix app Pods should get a Kubernetes Service Account token; defaults to `false`; should be set to `true` when using Linkerd [Automatic Proxy Injection](https://linkerd.io/2.10/features/proxy-injection/)
* **runtimeDeploymentPodAnnotations**: – specify default annotations for Mendix app Pods

### Mendix App Resource Customization {#advanced-resource-customization}

The Deployment object that controls the pod of a given Mendix application contains user-editable options for fine-tuning the execution to the application's runtime resources.

The Deployment object as a name in the following format:

```shell
<internal environment name>-master
```

Below is an example of the Deployment definition of an app. In this example, the Deployment definition is called `b8nn6lq5-master`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1

#### Resource Definition via Operator Configuration Manifest {#resource-definition-ocm}

For a given namespace, all the resource information is aggregated in the `mendix-operator-configuration` manifest. This centralizes and overrides all the configuration explained above. For an example of the Operator configuration manifest, see below. Note that the below configuration is just for reference purpose.

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
# ...
# omitted lines for brevity
# ...
spec:
  sidecarResources:
    limits:
      cpu: 250m
      memory: 32Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 16Mi
  metricsSidecarResources:
    limits:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 32Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 16Mi
  buildResources:
    limits:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: 256Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 250m
      memory: 64Mi
  runtimeResources:
    limits:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 512Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 512Mi
  runtimeLivenessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 60
    periodSeconds: 15
  runtimeReadinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 1
  # startup probes are deprecated in Mendix Operator 2.15.0
  runtimeStartupProbe:
    failureThreshold: 30
    periodSeconds: 10
  runtimeTerminationGracePeriodSeconds: 300
```

The following fields can be configured:

* `liveness`, `readiness`, and `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` – these are used for all Mendix app deployments in the namespace; any changes made in the deployments will be discarded and overwritten with values from the `OperatorConfiguration` resource
* `sidecarResources` – this is used for all `m2ee-sidecar` containers in the namespace
* `metricsSidecarResources` – this is used for all `m2ee-metrics` containers in the namespace
* `runtimeResources` – this is used for `mendix-runtime` containers in the namespace (but this is overwritten if the Mendix app CRD has a resources block)
* `buildResources` – this is used for the main container in `*-build` pods

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Mendix Operator 2.15.0 uses an improved liveness probe that runs a healthcheck of the Mendix Runtime.

As soon as the Mendix Runtime begins the startup process, the liveness check will return a valid response - as long as the Mendix Runtime is starting and passes its internal healthchecks.

The liveness probe will begin returning valid responses just a few seconds after the Runtime container starts, and this removes the need to use startup probes.
Starting from Mendix Operator 2.15.0, startup probes are no longer used, and changing their settings will have no effect.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Starting from Mendix Operator 2.17.0, the liveness probe health check depends on the [runtime_status](/refguide/monitoring-mendix-runtime/#runtime-status) command to check if an app is running (starting or started) and in a healthy state.

If a [check_health](/refguide/monitoring-mendix-runtime/#check-health) microflow is configured, its status will also be validated.

An app will return a successful health check status if all of these conditions are true:

1. The Runtime replies to `ping` calls (any reply is accepted).
    Mendix Operator versions 2.15 and 2.16 assumed an invalid `ping` reply to be an error, and failed the liveness probe. The Mendix Runtime will return a fail reply to `ping` calls if at any point a message was logged with a **critical** log level (which is [reserved for errors that require immediate attention](/refguide/logging/#critical), and that caused some apps to restart when running in Operator 2.15 or 2.16. Mendix Operator 2.17 ignores the `ping` reply and will no longer restart apps that have logged a **critical** log message.
2. The Runtime's status is `created`, `starting`, `running` or `stopping`.
3. If the Runtime is `running`, and a healthcheck microflow is configured, the healthcheck microflow needs to return a `healthy` state. If there is no `check_health` microflow configured, or the Runtime's state is not `running`, this condition is ignored.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Customize Liveness Probe to Resolve Crash Loopback Scenarios

The `liveness probe` informs the cluster whether the pod is dead or alive. If the pod fails to respond to the liveness probe, the pod will be restarted (this is called a `crash loopback`).

The `readiness probe`, on the other hand, is designed to check if the cluster is allowed to send network traffic to the pod. If the pod fails this probe, requests will no longer be sent to the pod.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The configuration of the **Readiness probe** does not help to resolve *crash loopback* scenarios. In fact increasing its parameters might degrade the performance of your app, since any malfunction or error recovery will take longer to be acknowledged by the cluster.
{{% /alert %}}

Let us now analyze the `liveness probe` section from the application deployment example, above:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 3
  httpGet:
    path: /m2ee-sidecar/v1/healthz
    port: 8800
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 60
  periodSeconds: 15
  successThreshold: 1
  timeoutSeconds: 1
```

The following fields can be configured:

* `initialDelaySeconds` – the number of seconds after the container has started that the probe is initiated. Minimum value is 0.
* `periodSeconds` – how often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default is 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1.
* `timeoutSeconds` – the number of seconds after which the probe times out. Default is 3 second. Minimum value is 1.
* `successThreshold` – the number of consecutive successes required before the probe is considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup Probes. Minimum value is 1.
* `failureThreshold` – the number of times Kubernetes will retry when a probe fails before giving up. Giving up in case of a liveness probe means restarting the container. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If we are deploying a large application that takes much longer to start than the defined 60 seconds, we will observe it restarting multiple times. To solve this scenario we must edit field `initialDelaySeconds` for the **Liveness probe** to a substantially larger value.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Mendix Operator 2.15.0 uses an improved liveness probe that runs a healthcheck of the Mendix Runtime.

The default settings for the liveness probe should work for almost every use case, and should not be modified unless instructed by Mendix Support.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Customize Startup Probes for Slow Starting Applications

If you want to wait before executing a liveness probe you should use `initialDelaySeconds` or a startup probe.

A startup probe should be used when the application in your container could take a significant amount of time to reach its normal operating state. Applications that would crash or throw an error if they handled a liveness or readiness probe during startup need to be protected by a startup probe. This ensures the container doesn't continually restart due to failing health checks before it has finished launching. Using a startup probe is much better than increasing `initialDelaySeconds` on readiness or liveness probes. Startup probes defer the execution of liveness and readiness probes until a container indicates it is able to handle them because Kubernetes doesn't direct the other probe types to the container if it has a startup probe that hasn't yet succeeded.

You can see an example of a startup probe configuration below:

```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: mendix-app
    scheme: HTTP
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

In this example, the application will have a maximum of 5 minutes (30 * 10 = 300s) to finish its startup. Once the startup probe has succeeded once, the liveness probe takes over to provide a fast response to container deadlocks. If the startup probe never succeeds, the container is killed after 300s and subject to the pod's [restartPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you misconfigure a startup probe, for example you don't allow enough time for the startup probe to succeed, the kubelet might restart the container prematurely. causing your container to continually restart.

Startup probes are available in the Mendix for Private Cloud Operator version 2.6.0 and above.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
In Kubernetes version 1.19, startup probes are still a [beta feature](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/21/moving-forward-from-beta/).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Mendix Operator 2.15.0 uses an improved liveness probe that runs a healthcheck of the Mendix Runtime.

Startup probes are no longer used, and changing the `startupProbe` settings will have no effect.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Customize terminationGracePeriodSeconds for Gracefully Shutting Down the Application Pod

Using `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, the application is given a certain amount of time to terminate. The default value is 300 seconds. This time can be configured using the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` key in the pod's spec and so if your pod usually takes longer than 300 seconds to shut down, you can increase the grace period. You can do that by setting the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` key in the pod YAML.

```yaml
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 300
```

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` setting is available in the Mendix for Private Cloud Operator version 2.6.0 and above.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Customize Container Resources: Memory and CPU

The `resources` following section shows an example configuration of the `resources` section from the example application deployment, above. Note that the configuration is just for reference purpose.

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 1
    memory: 512Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 512Mi
```

This section allows the configuration of the lower and upper resource boundaries, the `requests` and `limits` respectively.

The settings in the example above mean that

* the container will always receive at least the resources set in `requests`
* if the server node where a pod is running has enough of a given resource available the container can be granted resource than its `requests`
* a container will never be granted more than its resource `limits`

##### Meaning of CPU

Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in cpu units. One CPU, in this context, is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors.

Fractional requests are allowed. For instance, in this example, we are requesting `100m`, which can be read as *one hundred millicpu*, and limiting to a maximum of `1` CPU (1000m).

A precision finer than 1m is not allowed.

##### Meaning of Memory

Limits and requests for memory are measured in bytes. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, K. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki. For example, the following represent roughly the same value: `128974848`, `129e6`, `129M`, `123Mi`

For instance, in the example above, we are requesting and limiting memory usage to roughly **512MiB**.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Modifying the resource configuration should be performed carefully as that might have direct implications on the performance of your application, and the resource usage of the server node.
{{% /alert %}}

### Customize Runtime Metrics {#customize-runtime-metrics}

Mendix for Private Cloud provides a Prometheus API, which can be used to collect metrics from Mendix apps.

`runtimeMetricsConfiguration` allows you to specify the default metrics configuration for a namespace.
Any configuration values from `runtimeMetricsConfiguration` can be overridden for an environment using the `MendixApp` CR (see [Generating Metrics](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-monitor/#generating) for more details).

An example of the `runtimeMetricsConfiguration` in the operator configuration manifest is given below.

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
    # …
spec:
  runtimeMetricsConfiguration:
    mode: native
    interval: "PT1M"
    mxAgentConfig: |-
      {
        "requestHandlers": [
          {
            "name": "*"
          }
        ],
        "microflows": [
          {
            "name": "*"
          }
        ],
        "activities": [
          {
            "name": "*"
          }
        ]
      }
    mxAgentInstrumentationConfig: |-
      {
        …
      }
  # …
```

You can set the following metrics configuration values:

* `mode`: metrics mode, `native` or `compatibility`. `native` mode is only available for Mendix 9.7 and above. See [Metrics Generation Modes](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-monitor/#metrics-generation-modes) in *Monitoring Environments in Mendix for Private Cloud* for more information.
* `interval`: Interval between Prometheus scrapes specified in ISO 8601 duration format (for example, 'PT1M' would be an interval of one minute). This should be aligned with your Prometheus configuration. If left empty it defaults to 1 minute (matching the default Prometheus scrape interval). This attribute is only applicable when `mode` is `native`.
* `mxAgentConfig`: configuration for the [Java instrumentation agent](https://github.com/mendix/mx-agent); collects additional metrics such as microflow execution times; can be left empty to disable the instrumentation agent. This attribute is only applicable when `mode` is `native`.
* `mxAgentInstrumentationConfig`: instrumentation configuration for the [Java instrumentation agent](https://github.com/mendix/mx-agent); collects additional metrics such as microflow execution times; can be left empty to use the default instrumentation config. This attribute is only applicable when `mode` is `native`, and `mxAgentConfig` is not empty.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
MxAgent is a [Java instrumentation agent](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.instrument/java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation.html) and is unrelated to the Mendix for Private Cloud Gateway Agent.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
To disable the Prometheus metrics API, remove the `runtimeMetricsConfiguration` section or set `mode` to an empty string.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information about collecting metrics in Mendix for Private Cloud, see [Monitoring Environments in Mendix for Private Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-monitor/).

### Customize Service Account {#customize-service-account}

The Mendix environment can be configured to use a specific Kubernetes ServiceAccount instead of the default ServiceAccount.

To achieve this, you need to add the annotation `privatecloud.mendix.com/environment-account: true` (for security reasons, any account matching an environment name but without this annotation cannot be attached to environments).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The service account can be customized for Private Cloud Operator version 2.7.0 and above.
{{% /alert %}}

If required, you can use additional annotations. For example, in order to authenticate with AWS services instead of with static credentials, you can attach an AWS IAM role to an environment and use [IRSA](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-service-accounts/).

### Autoscaling

Mendix for Private Cloud is compatible with multiple types of Kubernetes autoscalers.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
To optimize resource utilization, autoscaling can terminate running instances of an app.

When autoscaling scales down an app or Kubernetes node, microflows in affected pods will be terminated, and the terminating pod will no longer accept new HTTP connections.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Cluster Autoscaling

The Kubernetes [cluster autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) monitors resource usage and automatically adjusts the size of the cluster based on its resource needs.

Mendix for Private Cloud is compatible with cluster autoscaling. To install and enable cluster autoscaling, follow your cluster vendor's recommended way of configuring the cluster autoscaler.

#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling {#horizontal-autoscaling}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You need to have the Mendix Operator version 2.4.0 or above installed in your namespace to use horizontal pod autoscaling.
{{% /alert %}}

[Horizontal pod autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) is a standard Kubernetes feature
and can automatically add or remove pods based on metrics, such as average CPU usage.

Enabling horizontal pod autoscaling allows you to increase processing capacity during peak loads and reduce resource usage during periods of low activity.
Horizontal pod autoscaling can be combined with cluster autoscaling, so that the cluster and environment are automatically optimized for the current workload.

To enable horizontal pod autoscaling for an environment, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl -n {namespace} autoscale mendixapp {envname} --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
```

Replace `{namespace}` with the namespace name, and `{envname}` with the MendixApp CR name (the environment internal name).
Use `--cpu-percent` to specify the target CPU usage, and `--min` `--max` to specify minimum and maximum number of replicas.

To configure additional horizontal pod autoscaling, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl -n {namespace} edit horizontalpodautoscaler {envname}
```

Replace `{namespace}` with the namespace name, and `{envname}` with the MendixApp CR name (the environment internal name).
The Kubernetes [Horizontal pod autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) documentation explains additional available autoscaling options.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The Mendix Runtime is based on Java, which pre-allocates memory and typically never releases it.
Memory-based metrics should not be used for autoscaling.
{{% /alert %}}

When an environment is scaled (manually or automatically), it will not be restarted. Adjusting the number of replicas will not cause downtime - as long as the number of replicas is greater than zero.
Scaling an environment up (increasing the number of replicas) adds more pods - without restarting any already running pods; once the additional pods become available, they will start receiving HTTP (or HTTPS) requests.
Scaling an environment down (decreasing the number of replicas) removes some of the running pods - without restarting remaining pods; all HTTP (or HTTPS) traffic will be routed to the remaining pods.

#### Vertical Pod Autoscaling {#vertical-pod-autoscaling}

[Vertical pod autoscaling](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) can automatically configure CPU and memory resources and requirements for a pod.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The Mendix Runtime is based on Java, which pre-allocates memory and typically never releases it.
Memory-based metrics should not be used for autoscaling.
{{% /alert %}}

Mendix Operator version 2.4.0 or above has the APIs required by the vertical pod autoscaler.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Vertical pod autoscaling is still an experimental, optional Kubernetes add-on.

Mendix recommends using horizontal pod autoscaling to adjust environments to meet demand.

Vertical pod autoscaling cannot be combined with horizontal pod autoscaling.
{{% /alert %}}

### Log format

#### Runtime log format{#runtime-log-format}

Mendix Operator version 2.11.0 or above allows you to specify the log format used by Mendix apps.

To specify the log format, add a `runtimeLogFormatType` entry to `OperatorConfiguration`:

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
spec:
  # ...
  # Other configuration options values
  # Optional: log format type
  runtimeLogFormatType: json
```

You can set `runtimeLogFormatType` to one of the following values:

* **plain**: – default option, produces plaintext logs in the following format:

    ```
    2023-03-21 14:36:14.607 INFO - M2EE: Added admin request handler '/prometheus' with servlet class 'com.mendix.metrics.prometheus.PrometheusServlet'
    ```

* **json**: – produces JSON logs in the following format:

    ```json
    {"node":"M2EE","level":"INFO","message":"Added admin request handler '/prometheus' with servlet class 'com.mendix.metrics.prometheus.PrometheusServlet'","timestamp":1679409374607}
    ```

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
In the `json` format, newline characters will be sent as `\n` (as specified in the [JSON spec](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)). You might need to configure your log viewer tool to display `\n` as line breaks.
For example, to correctly display newline characters in Grafana, use the [Escape newlines](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/31352) button.
{{% /alert %}}

### Pod labels {#pod-labels}

#### General pod labels

Mendix Operator version 2.13.0 or above allows you to specify default pod labels for app-related pods: task pods (build and storage provisioners) and runtime (app) pods.

To specify default pod labels for a namespace, specify them in `customPodLabels.general` in `OperatorConfiguration`:

```yaml
apiVersion: privatecloud.mendix.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperatorConfiguration
spec:
  # ...
  # Other configuration options values
  # Optional: custom pod labels
  customPodLabels:
    # Optional: general pod labels (applied to all app-related pods)
    general:
      # Example: enable Azure Workload Identity
      azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
```

Alternatively, for Stand-alone clusters, pod labels can be specified in the `MendixApp` CR for a specific app.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The Mendix Operator uses some labels for internal use. To avoid conflicts with these internal pod labels, please avoid using labels starting with the `privatecloud.mendix.com/` prefix.
{{% /alert %}}

### GKE Autopilot Workarounds {#gke-autopilot-workarounds}

In GKE Autopilot, one of the key features is its ability to automatically adjust resource settings based on the observed resource utilization of the containers. GKE Autopilot verifies the resource allocations and limits for all containers, and makes adjustments to deployments when the resources are not as per its requirements.

As a result, there can be a continuous back-and-forth interaction between Mx4PC and GKE Autopilot, where both entities engage in a loop, attempting to counteract each other's modifications to deployments and pods.

To address this issue, you can configure the Mendix Operator to align with GKE's requirements. This involves setting the resources (specifically, the CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage) to be equal to the limits defined in the `OperatorConfiguration` for both the `sidecar` and `metrics-sidecar` containers. Along with this, you must ensure that the resource limits for the CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage are equal to the resource requests in the Private Cloud Portal. For more information on setting the core resources on the Portal, see [Custom Core Resource Plan](#custom-core-resource-plan).

You must also create a patch file for configuring the core resources in the `OperatorConfiguration`, as in the following example:

```yaml
spec:
  buildResources:
    limits:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: 256Mi
    requests:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: 256Mi
  metricsSidecarResources:
    limits:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 32Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 32Mi
```

Run the following command in order to update the core resources in the `OperatorConfiguration`:

```shell
kubectl -n {namespace} patch OperatorConfiguration mendix-operator-configuration --type merge -p "$(cat <patchedFile>)"
```

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) requires a balanced allocation of CPU and memory resources. If a container requests a substantial amount of memory, it should also correspondingly request more CPU cores. For detailed information on resource requests, you can refer to the [Resource Requests in Autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-resource-requests) documentation provided by Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Cluster and Namespace Management

Once it is configured, you can manage your cluster and namespaces through the Mendix Portal.

### Cluster Overview {#overview}

Go to the Cluster Manager page by clicking **Cluster Manager** in the top menu of the **Clouds** page of the Mendix Portal.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/cluster-manager.png" class="no-border" >}}

From this page you can see a summary of your clusters with all their namespaces and an indication of the namespace status and how long it has been running (runtime).

#### Managing the Cluster

Here you can perform the following actions on the entire cluster:

* Delete the cluster by clicking **Delete** ({{% icon name="trash-can" %}})
* Rename the cluster or edit its description by clicking **Edit** ({{% icon name="pencil" %}})
* Invite another cluster manager

<a id="actvity-logs"></a>You can also see the activities logged for all you clusters by clicking **Activity** in the [cluster overview](#overview) page. This shows the following:

* When a cluster has been added
* When a cluster description is added
* When name of the cluster is changed
* When cluster description is changed

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/cluster-activity-logs.PNG" class="no-border" >}}

If you prefer the individual to join as a cluster manager automatically, without requiring them to manually accept the invitation, you can enable the **Automatically accept invites** option.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/AutoAcceptClusterManager.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The **Automatically accept invites** option is applicable only when the invited users have the same email domain as yours.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When you add a cluster manager, the user will have most of the access which the original cluster manager had, such as the abilities to add a namespace, add a member, change the permissions of the cluster member, and delete another cluster manager.

The only limitations are that:

* An added cluster manager will not be able to operate on or manage the environments created in the namespaces which are already in the cluster — they need to be added as a member of the application if they want to manage existing environments in the namespaces.
* Cluster managers who are added to the cluster cannot remove the cluster manager who created the cluster.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When you delete a cluster, this removes the cluster from the Mendix Portal. However, it will not remove the associated namespace from your platform. You will need to explicitly delete the namespace using the tools provided by your platform.
{{% /alert %}}

### Namespace Management

If you are a member of a namespace, you can also manage a namespace in the cluster.

Click the **Details** button for the namespace you want to manage.

On the namespace management page, there are a number of tabs which allow you to manage aspects of your namespace :

* Apps
* Members
* Operate
* Plans
* Installation
* Additional information
* Customization
* PCLM Statistics

See the sections below for more information.

You can also delete your namespace from the cluster manager by clicking **Delete Namespace** ({{% icon name="trash-can" %}}) in the top right.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image25.png" class="no-border" >}}

If there are any environments associated with the namespace, you cannot delete the namespace until the environments associated with it are deleted.

When you delete a namespace, this removes the namespace from the cluster in the Mendix Portal. However, it will not remove the namespace from your platform. You will need to explicitly delete the namespace using the tools provided by your platform.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image26.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the case of a Global Operator managed namespace, the managed namespace will not be deleted from the cluster. You must delete it from the cluster manually. Additionally, you also need to remove the managed namespace from the list of managed namespaces in the Operator configuration of the main namespace. 
{{% /alert %}}

In order to delete the namespace from the cluster, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that all the environments under this namespaces are removed. You can check the list of environments under this namespace using the following command:

    For OpenShift:

    ```shell
    oc -n {namespace} get mendixapp
    ```

    For Kubernetes:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n {namespace} get mendixapp
    ```

2. If any Mendix apps still exist in the namespace, you can delete them by using the following command, where *internalId* is the ID of the environment:

    For OpenShift:

    ```shell
    oc -n {namespace} delete mendixapp {internalId}
    ```

    For Kubernetes:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n {namespace} delete mendixapp {internalId}
    ```

3. Wait until the storage provisioner completes the process of deleting the storage instance related to the environment. You can check if there are any existing storage instances by running the following command:

    For OpenShift:

    ```shell
    oc -n {namespace} get storageinstance
    ```

    For Kubernetes:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n {namespace} get storageinstance
    ```

4. If there are any failed storage instances, you can check their logs by running the following command:

    For OpenShift:

    ```shell
    oc -n {namespace} log {storageinstance-name}
    ```

    For Kubernetes:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n {namespace} log {storageinstance-name}
    ```

5. If there are any remaining storage instances, you can delete then by using the following command:

    For OpenShift:

    ```shell
    oc patch -n {namespace} storageinstance {name} --type json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
    ```

    For Kubernetes:

    ```shell
    kubectl patch -n {namespace} storageinstance {name} --type json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
    ```

6. After manually removing the storage instance, manually clean up any resources associated with it, such as the database, S3 bucket or associated AWS IAM account in the cluster.

7. Once all the storage instances are deleted successfully, yon can now delete the namespace from the cluster by using the following command:

    ```shell
    oc delete ns {namespace}
    ```

    For Kubernetes:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete ns {namespace}
    ```

You can also see an activity log containing the following information for all namespaces within the cluster:

* When a namespace has been added
* When a namespace has been deleted
* When a cluster manager has been added
* When a cluster manager invitation is removed
* When a cluster manager accepts the invitation
* When a cluster manager is removed from the cluster
* When a new database plan is added in a namespace
* When a database plan is deactivated
* When a new storage plan is added in a namespace
* When a storage plan is deactivated
* When Metrics/Alerts/Logs/Backups URLs are added in the namespace
* When Metrics/Alerts/Logs/Backups URLs are removed from the namespace
* When Metrics/Alerts/Logs/Backups URLs are changed in the namespace
* When a user is invited as a namespace member
* When a user invitation for namespace member is removed
* When a user accepts the invitation as a namespace member
* When a user is removed as a namespace member
* When user's permission is changed in the namespace
* When environment configurations are added, updated, or removed
* When Runtime Metrics configurations are added, updated, or deleted
* When developer mode is enabled in the namespace
* When developer mode is disabled in the namespace

#### Apps

The **Apps** tab of namespace details in the cluster manager page lists all the app environments which are deployed to this namespace.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image27.png" class="no-border" >}}

If you are a team member of the app, click **Details** to go to the *Environment Details* page for that app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You can only see the environment details of an app if you are a member of the team with the appropriate authorization.
{{% /alert %}}

If you are a cluster administrator, you can also click **Configure** to configure the environment by adding annotations for pods, ingress, and service.

##### Configure Environment

You can add, edit, and delete annotations for your environment.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You need to have the Mendix Operator version 1.12.0 or above installed in your namespace to configure all the available annotations. You need version 1.11.0 to use pod annotations.
{{% /alert %}}

To add a new annotation, do the following.

1. Click **Add**.
2. Choose the **Annotation type** from the dropdown.
3. Enter the **Key** and the **Value** for the annotation.
4. Click **Save**.

You can also **Edit** or **Delete** an existing annotation by selecting it and clicking the appropriate button.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The new value for the annotation will only be applied when the application is restarted.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Mendix Operator version 2.14.0 (and older) don't remove ingress or service annotations when an annotation is removed from the Private Cloud Portal or in the `MendixApp` CR.

This is addressed in Mendix Operator version 2.15.0; if you need to remove an ingress or service annotation, please upgrade to the latest Mendix Operator version first.
{{% /alert %}}

You can configure the runtime metrics for the environment in the **Runtime** section. For more information, see [Customize Runtime Metrics](#customize-runtime-metrics).

You can also configure the pod labels for the environment in the **Labels** section. For more information, see [App Pod Labels](#pod-labels).

#### Members

By default, the cluster manager, who created the cluster in Mendix, and anyone added as a cluster manager has full administration rights to the cluster and its namespaces. These cluster managers will also need to be given the appropriate permissions on the Kubernetes or OpenShift Cluster. The administration rights are:

* Add and delete namespaces
* Add, activate, or deactivate plans
* Invite and manage users

The following rights are available to the cluster creator, and members of a namespace with appropriate authorization:

* Set up operating URLs for the namespace
* View all environments in the namespace
* Manage own environments – user can create and manage an environment in any namespace in the cluster

The following actions require the appropriate access to the namespace **and** access to the app environment as a team member with appropriate authorization:

* Manage environment- user can navigate to the environment details section and edit the environment name and core resources
* Deploy App – user can deploy a new app to the environment
* Scale App – user can change the number of replicas
* Start App
* Stop App
* Modify MxAdmin Password
* Edit App Constants
* Manage App Scheduled Events
* View App Logs
* View App Alerts
* View App Metrics
* Manage App Backups
* Manage Debugger
* Manage TLS configurations
* Manage Custom Runtime Settings
* Manage Log levels
* Manage Client Certificates
* Manage Custom Environment Variables and JVM options
* Manage Runtime Metrics Configuration

The **Members** tab allows you to manage the list of members of the namespace and control what rights they have.

##### Adding Members

You can invite additional members to the namespace, and configure their role depending on what they should be allowed to do.

1. The **Members** tab displays a list of current members (if any).
2. Click **Invite Member**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image28.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Enter the **Email** of the person you want to invite.
4. If you prefer the individual to join as a namespace member automatically, without requiring them to manually accept the invitation, you can enable the **Automatically accept invites** option.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}The **Automatically accept invites** option is applicable only when the invited users have the same email domain as yours.{{% /alert %}}

5. Give them the rights they need. This can be:

    1. **Developer** – a standard set of rights needed by a developer, these are listed on the screen
    2. **Administrator** – a standard set of rights needed by an administrator, these are listed on the screen
    3. **Custom** – you can select a custom set of rights by checking the box next to each role you want to give to this person

    With custom permissions, we have now decoupled the permissions for Scale, Start and Stop operations. If an application is in the Stopped state, the scaling does not come into effect until the application is Started. This means that you have to click **Start application** in order for the changes to be sent to the cluster.
    Along with this, we have also decoupled the permission for modifying the MxAdmin password and managing environments.

6. Click **Send Invite** to send an invite to this person.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/AutoAcceptInvite.png" class="no-border" >}}

7. If you have not enabled the **Automatically accept invites** option, the user will receive an email and will be required to follow a link to confirm that they want to join this namespace. They will need to be logged in to Mendix when they follow the confirmation link.

##### Editing and Removing Members

You can change the access rights for, or completely remove, existing members.

1. Click **Edit** next to the member you want to change.
2. Either:

    1. Make changes and click **Save**.
    2. Click **Remove member** to remove this member completely. You will be asked to confirm this action.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image30.png" class="no-border" >}}

#### Operate {#operate}

The **Operate** tab allows you to add a set of links which are used when users request an operations page for their app in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/).
The following pages can be configured:

* Metrics
* Alerts
* Logs
* Backups

The specification of these pages is optional.

Open the **Operate** tab, enter the URLs relevant to your namespace, and click **Save** for each one.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image32.png" class="no-border" >}}

#### Plans

The **Plans** tab shows you the database and storage plans which are currently configured for your namespace.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image33.png" class="no-border" >}}

##### Deactivating a Plan

Enable the toggle button next to the name of the plan you wish to deactivate. You cannot remove plans from within the cluster manager, but you can deactivate them to ensure that developers cannot create environments using the plan. Any environments currently using the plan will not be affected by this setting.

##### Activating a Plan

Disable the toggle button next to the name of the plan you wish to activate. The plan can then be used by developers when they create an environment to deploy their apps.

##### Deleting a Plan

You can only delete storage or database plans if they are not used in any of your environments, regardless of whether they are active or inactive.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
After you delete a plan, the action cannot be reverted or undone through the portal. Deleting the plan does not remove it from the cluster. To delete the plan from the cluster, a separate action is required, which can be accomplished by executing the following command:

For OpenShift:

```shell
oc -n {namespace} get storageplan
oc -n {namespace} delete storageplan {StoragePlanName}
```

For Kubernetes:

```shell
kubectl -n {namespace} get storageplan
kubectl -n {namespace} delete storageplan {StoragePlanName}
```

{{% /alert %}}

#### Custom Core Resource Plan {#custom-core-resource-plan}

Here, you can create customized plan for your core resources.

1. Click **Add New Plan**.
2. Provide a name to the plan under **Plan Name**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/customPlan.png" class="no-border" >}}

3. Provide the required **CPU Limits**, **CPU Request**, **Memory Limit**, **Memory Request**, **Ephemeral Storage Request** and **Ephemeral Storage Limit** based on your choice.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/customPlanDetails.png" class="no-border" >}}.

4. Click **OK** button to save the customized resource plan.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/savedCustomPlan.png" class="no-border" >}}

5. In order to make the customized plan available to the customer, make sure to enable the toggle button next **Use custom core resources plans**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/customPlanEnable.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Ephemeral Storage is a temporary storage attached to the lifecycle of a pod. Hence, with the deletion of pod, the data stored in the ephemeral storage is also lost.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Once you enable the **Use custom core resources plans** button, you cannot switch back to the default core plans until you delete all the environments using the custom core plans and disable **Use custom core resources plans** button. A warning message with the same information is displayed when trying to enable this feature.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Installation

The **Installation** tab shows you the Configuration Tool which you used to create the namespace, together with the parameters which are used to configure the agent. You can use the Configuration Tool again to change the configuration of your namespace by pasting the command into a command line terminal as described in [Running the Configuration Tool](/developerportal/deploy/standard-operator/#running-the-tool), above. You can also download the Configuration Tool again, if you wish.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In case of Global Operator Managed namespace, you will see the Configuration tab instead of the Installation tab. For more information, see [Global Operator Namespace](/developerportal/deploy/global-operator/)
{{% /alert %}}

#### Additional Information

This tab shows information on the versions of the various components installed in your namespace.

#### Customization

This tab allows the cluster manager to customize the enablement of the secret store, developer mode for the developers, and product type for the PCLM Runtime License.

Enabling the **External Secrets Store** option allows users to retrieve the following secrets from an external secrets store:

* Database plan
* Storage plan
* MxAdmin password
* Custom runtime settings
* MxApp constants

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you want to use the secret store for custom runtime settings or MxApp constants, the Mendix Operator must be in version 2.10.0 or later. Database plan, storage plan, and MxAdmin password are available from version 2.9.0 onwards.
{{% /alert %}}

Enabling the Development Mode option will allow users to change the type of an environment to Development.

If PCLM is configured, the default product type for Runtime licenses is set to **standard**. However, if the product type for PCLM Runtime licenses in the license server differs from **Standard**, you can customize it here. To check the product type of the Runtime license, navigate to the **PCLM Statistics** page, and then select **Runtime** in the **Select type** field.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The product type value to be entered is case-sensitive. Ensure that the value matches exactly with the product type of the Runtime license on the **PCLM Statistics** page.
{{% /alert %}}

The selected product type will be applied to all environments within this namespace, and associated environments will adopt the license of this specific product type.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/Customization.png" class="no-border" >}}

#### PCLM Statistics

This tab shows information about claimed licenses, operator licenses and runtime licenses.

Select **Claim** to view a list of licenses from the license bundle which are claimed in the namespace.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/LicenseClaim.png" class="no-border" >}}

Select **Operator** to view a list of all the Operator licenses in the bundle.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/OperatorList.png" class="no-border" >}}

Select **Runtime** to view a list of all the Runtime licenses in the bundle.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/RuntimeList.png" class="no-border" >}}

Select **Export in Excel** to export the above lists.

If you would like to see the license payload, click **Show License Payload**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/LicensePayload.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you want to use the Private Cloud License Manager, the Mendix Operator must be in version 2.11.0 or later.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information, see [Private Cloud License Manager](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/private-cloud-license-manager/).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If Global Operator is configured with [Private Cloud License Manager](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/private-cloud-license-manager/), you can view the **Runtime** and **Operator** list of licenses for the main namespace, and only the list of **claims** for the managed namespace.
{{% /alert %}}

## Current Limitations

### Storage Provisioning

If the Operator fails to provision or deprovision storage (a database or file storage), it will not retry the operation. If there is a failed `*-database` or `*-file` pod, you'll need to do the following:

1. Check the failed pod logs for the error message.
2. Troubleshoot and fix the cause of this error.
3. Delete the failed pod to retry the process again.

### Restart Required When Switching Between Ingress and OpenShift Route {#restart-after-changing-network-cr}

Starting with Mendix Operator version 1.5.0, the operator will monitor only one network resource type: Ingress or OpenShift route.

If you switch between Ingress and OpenShift Route, you will need to restart the Mendix Operator so that it can monitor the right network resource (replace `{namespace}` with the namespace where the Operator is installed). This can be done as follows:

For OpenShift:

```shell
oc -n {namespace} scale deployment mendix-operator --replicas=0
oc -n {namespace} scale deployment mendix-operator --replicas=1
```

For Kubernetes:

```shell
kubectl -n {namespace} scale deployment mendix-operator --replicas=0
kubectl -n {namespace} scale deployment mendix-operator --replicas=1
```

### Terminal limitations {#terminal-limitations}

#### Windows

The Windows version of the Configuration Tool must be run in a terminal that supports the Windows console API and has mouse support. PowerShell and the Windows Command Prompt are supported.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When running PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt from the [new Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701), mouse clicks are [not supported](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/376).
Run PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt terminal as a stand-alone app.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Some previously released versions of Mendix for Private Cloud required using Git Bash in Windows.
Starting from Mendix Operator version 1.9.0, Git Bash is no longer required.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Linux and macOS

When running the installation tool over SSH, make sure that the SSH client supports terminal emulation and has mouse support enabled.

`ssh.exe` in Windows doesn't support mouse click forwarding and another SSH client should be used instead, such as [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

### Configuration Tool - Known Issues

When restoring a previously saved session, some UI elements (such as drop-downs and checkboxes) will not use the saved session and will revert to their default values.

For example, the **Authentication** dropdown for Postgres will always switch to `static` authentication.

Selecting the correct value from those drop-downs will restore the state of the form and any fields which might not be visible.

## Troubleshooting

### Status Reporting

This section covers an issue which can arise where Mendix cannot recover automatically and manual intervention may be required.

Under some circumstances changes in the status of the cluster, namespaces, and environments will not be updated automatically. To ensure you are seeing the current status, you may need to click the **Refresh** button on the screen (not the browser page refresh button).

### Windows PowerShell

This section covers how to troubleshoot an issue you may find when running the installation tool with Windows PowerShell Terminal.

### Enable Copy and Paste in Windows PowerShell

If you are unable to copy and paste in the installation tool, you may need to enable it from the Windows PowerShell Properties. Open the **Properties** menu by right clicking the header or by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image34.png" class="no-border" >}}

Select the **Options** tab and enable **Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as <u>C</u>opy/Paste**

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image35.png" class="no-border" >}}

You can now copy and paste with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> in the terminal.

### Unable to Click a Button

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image36.png" class="no-border" >}}

If you highlight a button instead of clicking the button, you may need to disable the **Quick Edit Mode** from the Windows PowerShell Properties.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/image37.png" class="no-border" >}}

After disabling the option you need to enable the new settings. You can do this by navigating to other page by pressing a shortcut key, or reopening the installer tool by closing it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> and reopening the tool with the installation command.

## Containerized Mendix App Architecture  {#containerized-architecture}

Within your cluster you can run one, or several, Mendix apps. Each app runs in an environment, and each environment is in a namespace. You can see the relationship between the Mendix environments and the Kubernetes namespaces in the image below.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/private-cloud/private-cloud-cluster/mx4pc-containerized-architecture.png" class="no-border" >}}

To ensure that every app deployed to a namespace has a unique name, the environment will have an **Environment UUID** added to the environment name when it is deployed to ensure that it is unique in the project. This also ensures the app cannot have the same name as the Mendix tools used to deploy the app. See [Deploying a Mendix App to a Private Cloud Cluster](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-deploy/) for more information.
