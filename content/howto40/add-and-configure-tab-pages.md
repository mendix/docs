 **You can set a tabpage to be the default page (which is opened when opening the form) by changing the 'Default page' property to 'True' in the Properties window.**

 **By default, tabpages will refresh when opened. You can change this behavior by setting the 'Refresh on show' to 'False'.**

 **After setting up the tab pages, add content to them using tables and content widgets.**
