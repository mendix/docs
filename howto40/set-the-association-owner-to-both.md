## Description

## Instructions

 **Create the association if it does not exist yet. If you do not know how to do this, refer to [this](create-an-association) article.**

 **Select the association.**

The above screenshots show the same association; the first shows it using hierarchical notation, whereas the second shows it using UML notation, which was added in version 2.5.1\. You can switch between these modes using the Edit > Preferences menu.
