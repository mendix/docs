A _Published REST Resource_ is part of a [Published REST Service](published-rest-service) and represents a collection of items on which one or more [operations](published-rest-operation) can be defined.

## General

### Resource name

The resource name uniquely identifies the resource in the [service](published-rest-service). It's part of the location of the operations, so it can't contain spaces or special characters.

## Public documentation

The public documentation is used in service's OpenApi (Swagger) documentation page. You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](gfm-syntax) for rich text.
