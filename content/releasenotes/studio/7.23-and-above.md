## 2019

### April 12th, 2019

#### Improvements

* To improve collaboration between Web Modeler users, users that are in the read-only mode can see the changes made by the other Web Modeler user in real-time without the need to refresh the browser page.

### March 29th, 2019

#### New Features

*  We replaced the sync process between Studio and the Desktop Modeler with a new, simplified, process of sharing model changes. You can enable it for apps with Mendix version 7.23.3 and above to experience true  collaborative development within your team. All changes made in Studio are auto-saved, and Desktop Modeler users get these changes when they click **Update** or **Commit**. For more information, see [Collaborative Development](/refguide7/collaborative-development) in *Version Control* and [Collaborative Development in Studio](/web-modeler/general-collaborative-development) in the *Web Modeler Guide*. For information on how to migrate to the new process, see [Migration From the Sync Process to Collaborative Development](/refguide7/collaborative-development-migration). 

    {{% alert type="warning" %}}Existing projects with Mendix version 7.23.2 or below can continue using **Sync with Web Modeler** until September 2019.

*  You can now use a [data grid](/web-modeler/page-editor-data-grid) on your pages. A data grid is a data container that shows a list of objects in a table. For example, a data grid can show all the program items for an event, users can search, add, delete items and perform other functions depending on the settings. For more information, see [Data Grid](/web-modeler/page-editor-data-grid).

* In the page editor, you can now use the **Association** data source for a list view and a data grid. The list view or data grid is filled with the objects linked to the data view object by an association. For example, you can show all orderlines for a customer. This data source is available when the list view/data grid is placed inside another data container, for example, a data view.  

* We added support for [Desktop Modeler 7.23.3](../desktop-modeler/7.23). 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where a custom widget was not correctly shown in the **Toolbox** of the page editor, if this widget no longer existed in a newer package on the App Store.

### March 15th, 2019

#### Improvements

* To speed up the process of creating pages, **Pre-fill page contents based on the `<name>` entity** is now checked by default when creating a new page with an entity.
