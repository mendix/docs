## Introduction

The main difference between a page and page resources is that page is an independent document, while a page resource is a helping document that cannot function on its own. For example, a layout cannot function on its own, but it gives structure to a page. 

You can add the following page resources:

* [Image collection](/refguide8/image-collection/)
* [Layout](/refguide8/layout/)
* [Page template](/refguide8/page-templates/)
* [Snippet](/refguide8/snippet/)
* [Building block](/refguide8/building-block/) 
* [Menu](/refguide8/menu/)

## Adding Page Resources

To add a resource document, do the following:

1. In the [Project Explorer](/refguide8/project-explorer/), right-click the module or a folder you want to add a resource to and select **Add other**:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide8/modeling/pages/page-resources/project-explorer-page-resources.png" class="no-border" >}}

2. Select the document you would like to add to your project.
