### Class

The class property allows you to specify a cascading style sheet (CSS) class that applies to the entire document and its contents. This class will be applied in the browser and can affect how a page is rendered. The class should be a class from the project's theme.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

Styling is applied in the following order: 1) the default styling defined by the theme the project uses, 2) the `Class` property of the widget, and 3) the `Style` property of the widget.

</div>
