## 1 Introduction

Upgrading a solution is the process of merging changes provided by the ISV into a new version of an adaptable solution.

## 2 Prerequisites

To upgrade a Mendix solution, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

* You are using the same Studio Pro version as the version used to create the solution package (for example, if Studio Pro 10.0 was used to create the solution, only that version can be used to upgrade the solution)
* Your version control system is Git
* Your app is currently on the **main** branch line
* The **solution-releases** branch line exists
* There are no uncommitted changes or unresolved conflicts in your app
* There is only one MPR file in the solution package
* The name of your app's MPR file is the same as the name of the MPR file in the solution package
* The solution you are upgrading to is the same solution that was used to set up your adaptable solution

{{% alert color="info" %}}You can consider skipping versions when upgrading. For example, if you set up your solution with v1 and the ISV then released v2 and v3, it is not necessary for you to upgrade versions one by one. You can go directly from v1 to v3 if there were no data migration changes in v2.{{% /alert %}}

## 3 Upgrading Process

To upgrade a solution, follow these steps:

1. Open Studio Pro and click **File** > **Upgrade Solution** (via the feature flag).

2. Select the solution package file (*.mxsolution*) provided by the ISV and click **OK**.
3. Once solution upgrade is completed, a new commit to the **solution-releases** branch line is created. This commit contains the unchanged new version of the solution (as provided by the ISV). You cannot make any changes in this branch, as that would render the solution incompatible with upgrades or lead to unpredictable errors during upgrades.
