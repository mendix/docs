There are two actions you can take:

### 1.1 Edit Settings

When you click on **Edit Settings** you can edit the following things:

*   App Contact
*   App logo

There are two actions you can take:

*   Deactivate the App by clicking **Deactivate App**
*   Delete the App by clicking **Delete App**

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

Note that when you click **Deactivate App** only the account owner can reactivate an app in his account management screen. When you click **Delete App** the app deletion cannot be undone and means ALL DATA WILL BE LOST, including all files on the TeamServer and all data in the FreeApp node (if applicable).
