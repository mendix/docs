space: "Release Notes"
category: "Model SDK"

Note that Model SDK 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 have been skipped (and unpublished from NPM) because installing through NPM failed.

| Impact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Fix | Fixed Model SDK for published `mendixmodelsdk` NPM package missing `dist/` and failing on `npm install`. |
| None | Add support -that's only accessible for trusted backend clients!- for providing a project-to-working copy mapping, locking/unlocking working copies and extra meta data regarding merge requests. |
| None | Widened a parameter type in internal interfaces and classes to fix a problem with using the Model SDK in a Safari browser. |
| None | Refactored MxCheck expression AST hierarchy. |
| None | The Deploy API now returns an additional field `startedFullDeployment` which is `false` if the app was fast-deployed (and completed now), or `true` if a full deployment was needed and further status of the app can be polled through `deployStatus` calls. |
| None | Exposed `mergeState` in the working copy meta data. Added `loadWorkingCopyMetaData` to SDK client to obtain it's meta info without opening it. Exposed `Version` utility class. |
| None | Fixed/extended SDK documentation for the `sortIndex` attribute of `Module`. (Ticket #466184) |
| None | Replaced use of Grunt build system with `npm`. |
