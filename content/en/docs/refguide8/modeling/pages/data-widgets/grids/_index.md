## Introduction

Grids show a list a objects and include a [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid/) and a [template grid](/refguide8/template-grid/). The main difference between these grids is the way the list of objects is displayed: a data grid shows it in columns, while a template grid shows it in tiles. 

Grids have the following components in common:

* [Search bar](/refguide8/search-bar/) – allows end-users to search for objects in the grid 
* [Sort bar](/refguide8/sort-bar/) – allows end-users to sort items in the grid 
* [Control bar](/refguide8/control-bar/) – allows end-users to control the objects displayed in the grid by means of buttons
