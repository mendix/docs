App services are a way of connecting Mendix applications to each other. An app service can be imported and its content can be used. As for now, app services provide the following content: 

* Microflow actions
* Domain model entities

In the project explorer, an app service can be selected in the 'Add' context menu on a module. See [Select app service](/refguide7/select-app-service/) for more information.

See the [Settings](/refguide7/settings/) page for more information on document options.

App service actions are directly available in Microflows. If a new activity is added, new app service actions are shown below the standard microflow actions.

An app service action may require parameters, and usually it supplies a return value. The return value can be used in the rest of the microflow. Parameters and return values can be an object or a list type; the entities which are accepted by the app service are included in the domain model of the app service.
