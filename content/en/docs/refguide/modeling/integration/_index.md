## 1 Introduction

Integration with other applications (other Mendix apps, or applications built with different technology) can be done using OData, REST or SOAP/Web Services. Mendix can import and export data from XML and JSON.

Integration between Mendix applications is done best with REST services (for details, see [Published REST Service](/refguide/published-rest-services/) and [Call REST Service](/refguide/call-rest-action/)). Some of the terms used most often are explained below.
