## 1 Introduction

The [Amazon DynamoDB](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/204872) connector provides a way for you to increase the security, scalability, and performance of your Mendix app by implementing [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Amazon DynamoDB helps improve your app by giving you the tools to build scalable, performant applications on a flexible, serverless database. You can use it to develop high-traffic online platforms and applications for a variety of modern industries, such as content streaming, electronic commerce, or gaming.

### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The Amazon DynamoDB connector requires Mendix Studio Pro 9.18.0 or above.

To use the Amazon DynamoDB connector, you must also install and configure the following modules:

* [AWS Authentication connector version 2.0 or higher](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333) - This connector is required to authenticate with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is crucial for the Amazon DynamoDB connector to function correctly. If you are using the Amazon DynamoDB connector version 2.0 or higher, it requires the AWS Authentication connector version 3.0 or higher. It is crucial for the Amazon S3 connector to function correctly. For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/modules/aws/aws-authentication/).
* [Community Commons module](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/170) - This module is required to parse the `creationDateTime` attribute as returned by the `DescribeTable` activity.

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Installation

Follow the instructions in [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/use-content/) to import the Amazon DynamoDB connector into your app.

## 3 Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonDynamoDBConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon DynamoDB. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### 3.1 Configuring AWS Authentication

In order to use the Amazon DynamoDB service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

As of version 3.0.0 of the [AWS Authentication Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333), all the resources and logic required to set up authentication are centralized inside the AWS Authentication Connector module. 

The AWS Authentication Connector supports both **static credentials** and **temporary credentials**. For more information and detailed instructions please refer to the [AWS Authentication Connector documentation page](/appstore/modules/aws/aws-authentication/).

### 3.2 Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After you configure the authentication profile for Amazon DynamoDB, you can implement the functions of the connector by using the provided activities in microflows. For example, to list all Amazon DynamoDB tables for a specific region, implement the [ListTables](#list-tables) activity by doing the following steps:

1. In the **App Explorer**, find and open the domain model for your app.
2. Right-click on the working area of the domain model, and then click **Add entity**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-contents/modules/aws-dynamodb/addentity.png" alt="Adding a new entity to the domain model" class="no-border" >}}

3. Open the new entity by double-clicking on it.
4. Enter a name for the entity, for example, `DBTable`.
5. In the **Attributes** section, click **New**, and then configure the attribute in the following way:
    * **Name** - A unique name for the attribute, for example, `TableName`
    * **Type** - **String**

    The parameters that you need to configure depend on the contents of the response that an activity expects. The **ListTables** activity used in this example only expects the database table name as a response. Other activities require different parameters. For more information, see [Activities](#activities).
6. In the **App Explorer**, right-click on the name of your module, and then click **Add microflow**.
    
    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-contents/modules/aws-dynamodb/addmicroflow.png" alt="Adding a microflow" class="no-border" >}}

7. Enter a name for your microflow, for example, *DS_ListTables*, and then click **OK**.
8. In the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonDynamoDBConnector** > **Operations** section, find the **ListTables** activity.
9. Drag the **ListTables** activity onto the work area of your microflow.

### 4.3 Activities {#activities}

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow. For the Amazon DynamoDB connector, they represent the actions that can be performed on DynamoDB database tables.

#### 4.3.1 BatchGetItem

The `BatchGetItem` Amazon DynamoDB activity allows you to get multiple items from DynamoDB in a single call. It requires a valid AWS Region, a `Credentials` object and a `BatchGetItemRequest` object that contains the tables from which the item must be fetched. You must also specify whether the activity should perform a consistent read, and provide a list of keys to query from.

The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `BatchGetItemRequest` (Object) | `BatchGetItemResponse` (Object) |
| `Region` (Enumeration) | |
| `Credentials` (Object) | |

#### 4.3.2 ListTables {#list-tables}

The `ListTables` Amazon DynamoDB activity allows you to retrieve a list of `Table` objects for a given region, which contains the table's name. It requires a valid AWS Region, a `Credentials` object and a `ListTablesRequest` object.

The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:

| Input | Output |
