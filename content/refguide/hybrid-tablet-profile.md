When the hybrid tablet profile is enabled, every user that accesses the Mendix application from a PhoneGap hybrid application running on a tablet device will automatically be redirected to this profile. If the hybrid tablet profile is disabled, tablet users will be redirected to the [hybrid phone profile](hybrid-phone-profile). If the hybrid phone profile is disabled, users will be redirected to the [desktop profile](desktop-profile).
