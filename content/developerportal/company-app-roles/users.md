There are three tabs on the **Users** page with settings to manage:

## 2 Users Tab

On the **Users** tab, you can view, [deactivate](#deactivating), and [activate](#activating) users. 

You can also [create reports](#create-report) about your company's users by clicking **Create Report**, view the apps of a user by clicking **Show Apps**, and reset a user's password by clicking **Reset Password**.

### 2.1 Deactivating Users {#deactivating}

For security reasons, deactivating the Mendix profile of an employee that is leaving your company is recommended. If the employee returns to your company, the Mendix profile can be activated again. 

{{% alert type="info" %}}
If a Mendix user moves to another company or comes from another company that is also using Mendix, the user can merge their old Mendix account(s) into the new Mendix account. This action combines all the hard-earned points, certifications, and achievements in the user's efforts to climb the leaderboards. For more information, see the [Merging Your Accounts](../mendix-profile/index#merging) of *Mendix Profile*.
{{% /alert %}}

Before deactivating a user, make sure the following points are true for that user:

* They do not have a **Company Contact**, **App Contact**, or **Technical Contact** role
* They are not the only **Scrum Master** in an App Team
* They are not involved in unsolved support tickets with [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com)

For more information, see [How to Manage Company & App Roles](/developerportal/company-app-roles/manage-roles) and [Company & App Roles](/developerportal/company-app-roles/index).

To deactivate a user, follow these steps:

1.  Select the check box for the user(s) you want to deactivate, then click **Activate / Deactivate user**.:

The deactivated user will become inactive and will immediately disappear from the list of users on this tab. If you click **Filter** and select **Inactive**, you will see the deactivated users.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

You can only deactivate a user. It is not possible to delete a user completely.

### 2.3 Creating a Report {#create-report}

Click **Create Report** to create a report about users active in your company. These are users who are either members of the company or members of an app owned by the company.

You have the following report options:

* **Export users** – this report will return a list of users who are active in your company and your company's apps, including external users that are part of your company's App Teams
* **Export permissions** – this report will return a list of permissions for users active in your company's apps

You can export these reports by clicking **Export to Excel**. Note that the exports will contain further details in addition to those shown on the screen.
