## 1 Introduction

As of Mendix 8, it is possible to build fully native mobile apps. Native mobile apps differ from hybrid apps in that they do not render inside a web view. Instead, they use native UI elements. This enables fast performance, smooth animations, like swipe gestures, and improved access to all native device capabilities.

You build Mendix native mobile apps the same way you build web or hybrid apps. You can use familiar elements such as pages, widgets, nanoflows, JavaScript actions, and microflows to put together your app. However, there are some differences between building native apps and hybrid apps. For example, the set of available widgets (and their properties) is slightly different. In addition, native styling is based on JavaScript instead of SASS/CSS.
