## 1 Introduction

This section provides information and best practices on how to develop solutions on the Mendix Platform that are ready to be sold on the Mendix Marketplace.

While [Mendix best practices for development](/howto/general/dev-best-practices) apply, there are additional considerations when architecting and developing a Mendix solution. The overview of [Architecting Adaptive Solutions](sol-architecting) is a good starting point. Then, continue reading how to apply [IP Protection](sol-ip-protection) to make your solution ready to sell to customers.
