## 1 Introduction

Your Mendix Profile is your main point of contact with members of the Mendix community. It displays your activities on the Mendix Platform and details about your background. To get more involved in the Mendix community, your profile is the best place to start. 

You can access your Mendix profile by clicking your picture in the upper-right corner of the Developer Portal and then selecting **See Your Profile**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
By default, any newly created Mendix account comes with its own Mendix Profile.

## 2 Header {#header}

Your profile header displays a quick overview of information about you. Your Mendix experience in level and points, your number of [credits](#challenges), and your number of [connections](#connections) are all found here. You can also select up to four featured [badges](#badges) to display your progress on the Mendix Platform. If you have a certificate from the Mendix [Academy](https://academy.mendix.com), this will also be displayed. The **Personal Info** card presents other information.

You can change these details in the [Settings](#settings).

## 3 Overview and Stats

Your profile opens to the **Overview** tab, which shows you at a quick glance how you are doing on the platform. You can see the following:

* Stats 
* Badges in progress and the next badges to work towards
* Assigned challenge
* Personal information
* Invitations
* Position on the leaderboard
* Portfolio

The first profile card below the header presents your **Stats**, which are your points divided between Mendix products and activities:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/stats.png"   width="350"  >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Don't get disappointed about a low number of points, because everyone in the Mendix community started like that, even our Expert developers! There are plenty of opportunities to gain more points and climb the [Leaderboard](#leaderboard).
{{% /alert %}}

## 4 Badges {#badges}

In addition to the **Stats** chart, on the **Overview** tab you gain an overview of your **Badges**. These badges represent your achievements and progress on the Mendix Platform. You can see your **Badges in Progress** as well as **Next Badges**. The badges are color-coded based from green (least rare), to blue, purple, and orange (most rare).

To see all your badges as well as the badges you can work towards, click **View all** to go to the **Badges** tab of your profile. On that tab, you can select up to four badges from the **Earned badges** section to make visible in your profile [header](#header) by clicking **Select as featured**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the **Earned badges** section, you find the badges you have completed. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown.
{{% /alert %}}

The percentage on the card of the **Badges in progress** shows how far you have come to earn that particular badge. If the badge is a multi-level badge, only the highest completed badge is shown, so don't get distracted while earning it!

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/badges.png"   width="350"  >}}

## 5 Challenges {#challenges}

The **Challenge** card presents a featured challenge you can complete to gain credits. You can use the credits in the [Mendix Shop](https://shop.mendix.com) to order low-code t-shirts or other Mendix swag. Some challenges are going to be easy for you, whilst others might be harder to complete!

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/challenges.png"   width="350"  >}}

Click **View All** to go to the **Challenges** tab of your profile. This tab presents more details on the challenge steps, the time left, and how many credits you can earn with them. You can complete these activities in any order you like.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/credits.png"   width="350"  >}}

When you complete a challenge, click **Claim Credits** to claim the Mendix credits. You can then spend your credits on cool items in the Mendix Shop.

## 6 Connections {#connections}

One of the greatest strengths of Mendix is our awesome developers community, and the **Connections** card is the perfect place to start connecting to other Mendix developers. When you get an invitation to connect, you can check out their profile and decide whether to accept or ignore it. 

You can also see a list of people you may know so that you can add further connections to your profile. To connect with someone, click the plus icon to send an invitation.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/connections.png"   width="350"  >}}

Clicking **View All** on the card will bring you to the **Connections** tab of your profile. On this tab, you can invite friends and colleagues to Mendix in two ways:

* **Share URL** – copy the personalized invite link and share it directly
* **Send Invite** – send someone a Mendix invite by entering their email address

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/referral.png"   width="500"  >}}

## 7 Leaderboard {#leaderboard}

This card on your profile presents your points and ranking for the last 30 days:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/leaderboard.png" width="500px" alt="Leaderboard example" >}}

Clicking **View All** takes you to the **Leaderboards** page, where you can view leaders per category, for the whole Mendix Platform, or for your company only.

You can climb the leaderboard by earning points through various activities on the Mendix Platform. For example, let's say you have some time to spare while your app is deploying. You get a cup of coffee and check out the [Mendix Forum]. One questions pops out because you came across a similar problem a few weeks back. You decide to help the community member and post an answer to their question. Not long after, the author marks your answer as accepted. Boom! 15 points right there.

#### 10.1.1 Merge Profiles

If you own two (or more user accounts) it is recommended to merge the profiles of these user accounts with each other. It saves you from maintenance of multiple profiles and your community contributions will be stored with the one profile you’re actively using, leading to one stronger profile instead of keeping track of your progress scattered in multiple Mendix profiles in the Platform. The **Merge Profile** process will merge information associated to the to be merged profiles, resulting in a single profile with 2 (or more) user accounts related to it.

##### The merge process {#merge-process}

Prerequisites for the profile merge actions:

* Two (or more) user accounts
* Platform Access with at least one of these user accounts.
* Ability to receive emails for the to-be-merge user profiles. (This can be the login email address or profile email address)

##### User account Platform access

Before you start with a new profile merge action it is important to understand what scenarios are possible and what it means for the profile merge process. 
The following starting scenarios are possible:

* **All user accounts give you access to the Mendix Platform** - Considering you have access to the platform with all your user accounts, you are able to initiate a merge having signed in with any of them. For the other profile a confirmation email message is sent, to allow for the merge action to start (for details on what information will end up in the merge result profile, see the [Result of merge process](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/#merge-profile-result) section below).
* **One of the user accounts gives you access to the Mendix Platform** - Considering you have access to only one of the user accounts, the profile merge process can only be initiated from that account. Furthermore, the user account you signed in with will determine what profile information will end up in the merge result profile for the properties where the system can’t determine which information should be kept (for details on on what information will end up in the merge result profile, see the [Result of merge process](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/#merge-profile-result) section below).
For the other profile a confirmation email message is sent to allow for the merge action to start. 
* **None of the user accounts gives you access to the Mendix Platform** - You should own at least one user account that gives access to the Mendix Platform.

##### Ability to receive emails for the to-be-merged user profiles
When merging user profiles, a merge confirmation is needed for the user account you are not signed in with. The verification code which you need to confirm the merge operation will arrive by email. Therefore, it is required to be able to receive the verification email in an email inbox that is associated to the user account or to the the associated profile.  

##### Step-by-step Merge process

From this page, click **Merge Profile**. After entering the email address of one of the accounts linked to the profile you want to transfer information from in the dialog box, click Next and you will be asked to choose an email address to receive a verification code. You should choose an email address you have access to. This step is needed to verify you are the owner of the Mendix profile you are trying to merge.

After entering the verification code you received in the selected email address, click **Verify** and you will see an overview of the profile information that will be deleted and those that will be kept. You will see the earned points, achievements, credits, certifications, and Academy progress that will be merged to your target profile.

{{% alert color="info" %}} 
With the merge, the accounts of both profiles are kept. None of the accounts will be deactivated from the Mendix Platform. That should be done by a [Mendix Admin](/developerportal/control-center/#members).
{{% /alert %}}

If you are sure you want to proceed with the merge, click Merge. You will be notified once the merge is completed.

##### Result of the merge process {#merge-profile-result}
The result of the profile merge process is the profile information of the merged profiles resulting into one profile. Information that can be added to the profile will all be associated with the resulting profile. However, in the situation where there is conflicting data for the two to-be-merged profiles, the system will use the profile data of the user account the user is signed in with. The following data can conflict, but can be easily updated after the merge process: 

* Full name
* Avatar image
* Job title
* Country of residence
* About you
* Twitter URL
* LinkedIn URL

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
It is not possible to separate profiles after they have been merged. Double-check that both your profile information is valid.
{{% /alert %}}

##### FAQ
**I don’t have access to any of the email addresses of the user account/profile I want to merge, what now?**
If you do not have access to any of these email addresses and you cannot log in with the Profile you want to merge, click **Create Support Request**  to go to Mendix Support. Mendix Support Team will contact you to change the profile (**Recovery**) email. Once this is done, you will be able to **Merge Profile** yourself, following the above steps. 

### 10.2 Account

This page is an overview of all the accounts you own and are linked to your Mendix profile. You can see which account you are logged in with, the company associated with each user account, if Single Sign On is enabled and the status of each user account (Active or Deactivated)

By default, you are requested to change your password every 90 days. A Mendix Admin can change this password policy setting in [Control Center](/developerportal/control-center/#security).

You can update the password of each of your accounts via the [Change Password](https://login.mendix.com/mxid3/request-password-reset) button, which you can also reach using the **Forgot password?** link on the login screen.

If you do not want to use an account anymore, you can remove it from this page. Click the menu button next to the account you want to delete and select **Forget this Account**. All of the account information is then removed and deleted from our servers. All the personal and identifiable information of your profile will be deleted when you delete all your accounts.

### 10.3 Notifications {#notifications}

On this page, you can configure how you want to be notified of Mendix Platform activity.

When you click **Configure Watched Apps** at the bottom of the page, you can choose to **Stop Watching** an app. To watch an app again, return to [My Apps](/developerportal/#my-apps).

You can also configure your **Buzz Notifications**:

* **Receive daily digest** – disabled by default
* **Receive updates for Buzz threads in which I am active** – enabled by default

### 10.4 Developer Settings {#dev-settings}

#### 10.4.1 API Keys {#profile-api-keys}

In this section, you can create and view the API keys that external applications can use to connect via the [Mendix Platform APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/) on behalf of your user account. An API key created here allows the apps using it to act on behalf of the user who created the key. This means the apps will have the same privileges as the user who created the key. An API key allows you to execute operations that need authentication without a password. For example, you can use an API key to perform scripted operations on your application model with the SDK. 

To get a Mendix API key, click **Configure API Keys** > **Create New API Key** and follow the instructions.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Make a note of the API key, as it will only be shown once. 
{{% /alert %}}

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/api-key.png" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
We may cache your API key. This means that when you revoke an API key, it may take some time before the change takes effect.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information, see the following:

* [Authentication](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/authentication/)
* [APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/)
* [Mendix Platform SDK](/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/)
* [How to Manage App API Keys](/developerportal/settings/api-key/)

#### 10.4.2 Personal Access Tokens {#pat}

Some platform APIs use personal access tokens (PATs) rather than API keys. This sections explains the concept of PATs, how you can obtain one, and how you can use this security token to give an application access to Mendix Platform services on your behalf.

PATs are used as alternatives to passwords. They are designed to be used when the client application needs to get access on behalf of a specific platform user, but the user is not "present" at the time of access, so the user cannot login via a browser (web SSO). The client application can be any application (meaning, even an app not built with Mendix).

You can create a PAT and remain in control of what access is delegated via the PAT by selecting the scopes. The PAT itself is a "bearer" token, which means that anyone or anything that has access to the PAT can use it as if they were the associated platform user subject to the restrictions set up in the scope of the PAT.

PATs are security tokens that do not expire, but they cannot be used if the associated user has been deactivated on the Mendix Platform or when the user has deleted the PAT.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
From a governance aspect, it is important for Mendix Admins to deactivate ex-employees in the Mendix Platform. This will prevent those leavers from logging into the platform, and it also blocks the delegated access via PATs. This recommendation applies both when users use Mendix credentials, and when users use SSO with authentication provided by their corporate IDP (BYOIDP).
{{% /alert %}}

The following Mendix services support usage of PATs:

* [Data Hub Catalog API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/data-hub-apis/)
* [App Repository API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/app-repository-api/)
* [Projects API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/projects-api/)

##### 10.4.2.1 Creating a PAT

When you click **New Token**, you need to set the following characteristics of the PAT:

* **Name** – give the PAT a name that reflects where or why you intend to use it
* **Defined Scopes** – the scopes (authorizations) that you want to delegate to your PAT

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/create-pat.png" width="500px" alt="Dialog box for defining the PAT scopes" >}}

Details about the scopes can be found in the documentation for specific services.

After you click **Create**, a pop-up window shows your secret token, which is the PAT. You must copy the secret token via **Copy Token**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/token-secret.png" width="500px" alt="Created PAT in pop-up window" >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Store the secret token in a safe location, because it will not be displayed again!
{{% /alert %}}

##### 10.4.2.2 Managing a PAT

To see the scopes of a PAT you have created, click **View Details**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/manage-pat.png" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You cannot see the secret token of a PAT here. You can only see that the PAT exists along with its scopes. 
{{% /alert %}}

You can delete a PAT you have created via **Delete**. This will prevent anyone who has obtained the PAT's secret token from successfully using it.

##### 10.4.2.3 Using a PAT

Use of a PAT depends on the API you are accessing.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
For security reasons, you should not include PATs into your source code.
{{% /alert %}}

To use a PAT with the [Data Hub APIs](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/data-hub-apis/), it must be passed as the authorization header on every request made to the Data Hub Catalog. The request will look like this:

```http
GET /v1/register HTTP/1.1
Host: catalog.mendix.com
Authorization: mxtoken <your personal access token>
```

If the PAT is not valid, the response will be `HTTP 403 Access Denied`:

```http
403 Access Denied
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "error": ""
}
```

For information on other PAT usages, see the [App Repository API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/app-repository-api/) and [Projects API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/projects-api/).

### 10.5 Personal Data

The Mendix Platform stores certain personal information about you. You can view this information by clicking  **Download Personal Data**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Mendix has been tracking these data changes since November 2018.
