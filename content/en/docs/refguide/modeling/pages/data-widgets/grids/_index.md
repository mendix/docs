## Introduction

Grids show a list of objects and include a [data grid](/refguide/data-grid/) and a [template grid](/refguide/template-grid/). The main difference between these grids is the way the list of objects is displayed: a data grid shows it in columns, while a template grid shows it in tiles.

[Data grid 2](/appstore/modules/data-grid-2/) is a special type of grid, available as part of the [Data Widgets](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/116540) Marketplace module.

Grids have the following components in common:

* [Search bar](/refguide/search-bar/) – allows end-users to search for objects in the grid 
* [Sort bar](/refguide/sort-order/#sort-bar) – allows end-users to sort items in the grid 
* [Control bar](/refguide/control-bar/) – allows end-users to control the objects displayed in the grid by means of buttons 

## Choosing a Grid

If your app needs to display data on a page, different widgets suit different use cases. Determine what type of data you need to display, imagine how you would like it presented, and then consult the options below.

### Data Grid

* Displaying data as a table
* Employing several rows and columns
* Displaying simple text data

### Template Grid

The [template grid](/refguide/template-grid/) widget is well suited for these cases:

* Displaying tiles with each list item
* Showing an image
* Adding a button to your list item
* Creating a custom layout for your items

### Data Grid 2

The [data grid 2](/appstore/modules/data-grid-2/) widget is an expanded version of the standard data grid widget for displaying content in a tabular form. It is well suited for these cases:
