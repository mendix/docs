## Mendix Mobile

For details on each release, see [Mendix Mobile](index).

### Known issues

* Mendix hybrid apps loaded using e.g. the QR scanner or the manual app loading screen are not able to use the barcode scanning widget. Using barcode scanning functionality from within an app-specific hybrid app (i.e. built using the Mobile App flow from within the Portal) should not pose any problems.
* On iOS 11, loading one of the sample apps or loading an app using the QR scanner will crash the application. **Resolved in 4.4.1**
