## 4.2.0

| Story | Impact | Description |
|------|-----|---|
| MS-317 | Medium | Removed `projectId` from `IWorkingCopy`, as it was never set. Use `IWorkingCopy.metaData.projectId` instead. |
| MS-377 | Medium | Added optional `locktype` parameter to the lockWorkingCopy method. |
| MS-359 | None | Added support for Modeler version 7.6.0. |
| MS-352 | Low | Fixed the initialization of default values. |

The code snippet below is an example of what was broken in **MS-352**. The default value of `layoutCall` should be `null`, but it used to be (incorrectly) set to a new instance of `LayoutCall`. This is no longer the case, and it can be fixed by initializing `layout.layoutCall` to a new `LayoutCall` instance before assigning the `layout` property.

```
const layout = pages.Layout.createIn(this.module);
...
layout.layoutCall.layout = this.masterLayout;
```
