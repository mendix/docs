## 1 Introduction

Within Mendix, there are two use-cases for the Feedback widget:

* To provide feedback on Mendix
* To provide feedback on your own app

In the **Developer Portal**, you can view and manage the feedback that is provided on your app by clicking **Feedback** in the **Collaborate** category.

You can divide the feedback into the following four stages:

* Open
* Handled
* Accepted
* Closed

### 1.1 Actions

You can click the following buttons:

* **Add feedback**
* **Export to Excel**, which will export feedback items into an *.xls* file (you can filter on date, label, status, and type)

### 1.2 Filters

When you click **Show filter**, you can filter on the following:

* Idea
* Question
* Issue

## 2 Feedback Details

Click **Details** for more information about this particular feedback item. On the detail page, click the plus sign (+) to see the following:

* Feedback number
* Active userroles
* Active form
* Screen size
* Browser
* Application location
* Submission date

On this page, you can also **Turn email updates on/off**.

When you click **Post a comment**, you can add files within a comment. 

### 2.1 Actions

You can manage the feedback item with the following actions:

* Accept feedback
* Mark "Under review"
* Mark as handled
* Close feedback

### 2.2 Convert

If the feedback type is not correct, you can convert it afterwards by selecting one of these options:

* Convert to idea
* Convert to question
* Convert to issue

### 2.3 Move to App

This option allows you to move a particular feedback item to another app.

You are only allowed to move a feedback item to an app in which you are already a team-member.

### 2.4 Delete

When clicking **Delete feedback**, be sure that you want to delete that feedback item, because this will remove all the associated messages as well.

This action cannot be undone.
