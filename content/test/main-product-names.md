## Mendix Developer Portal {#devportal}

This term appears on the **My Apps** page in Studio Pro and in the **Back to the Developer Portal** button in Studio. The Developer Portal includes what is sometimes referred to as the "Cloud Portal," which is not an official term and is not used in the product UI or documentation.

## Mendix Studio Pro {#pro}

## Mendix Studios

Where you are describing a feature applicable to both Mendix Studio and Studio Pro, use "Mendix Studio and Studio Pro." However, after you introduce the names of both products once and need to refer to them together again, use "the Mendix Studios."

When you need to use one general product name in a diagram, it is fine to use just "Studios."
