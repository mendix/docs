## 3 Creating a Feedback Item

You can create a feedback item via the **Buzz** tab. Feedback items allow you to submit ideas, questions, or issues on the app, and let your team work on them in the Developer Portal. Potentially, a feedback item can be turned into a story and be planned for a sprint. For more information on feedback items, see [Feedback Management](/developerportal/collaborate/feedback). For more information on stories, see the [Adding a Feedback Item to Your Backlog](/developerportal/collaborate/feedback#adding) section in Feedback Management.  

To create a feedback item, do the following:

1. Click the posted comment. For more information on how to leave a comment, see the [Leaving and Editing Comments](#comment) section.

2.  Click the ellipsis icon and select **Create Feedback Item**:
