## 1 What You Can Expect from Mendix Support

Mendix Support is here to answer any questions and solve any issues that you might have. We try to make your journey as frictionless as possible.

### 1.1 Service Level Agreements {#sla}

We are available for all users of the Mendix Platform, and we are bound by service-level agreements (SLAs) with our licensed customers. Licensed customers can select their SLA level: **Standard** or **Premium**. The SLA level determines the specific agreement in the following areas:

* Support availability
* Platform availability
* Maintenance
* Incident response time
* Incident resolution time
* Recovery time objective (RTO)
* Recovery point objective (RPO)

You can check the Mendix SLA [here](https://mendix.com/sla).

### 1.2 Premier Support

In addition to our Premium SLA, Mendix offers **Premier Support**, with elevated support levels, specifically for customers with business critical apps.
The Premier Support package contains the following for customers on the Mendix Public or Dedicated Cloud:

* 24/7 support availability for critical and high tickets
* 24/5 support availability for medium and low tickets
* Direct access to a senior designated team (Support and R&D)
* Escalation hotline for Production down issues
* Proactive app monitoring on critical issues
* Quarterly ticket review meetings with the senior designated team

Please contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/) or your Customer Success Manager if you want to know more.

## 2 Finding Your Answers

We expect that many questions and issues can be solved by reading the [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/) and by exploring the [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/). If you cannot find the answer to your question in one of these locations, you can submit a question, incident, or change request to Mendix Support. We will act as the focal point for issues on Mendix Studio and Studio Pro, your applications, and the [Developer Portal](https://home.mendix.com/). We will forward the issue to the second- and third-line if necessary.

## 3 Feature Requests

We would like to invite you to an important channel where you can provide feature requests to Mendix: the [Mendix Idea Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/link/ideas). Any customer can post a feature request that can be reviewed, expanded on, and voted on by other members of the Mendix community. Based on this feedback, every quarter we will determine which features have the most value according to our customers, and we will implement them.

For more details, see [Forum](/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-forum/).

## 4 Accessing Mendix Support

You can access the Mendix Support team through the [Mendix Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com/), via email (`support@mendix.com`), or by phone (phone numbers are listed in the Support Portal). Please note that critical tickets always need to be accompanied by a phone call to speed up the triage of the issue. In the Support Portal, you can check the status of your personal tickets, check all the submitted tickets for your applications, and provide updates on them.

## 5 What We Expect from You

Mendix supports the Mendix Platform, and we expect you to support the applications that you build on the platform. The following points are not supported through the standard SLA:

* Developing code on your behalf
* Debugging or troubleshooting your applications
* Analyzing and troubleshooting the health and performance of your applications or your infrastructure, except when we suspect an underlying issue exists in the Mendix Platform
* Troubleshooting Mendix community-developed components from the Mendix Marketplace

For more information, see the [Support for Different Deployment Strategies](#support-by-strategy) section below.

During the start phase, and through part of the scale phase, of your digital transformation journey, it might be best to let your development team (DevOps) handle the support of the applications. As the number of applications grows, it is best to let an expert service desk handle the support of your applications. You can involve your existing service desk team or outsource support to one of our support partners, which you can find listed on the [Meet Our Partners](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/link/partneroverview) page.

### 5.1 Mendix Admins

To manage your company account, and the users, projects, and licensed cloud nodes of your company, you can appoint [Mendix Admins](/developerportal/control-center/#company).

Please read more about this in [Control Center](/developerportal/control-center/).

### 5.2 Technical Contacts

You need to appoint a [technical contact](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles/#technical-contact) for each of your applications running in the Mendix Public Cloud and Cloud Dedicated. The technical contact checks the performance of the applications in the Developer Portal and receives alerts from the Mendix Developer Portal based on errors and warnings in the application. It is possible to have other team members receive these alerts as well.
Reading these alerts carefully and acting upon them is important, as they can affect the performance of your app. For more information on alerts, see [Alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health/).

### 5.3 Training

We expect your support team to be trained and certified on Studio Pro and the Developer Portal so that they can interpret and analyze alerts, graphs, and logs in the Developer Portal. For more information, please check our available [classroom courses](https://academy.mendix.com/link/classroom) and [expert webinars](https://academy.mendix.com/link/webinar) or contact the Mendix Academy ([academy@mendix.com](mailto:academy@mendix.com)).

## 6 Platform Status

If there is an issue with the Mendix platform that affects multiple customers, or if there is planned maintenance, we will communicate this through our [status page](https://status.mendix.com/) and send updates on the progress through email if you have subscribed to this service. It is recommended that your service desk team subscribes to updates from this page.

## 7 Reach Out to Mendix Support

If, after your analysis, you suspect there is an issue with the Mendix Platform (or if you have questions about your analysis), you can reach out to Mendix Support. We will provide pointers on how to solve the issues yourself or redirect you to Expert Services for further assistance. If we suspect a platform issue, we will involve second- and third-line support for confirmation and, if it is a platform issue, we will fix it. If the issue is commercial (for example, because your app requires a larger app container or more file storage), we may refer you to your Customer Success Manager directly.

## 8 Product Support Period

Mendix supports the current major release and the two prior major releases (and we support each major release for a minimum of 24 months). Because of this, we recommend that you upgrade your apps to the latest version of Studio Pro at least once a year. We will reach out to you in time if you are running on a version that will become unsupported so that you have ample time to perform an upgrade.

## 9 Support for Different Deployment Strategies {#support-by-strategy}

With our Multi-Cloud strategy, Mendix allows the apps that you build to be deployed in any Cloud. This can be in the [Mendix Public Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/), Mendix Dedicated Cloud, [Mendix Private Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud/), [SAP Business Technology Platform](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/), or in other on-premises and Cloud architectures.

### 10.4 Buildpack, m2ee & Service Console

The Mendix buildpacks for [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack) and [Docker](https://github.com/mendix/docker-mendix-buildpack) are available in GitHub repositories. The documentation for the buildpacks and m2ee tools is contained within these GitHub repositories and, because they are released under an Open Source license, the code can be inspected and the functionality and options can be understood by customers who wish to use these buildpacks.

If you want to run Mendix apps on a Unix-like server you will need the [m2ee tools](https://github.com/mendix/m2ee-tools), available on GitHub. Read more about installing on systems running Unix-like operating systems in [Unix Deployment](/developerportal/deploy/unix-like/).

Only when running on the Mendix Public Cloud or Cloud Dedicated, can Mendix Support diagnose these components. Because Mendix has no control over the context in which the buildpack or m2ee tools are run outside of the Mendix Public Cloud and Cloud Dedicated, you will have to demonstrate that the bug is in the supported component by showing the behavior independently from the context in which you are using it.

If you want additional features or some other change in a buildpack or m2ee tools, you can make a Pull Request , create an Issue in the GitHub repository, or contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/).

If you wan to run Mendix apps on Windows server you will need the [Windows Service](/releasenotes/studio-pro/windows-service/).
