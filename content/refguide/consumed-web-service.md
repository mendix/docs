### Services

This part contains the services to be found in the WSDL.

*   Name is the name of the service.
*   Port is selected port in multiple-port service.
*   Location is where the service is located.
*   Location constant can be used to add additional locations for a service, for example: the URL of the soap service may change when moving from a development to a production environment. See also [Constants](constants).

If there is a multiple-port service defined in the WSDL, a dialog will pop up that allows the user to select which one of the ports to use_._

### Operations

This part contains all the operations found in the WSDL. You can expand the list and see additional information about individual operations in the right pane.

### Advanced Settings

*   Send binary data as attachment (MTOM) - enable or disable MTOM: the _Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism_, a method of efficiently sending binary data to and from Web services. Read more about it at [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-mtom/). Please note that message optimization will only be applied when you use one or more export mappings to create the request body in the Call web service action.
