## 1 Introduction

The [Simple Check Box Set Selector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2349/) enables rending a reference set association as a check box list. It is a useful replacement for the default [reference set selector](/refguide/reference-set-selector).

### 1.1 Typical Usage Scenario

* Visualizing all possible options in your UI, instead of forcing your user to open a pop-up window to reference available options

### 1.2 Features

* Displaying a list horizontally or vertically
* Optionally showing a label
* Attaching a microflow to the on-change event

## 2 Installation

After importing the widget into your app, add it to a [data view](/refguide/data-view) on a page. Then, configure the properties to determine how the widget will behave in your application.
