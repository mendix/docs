## 1 Introduction

The [Amazon DynamoDB](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/204872) connector provides a way for you to increase the security, scalability, and performance of your Mendix app by implementing [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Amazon DynamoDB helps improve your app by giving you the tools to build scalable, performant applications on a flexible, serverless database. You can use it to develop high-traffic online platforms and applications for a variety of modern industries, such as content streaming, electronic commerce, or gaming.

### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The Amazon DynamoDB connector requires Mendix Studio Pro version 9.18.0 or above.

To use the Amazon DynamoDB connector, you must also install and configure the following modules:

* [AWS Authentication connector version 2.0 or higher](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333) - This connector is required to authenticate with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is crucial for the Amazon DynamoDB connector to function correctly. For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).
* [Community Commons module](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/170) - This module is required to parse the `creationDateTime` attribute as returned by the `DescribeTable` activity.

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Installation

Follow the instructions in [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](/appstore/general/app-store-content/) to import the Amazon DynamoDB connector into your app.

## 3 Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonDynamoDBConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon DynamoDB. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### 3.1 Configuring AWS Authentication

In order to use the Amazon DynamoDB service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

1. Ensure that you have installed and configured the AWS Authentication connector, as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. Decide whether you want to use session or static credentials to authenticate.
    The Amazon DynamoDB connector supports both session and static credentials. By default, the connector is pre-configured to use static credentials, but you may want to switch to session credentials, for example, to increase the security of your app. For an overview of both authentication methods, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).
3. In the **App Explorer**, double-click the **Settings** for your app.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-dynamodb/appsettings.png" alt="The Settings option in the App Explorer">}}

4. In the **App Settings** dialog, in the **Configurations** tab, edit or create an authentication profile.
    If you have multiple sets of AWS credentials, or if you want to use both static and session credentials for different use cases, create separate authentication profiles for each set of credentials.
5. In the **Edit Configuration** dialog, in the **Constants** tab, click **New** to add the constants required for the configuration.
6. In the **Select Constants** dialog, find and expand the **AmazonDynamoDBConnector** > **ConnectionDetails** section.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-dynamodb/credentials.png" alt="The SessionCredentials and StaticCredentials items in the ConnectionDetails section">}}

7. Depending on your selected authentication type, configure the required parameters for the **StaticCredentials** or **SessionCredentials**.

    | Credentials type | Constant | Value |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Any | **UseStaticCredentials** | **true** if you want to use static credentials, or **false** for session credentials |
    | **StaticCredentials** | **AccessKey** | Access key ID [created in IAM](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites)  |
    | **StaticCredentials** | **SecretKey** | Secret key [created in IAM](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Role ARN** | [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the AWS role that the connector should assume |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Profile ARN** | ARN of the profile [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Trust Anchor ARN** | ARN of the trust anchor [created in IAM Roles Anywhere](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/#prerequisites) |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Client Certificate Identifier** | The **Client Certificate Pin** visible in the **Outgoing Certificates** section on the **Network** tab in the Mendix Cloud environment |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Duration** | Duration for which the session token should be valid; after the duration passes, the validity of the session credentials expires |
    | **SessionCredentials** | **Session Name** | An identifier for the session |

### 3.2 Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After you configure the authentication profile for Amazon DynamoDB, you can implement the functions of the connector by using the provided activities in microflows. For example, to list all Amazon DynamoDB tables for a specific region, implement the [ListTables](#list-tables) activity by doing the following steps:

1. In the **App Explorer**, find and open the domain model for your app.
2. Right-click on the working area of the domain model, and then click **Add entity**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-dynamodb/addentity.png" alt="Adding a new entity to the domain model">}}

3. Open the new entity by double-clicking on it.
4. Enter a name for the entity, for example, `DBTable`.
5. In the **Attributes** section, click **New**, and then configure the attribute in the following way:
    * **Name** - A unique name for the attribute, for example, `TableName`
    * **Type** - **String**

    The parameters that you need to configure depend on the contents of the response that an activity expects. The **ListTables** activity used in this example only expects the database table name as a response. Other activities require different parameters. For more information, see [Activities](#activities).
6. In the **App Explorer**, right-click on the name of your module, and then click **Add microflow**.
    
    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-dynamodb/addmicroflow.png" alt="Adding a microflow">}}

## 4 Technical Reference

To help you work with the Amazon DynamoDB connector, the following sections of this document list the available entities, enumerations, and activities that you can use in your application.

### 4.1 Domain Model {#domain-model}

The domain model is a data model that describes the information in your application domain in an abstract way. For more information, see [Domain Model](/refguide/domain-model/).

The entities in the table below describe all generalizations. These are reused by the different models for the specific microflow activities or for storing connection details.

Each item contains a list of key-value pairs, which represent the attributes inside a row of a table. |
| `Item` | | This generalization entity holds information of items inside Amazon DynamoDB. Each item represents a row in a table. Each item at least has one `KeyValue` object. |
| `KeyValueLong` | | This generalization entity holds information for a key-value pair for a given `Item`. The attribute it contains is `LongValue`, which is a numeric representation of value in a key-value pair. |
| `KeyValueDecimal` | | This generalization entity holds information for a key-value pair for a given `Item`. The attribute it contains is `DecimalValue`, which is a numeric representation of value in a key-value pair. |
| `KeyValueBoolean` | | This generalization entity holds information for a key-value pair for a given `Item`. The attribute it contains is BooleanValue, which is a Boolean representation of value in a key-value pair. |
| `KeyValueString` | | This generalization entity holds information for a key-value pair for a given `Item`. The attribute it contains is `StringValue`, which is a string representation of value in a key-value pair. |

#### 4.3.7 Put Item

The `PutItem` Amazon DynamoDB activity allows you to put and update an item in DynamoDB. It requires a valid AWS Region, `TableName`, and an `Item` object. If the table has only a partition key, then only one `KeyValue` object is required inside the `Item` object. If the table has both a partition and sort key, then two `KeyValue` objects are required.

The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `TableName (String)` | `RequestID (String)` |
| `Item (Object)` | |

#### 4.3.8 Get Item

The `GetItem` Amazon DynamoDB activity allows you to get an item from DynamoDB. It requires a valid AWS Region, a `TableName`, `IsConsistentRead`, and an `Item` object.

The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `TableName (String)`    | `Item (Object)` |
| `IsConsistentRead (Boolean)` | |
| `Item (Object)` |    |

This activity returns an `Item` object with objects from the following entities as shown in the table below:
