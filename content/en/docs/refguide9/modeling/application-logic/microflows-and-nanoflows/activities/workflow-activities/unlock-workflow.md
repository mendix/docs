This activity can only be used in **Microflows**.

This activity was introduced in Studio Pro [9.23.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/#9230).
{{% /alert %}}

## Introduction

The **Unlock workflow** activity can be used to unlock a [workflow](/refguide9/workflows/), i.e. a workflow definition. 
If the workflow is unlocked, new instances of the workflow can be created.
