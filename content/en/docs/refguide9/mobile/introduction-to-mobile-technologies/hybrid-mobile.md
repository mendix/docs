Hybrid mobile applications are web applications that run inside a native application. They can access device capabilities via JavaScript or by relying on the native application to provide the required functionality in native code.

Hybrid mobile apps are deprecated as of Mendix 9. This means that hybrid mobile apps are still supported in Mendix 9 but their usage is discouraged. Accordingly, the creation of new hybrid navigation profiles is disabled.
