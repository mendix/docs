## 1 Introduction

When working with the Mendix Platform, objects of entities are always being manipulated. This happens implicitly within [data widgets](data-widgets) on a page, or explicitly using activities in microflows and nanoflows.

The activities in this section of the microflow and nanoflow toolbox generally work on single objects, however **commit object(s)**, **delete object(s)**, and **retrieve** also work on lists of objects. For other activities which work with lists, see [List Activities](list-activities).

The activities described in this document are in the **Object Activities** section of the **Toolbox**:

The following are the object activities you can use in your microflow or nanoflow:

* [Cast object](cast-object) *(only in microflows)* – changes the type of object from a generalized object type to the specialized object type

* [Change object](change-object) – changes the members of an object

* [Commit objects(s)](committing-objects) – either stores objects of persistable entities in the database or stores objects of non-persistable entities in memory to allow them to be rolled back

* [Create object](create-object) – creates an object

* [Delete object(s)](deleting-objects) *(only in microflows)* – activity deletes one or more objects

* [Retrieve](retrieve) – gets one or more objects of an entity

* [Rollback object](rollback-object) – undoes uncommitted changes made to an object
