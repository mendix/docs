## 1 Introduction

ATS runs on top of Mendix 6. For details on system requirements, see [System Requirements](/refguide6/system-requirements). On-premises is a deployment option for ATS. 

## 2 Hardware Requirements & Hardware Sizing

### 2.1 Mendix Business Server

A recent CPU (minimal dual core, minimal 2 GHz), 4 GB of memory, and 10 GB of free disk space are recommended.

### 2.2 Database Server

A recent CPU (minimal dual core, minimal 2 GHz), 4 GB of memory, and 20 GB of free disk space are recommended.

### 2.3 Selenium Server(s)

 &#xfeff; | Standalone Server | Grid Hub | Grid Node 
-----|----|--------------|--------------
Minimal	| Recent CPU, 1GHz 2GB RAM	| Recent CPU, 1GHz 2GB RAM	| Recent CPU, 1GHz 2GB RAM
In addition per browser instance ยน	| 1 Core, 1GHz 500MB RAM | 200MHz 200MB RAM | 1 Core, 1GHz 500MB RAM

ยน This highly depends on a browser and on an application that is tested. The defined resources refer to medium-sized applications.

## 3 Software Requirements

This section describes the software requirements for running ATS.

### 3.1 Operating System

### 3.9 Browsers

The following browsers are supported to operate ATS (on their supported OS):

* Firefox 75 (ESR) or higher
* Google Chrome 22 or higher

## 4 Web Servers

A web server can be used to serve static content and proxy the dynamic content. A web server can be used to encrypt the communication using https.

Mansystems does not support web servers other than ad hoc assistance in getting the web server up and running and based on documented installations by Mendix. 

When using Nginx, we recommend to change the following settings in the server section:

* keepalive_timeout 65000
* client_max_body_size 64M
* proxy_read_timeout 180s
