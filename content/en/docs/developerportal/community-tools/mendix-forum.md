## 1 Introduction

The [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com) is where the Mendix community comes together to help each other with questions and answers and to propose ideas for improving the Mendix Platform.

The Mendix Forum is closely integrated with the [Mendix Profile](/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/) so that Mendix community members can see all the interesting and useful information about who is participating in the Mendix Forum. If someone clicks your name anywhere on the Mendix Forum, your Mendix Profile will open, so make sure you [set your profile to public](/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/#public) so everyone can see your details and progress!

There are two tabs available in the Mendix Forum: **Questions** and **Ideas**. On each tab, you can see the **Top contributors**, which lists the five Mendix community developers who have the most Mendix Forum points in the last 30 days.

## 2 Questions Tab {#questions-tab}

### 2.1 Questions Overview

On the **Questions** tab, you can see an overview of the questions that have been asked. Here is an example question:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-forum/questions_example.png" >}}

Each question has a descriptive title (**1**). Clicking the question title opens the specific [question and answers details page](#question-description-page) under the **Question** tab. After you click the question title, the dot ( • ) before the question title will disappear.

Each question specifies the following elements:

* The beginning of the question description (**2**), which is taken from the [question details and answers page](#question-description-page)
* The category (**3**)
  * This is set when asking a question (for details, see the [Asking Your Question](#asking-your-question) section)
  * When you click a category, the overview page will list questions in that category
* The tags applied to question (**4**) 
	* These are set when asking a question (for details, see the [Asking Your Question](#asking-your-question) section)
	* When you click a tag, the overview page will list questions with that same tag
* The number of votes (**5**), answers (**6**), and views (**7**) the question has received
* The name, avatar, and level of the Mendix community member who asked the question (**8**)
* When the question was created (**9**)

Hovering over the developer name brings up the profile card:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-forum/questions_profile_card.png"   width="200"  >}}

The profile card presents the Mendix points for the developer. Clicking the developer name on the card will bring you to their Mendix Profile.
