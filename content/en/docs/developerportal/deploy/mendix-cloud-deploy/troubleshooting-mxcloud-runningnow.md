## 1 Introduction

The **Running Now** dialog box can be accessed by clicking the **Show Running Now** button on the **General** tab of the [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) page. You can use it to monitor all actions that are currently running in your environment.

## 2 Running Now Navigation

This dialog box shows all actions currently running in the environment. It also shows some general information about each action.

The **Details** button lets you zoom in on a selected action:

You can also zoom in on a stack:

**Kill request** lets you try to stop the action. If successful, that leads to an error for the user executing the action.

## 3 Troubleshooting

You can use the information displayed in the **Running Now** dialog box for various purposes:

* If you want to shut down the application to perform maintenance, you can check **Running Now** to see if any actions are currently running in your application.
* If you fear two actions are blocking one another, you might be able to prevent the deadlock by stopping one of the two actions using the **Kill request** button.
* If you have a performance or memory problem, the listed actions (and their **Details** pages) might help you pinpoint the cause of the problem.
* If the above alone is not enough, you can combine the information on this page with the information on the **Cache** page, the [Logs](/developerportal/operate/logs/) page, and the [Metrics](/developerportal/operate/metrics/) page.
