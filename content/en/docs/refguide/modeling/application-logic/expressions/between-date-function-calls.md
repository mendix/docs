## Introduction

Between date function calls calculate the absolute difference between two dates. The difference will always be zero or a positive number.

## millisecondsBetween {#millisecondsBetween}

The `millisecondsBetween` function calculates the absolute difference between the input values in milliseconds.

## daysBetween {#daysBetween}

The `daysBetween` function calculates the absolute difference between the input values in days.

### Input Parameters

The input parameters are described in the table below:

| Value       | Type          |
