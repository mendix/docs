## 1 Introduction 

Mendix Assist refers to Mendix Platform capabilities that leverage [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence-ai/) and [machine learning (ML)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/machine-learning/) to assist developers in application development (via AI-assisted development (AIAD)). The purpose of Mendix Assist is to help development teams in modeling and delivering Mendix applications faster, more consistently, and with higher quality. 

Mendix Assist consists of different capabilities that act as a virtual co-developer bot, each specialized in a certain domain or stage of the application lifecycle development. Currently, Mendix Assist consists of the following virtual co-developer bots: 

* **MxAssist Logic Bot** – helps you model and configure your application logic in Mendix Studio Pro. It gives you contextualized recommendations on the next best activity based on the activities and parameters that are already configured in your application. It is built using machine learning analysis of over twelve million anonymized application logics built with Mendix. It uses deep learning to detect and learn the best practice patterns in Mendix. For more information, see [MxAssist Logic Bot](/refguide/mx-assist-logic-bot/).
* **MxAssist Best Practice Bot** – helps you inspect your app against Mendix development best practice detecting and pinpointing development anti-patterns and, in some cases, automatically fixing them. The bot is built using statistical analysis of thousands of anonymized Mendix apps to learn common anti-patterns as well as Mendix Expert Services best practices in the development of microflows, domain models, pages, security, etc. For more information, see [MxAssist Best Practice Bot](/refguide/mx-assist-performance-bot/).
* **Validation Assist** – helps you build validation microflows in a more automated way using pre-built expressions. For more information, see [Validation Assist](/refguide/validation-assist/).
* **MendixChat** (released in Studio Pro 10.6 as a beta feature) - a built-in chat interface powered by Generative AI in Studio Pro. Developers can ask questions about app development in Mendix, including how to apply concepts, best practices, and development patterns. For more information, see [MendixChat](/refguide/mendix-chat/).
