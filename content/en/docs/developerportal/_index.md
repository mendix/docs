## 1 What Is the Developer Portal?

The [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com) is one of the three key components of the Mendix Platform. The other two are [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling/) and [Mendix Studio](/studio/). In the Developer Portal, Mendix developers can collaborate, deploy, and manage their apps, and manage their company and users. 

The Developer Portal also offers open, well-defined APIs, enabling third-party developers to integrate their own widgets and plugins. For more information, see [API Documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/).

## 2 Navigation {#navigation}

To create a new app click **Create App**, which will open a page where you can choose a starting pointing for your new app:

On the right side of the top bar, you can search and access your [Mendix Profile](/developerportal/community-tools/mendix-profile/). You can also click the **+** icon to create a new app.

On the left side of the top bar, you open an access menu by clicking the **Switch to** menu:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/switcher.png"   width="300"  >}}

You can then access the following parts of the Mendix Platform:

* **Mendix Home** – the [My Apps](/developerportal/#my-apps) page
* [Studio](/studio/)
* **Get Studio Pro** – the [Studio Pro](/refguide/) download page in the [Mendix Marketplace](/appstore/)
* **Cloud**  – the [Nodes](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/) page, which shows a list of all the licensed Mendix Cloud nodes to which you have access
	* Clicking **Details** on this page opens the [Environments](/developerportal/deploy/environments/) page for the app that is deployed to a node
	* For details on the **Cluster Manager** option in the top bar, see [Creating a Private Cloud Cluster](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-cluster/)
* [Control Center](/developerportal/control-center/)
* [Marketplace](/appstore/)
* [Data Hub](/data-hub/)
* [Academy](https://academy.mendix.com/link/home)
* [Docs](https://docs.mendix.com/)

You can also quickly access specific [Recent Apps](#my-apps) you have used.

Click [Company Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz/) to communicate with colleagues, team members, stakeholders, and any other Mendix users in your company.

Click [Company Apps](/developerportal/#my-company-apps) to see all the apps created by members of your company.

If you want to turn on the old navigation/header, click your avatar and toggle **New Navigation** to **Off**.

## 3 My Apps {#my-apps}

The **My Apps** page shows you a summary of your apps:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/apps-tiles.jpg" alt="Apps tiles" >}}

**All** displays all the apps for which you are a [Team](/developerportal/collaborate/team/) member. Any apps you pin with the pin icon will appear in the **Pinned** tab. 

Click an app tile to see the app [Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz/).

Using the drop-down menu, you can choose to sort the apps in the following ways:

* **Most Recent** first
* Alphabetical order of **App Name**

By clicking the ellipsis (**…**) in the app tile, you can quickly perform a number of actions:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/quick-action-menu.jpg" alt="Quick actions menu for an app" >}}

The actions available depend on the app selected:

* **Edit in Mendix Studio**
* **Edit in Mendix Studio Pro**
* **Delete App** – allows you to delete your app, provided you are the only team member (you will be warned of the consequences and asked for confirmation before the app is deleted)

To go to the [licensed environments](/developerportal/deploy/environments/) of your deployed app, click the cloud icon in the lower-right corner of the app tile.

## 4 My Company's Apps & Buzz {#my-company-apps}

In the header, you can click links to see your **Company Apps** and **Company Buzz**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/company-links.png" >}}

On the **My Company's Apps** page, you will see all the apps created by members of your [company](/developerportal/control-center/#company).

You can also sort the order of the apps here.

If you click an app for which you are a team member, you will be taken to the app [Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz/).

If you click an app for which you are not an team member, you will see the app details:
