## 1 Introduction

App services are domain-focused and packaged business capabilities delivered in the form of APIs and associated UIs. As flexible building blocks that include out-of-the-box integration into the Mendix development experience, Mendix app services are designed to solve discrete business problems within the context of larger solutions. 

When you download an app service, it will go into the **App** > **Marketplace modules** folder.
