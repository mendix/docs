## 1 Introduction

The [Microsoft Teams Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/118391) app service enables sending messages and actionable message cards to a Microsoft Teams channel automatically. You can add and configure the app service in a microflow. Once the microflow that uses the app service is triggered, your app asynchronously sends out the message to the Microsoft Teams channel. 

This app service is an [add-on module](/refguide/consume-add-on-modules-and-solutions/).


### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

* Send messages to pre-configured channels in Microsoft Teams

* Let your Mendix app send an automated notification to a pre-configured channel, when an event occurs in your Mendix application (for example, your Mendix app can automatically send a message to a pre-configured channel whenever a ticket is raised on the support portal application)

* Let your Mendix app send an automated message to a pre-configured channel to trigger users to perform an action (for example, your Mendix app can automatically ask users to create a Jira ticket by sending them a message in a pre-configured channel)

### 1.2 Features

* Send HTML, markdown, or plain text messages
* Send Microsoft Teams actionable message cards

### 1.3 Prerequisites

* Your organization should allow you to use Webhooks in Microsoft Teams.
* The app service can only be used with Studio Pro 9 versions starting from [9.12.1](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.12/).

### 4.2 Sending Message to a Teams Channel

#### 4.2.1 Using Microflow

You can use the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity in a microflow to send messages to a Teams channel:

1.  From the toolbox, drag and drop the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity into your microflow.
    
    The following representative microflow contains activities with the required attributes, the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity, and a placeholder to capture the returned object.
    
    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/connector-in-microflow.png" >}}
    
2. Double-click the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity to open the **Microsoft Teams Connector** dialog box.

3.  Specify the following settings with expression syntax:
    1. Set the **webhookId** parameter to the **Webhook ID** generated in the Communication Services Console.
    2.  For **Message type**, select **Text** or **Card** from the drop-down list:
        
        *  If you want to send a message as plain text or in HTML or markdown formatting, select **Text**.
        
            {{% alert type="info" %}}Fore more information about HTML and markdown tags supported by Microsoft Teams, see [*Format Cards in Microsoft Teams*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format).{{% /alert %}}
          
        * If you want to use an actionable message card as a message, select **Card**.
        
            {{% alert type="info" %}}Fore more information about message cards, see [Building a Message Card](#build-message-card).{{% /alert %}}
       
    3.  For the **Message** parameter, set up the message content in the String format. Below is an example:
       
        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/html-message.png" >}}
        The example above will render in the Microsoft Teams channel like this:

        {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/html-output.png" >}}
       
    4. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.

{{% alert type="warning" %}}All parameters are mandatory. Setting any value to be empty or **none** will cause an error.{{% /alert %}}

After the **Microsoft Teams Connector** activity is configured, once the microflow that uses this activity is triggered, the app asynchronously sends out the message to the Microsoft Teams channel. When the message is sent successfully, the activity returns a **SendMessageReponse** object. The **SendMessageReponse** entity for this object comes with the module and is pre-defined:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/send-message-response-entity.png" >}}

* If the message is successfully sent, the value of the **SentMessage** attribute is `true`.
* If the message could not be sent, the value of the **SentMessage** attribute is `false`.
* The **Message** attribute contains the respective response message.

#### 4.2.2 Building a Message Card {#build-message-card}

Microsoft Teams supports [actionable message cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference). You can build a message card and send it to a Microsoft Teams channel using the Microsoft Teams connector. To build a message card, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the [Card Playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net/). This playground contains sample message cards. You can modify the JSON for any sample message card and view the corresponding generated message card on the fly.

2.  Edit a message card sample as follows:

    1. At the upper-right corner of the page, click **Select Sample** to open the drop-down list. 
    
    2. Below the **Legacy MesssageCard samples** category, select a sample message card.
    
       {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/sample-message-cards.png" >}}
    
       {{% alert type="info" %}}Do not select any sample card above the **Legacy MessageCard samples**. They are adaptive cards, which do not work with the Microsoft Teams connector.{{% /alert %}}
    
    3. Edit the sample message card. The preview of your message card is on the right side of the page. 

       Below is the basic structure of a message card and the corresponding fields in JSON:
    
       {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/card-json-structure.png" >}}
    
       The example above with **Add a comment action** expanded looks like this:

       {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/add-a-comment-expanded.png" >}}
    
       {{% alert type="info" %}}For more information about the design of a message card, see [*Design guidelines*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference#design-guidelines). {{% /alert %}}

## 5 Checking Statistics Using the Usage Dashboard {#statistics}

## 6 Troubleshooting

### 6.1 License

When you get the following pop-up window, then your license is invalid. Check if the configuration of your [LicenseSecret and LicenseKey](#obtain-keys) is correct.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/license-invalid-popup.png" >}}

### 6.2 Quota

When you get the following pop-up window, then your quota is used up. You can check your usage statistics on the [Usage dashboard](#statistics).

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/app-services/ms-teams-connector/quota-exhausted-popup.png" >}}

### 6.3 Waiting Time for Using Webhook URLs

If the app deployed in the sandbox goes into the sleep mode, after the app resumes, you may have to wait up to five minutes before you can use the latest-configured Webhook URL.

Although an app deployed to the licensed node would never go into the sleep node, you still need to wait for five minutes before you can use each newly-configured Webhook URL for the first time.
