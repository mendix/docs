The data view is a central component in Mendix applications. It is the starting point for showing the contents of exactly one object. If, for example, you want to show details of a single customer you would use a data view to do this. The data view typically contains a table with labels and input widgets like text boxes.

The list view is similar to the template grid. The list view shows a list of objects arranged vertically. Each object is shown using a template. During development, the object template is defined by placing a widget inside the list view's dropzone. The list of objects shown is determined by a data source.
