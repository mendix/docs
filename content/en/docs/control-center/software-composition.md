## Introduction

A Mendix app can consist of the Mendix Model (which includes pages, domain model, microflows, etc.), custom Java, and JavaScript. Additionally, it can use reusable components such as standard marketplace modules, widgets, Java libraries, npm packages, and the runtime version. These reusable components are dependencies, namely, components you are dependent on for your Mendix app to run.  

Over time, these dependencies can become deprecated, outdated, or vulnerable. Enterprises also have policies on which of these reusable components can or cannot be used based on support, license, etc. It is important to have an easily accessible, clear view of component dependencies through the development lifecycle in order to address any security finding raised by your admins or security teams.

To enable this, the **Software Composition** page in Control Center provides visibility into the component dependencies in each app environment. The components displayed here will be based on the [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](/refguide/sbom-generation/).

### Known Issues

After the creation of a deployment package, it may take up to a day for the **Software Composition** page to become visible. Mendix is working to improve the performance on this front.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To be able to see the software composition information, make sure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and the associated Software Composition capabilities are compatible with the following versions of Studio Pro: 9.24.26 and above, 10.6.12 and above, 10.12.3 and above. 

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}Make sure you upgrade to a compatible Studio Pro version to continue to use Software Composition. Previously supported Studio Pro versions (9.24.22 to 9.24.25, 10.6.9 to 10.6.11, 10.10.0 to 10.12.2, and 10.13) will no longer result in SBOM generation and visibility in Software Composition. Any historical data within Software Composition remains accessible regardless of the upgrade.{{% /alert %}}

* Software composition visibility is only possible for deployment packages created via the platform services. It is not available if you manually upload the locally-created deployment package. SBOMs are created behind the scenes for each deployment package. For more information, see [Create Deployment Package](/refguide/create-deployment-package-dialog/).

* You must be using free or licensed Mendix Cloud or Mendix Cloud Dedicated, or Mendix for Private Cloud. 

* If your deployment package was deployed before June 14, 2024, you must create and deploy a new deployment package in order to get the software composition information populated on this page.

### Software Composition Generation {#software-composition-generation}

Components are identified in the following manner:

First, when a new deployment package is created via the Mendix Portal with the compatible Mendix Runtime version, a software bill of material (SBOM) is generated along with it. The log details can be viewed by clicking **View build output** in the deployment package details in the Mendix Portal. For details on SBOM generation, see [SBOM Generation](/refguide/sbom-generation/).

The component dependencies for each non-expired, deployment package are available in the [Software Composition](/developerportal/deploy/software-composition/) page in **Apps**. 

## Overview {#overview}

On the **Overview** tab, you can see a list of all the deployed apps and their environments, if applicable.

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/software-composition/overview.png" >}}

Above the list, you can use the search box to search for information in the list. Next to the search box, you can filter apps by selecting the type of the cloud. You can click {{% icon name="office-sheet" %}}**Export all** on the right side above the list to export all the information in the list to an Excel file.

The list contains the following information:

* **App Name**: This is the name of the app.
* **Environment**: This is the name of the environment.
* **Runtime**: This shows the Mendix Runtime version.
* **Technical Contact**: This shows the Technical Contact of the app.
* **Target Cloud**: This shows the type of the cloud where the deployment package is deployed. Currently, only Mendix Free Cloud and Mendix Cloud (including Mendix Cloud Dedicated) are supported.
* Column customization ({{% icon name="view" %}}): You can customize the columns of the list by clicking the {{% icon name="view" %}} icon and adjusting the selection of the check boxes.
* **View details**: Click this opens the [Component Summary](#component-summary) page, if it is available. The **View details** button is grayed out when an SBOM is not available for the selected application environment. Ensure you are on a compatible runtime version and create a new deployment package in order to get component visibility here.

To export the information of selected items in the list to an Excel file, select the check boxes of the items in the list, and then click {{% icon name="office-sheet" %}} **Selection Export** that appears at the bottom of the page.

### Component Summary {#component-summary}

On the **Overview** tab, if you click **View Details** for an item in the list, the **Component Summary** page opens. This page shows the components of the selected app environment for your easy visual consumption.

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/software-composition/component-summary.png" >}}

On the top of the page, you can find the app name, the environment name, the Mendix Runtime version, the Technical Contact, and the type of the cloud where the deployment package is deployed.

For details on the information in the list and how to search, filter, and export information in the list, see the [All Components](#all-components) section.

#### Downloading the Software Bill of Materials

A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a *.json* file in the CycloneDX format. It contains a description about the Mendix app and the components (dependencies) put into it. For more information, see [SBOM Generation](/refguide/sbom-generation/).

On the upper-right corner of the **Component Summary** page, you can click {{% icon name="download-bottom" %}}**SBOM** to download the software bill of materials (SBOM). Different versions of Studio Pro support different component dependencies. For details on component dependencies supported per version, see the [Supported Features](/refguide/sbom-generation/#supported-features) section in *SBOM Generation*.

## All Components {#all-components}

The **All Components** tab gives an overview of all the unique components used across your app landscape.
