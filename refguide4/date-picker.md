A date picker can be used to display and/or edit a date value. It takes into account the language setting to display a localized calendar.

This date picker allows the end-user to set the birth date of the customer.

A date picker must be placed in a table cell within a data view or template grid and connected to an attribute of type Date. The connected attribute is shown in blue and between brackets inside the date picker.

## General Properties

### Date format (only for attributes of type DateTime, before version 4.1.0 only in web forms)

The date format determines whether the date part, the time part or both are shown. How the date and time parts are formatted depends on the localization of the user using the application.

Possible values: 'Date', 'Time', 'Date and time' and 'Custom'.

_Default value:_ Date

### Custom date format (only in web forms, only for attributes of type DateTime)

If you choose 'Custom' as the date format (see above) the custom date format determines the way date and/or time are formatted. The custom date format is a string that follows the rules in this table,

### Placeholder text (only in mobile forms)

The placeholder text is shown when no date has been selected yet. It can be used to give a hint to the user what kind of date should be entered. Note: placeholder texts do not work when a native date picker is available (iOS, Android >= 4.0).
