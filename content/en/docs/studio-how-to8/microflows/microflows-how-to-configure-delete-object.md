## 1 Introduction 

This how-to explains how you can configure a delete object action in Mendix Studio. 

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:

* configure the **Delete Object** action in a [list view](/studio8/page-editor-data-view-list-view/#list-view-properties)
* configure the **Delete Object** action in a [data view](/studio8/page-editor-data-view-list-view/#data-view-properties)

This how-to describes the following use case:  you would like to delete the customer's name from a list of customers. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You can configure the **Delete Object** on click action for such widgets as buttons or a static image. In this how-to, a **Delete** button is used as an example of a widget with **Delete Object** on click action. For more information, see the [Delete Object Action](/studio8/page-editor-widgets-events-section/#delete-object-action) section in *Events Section*.
{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Configuring the Domain Model and Creating a Page

To list customers' names and to show a more detailed information under the list, you need to create an entity *Customer*, add attributes *Name* and *Address* to it, and then create a page where you will list names of customers. 

To configure the domain model and create a page, do the following:

1. Open your [domain model](/studio8/domain-models/).
2. Create an entity *Customer*. For more information on how to create an entity, see the [Adding New Entities](/studio8/domain-models/) section in *Domain Models Overview*.
3. For the **Customer** entity, create an attribute (for more information on how to create an attribute, see the [Adding New Attributes](/studio8/domain-models/) section in *Domain Models Overview*) and do the following:<br/>

    1. Set the **Name** of the attribute to *Name*.<br/>
    1. Set the [Type](/studio8/domain-models-attributes/) to **String**.<br/>

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/name-attribute.png" >}}<br/>

    1. Click **Create** to add the new attribute.<br/>

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/customer-entity.png" >}}

4. Repeat step 3 to create an attribute *Address* of string type.
5. Now you need a page where customers' names will be listed. Create a blank page and name it *Customers*. For more information on creating pages, see the [Creating a New Page](/studio8/page-editor/) section in *Pages*.<br/>

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/create-page.png" >}}

A new blank page is created.

## 3 Configuring a Delete Object Action in a List View

Now you will configure a list view and will add a button with [**Delete Object** action](/studio8/page-editor-widgets-events-section/#delete-object-action) that deletes the corresponding customer when a user clicks the button. Do the following:

1. Open the page *Customers* that you have created.
2. In **Building Blocks** > **Lists** find **List 1**, drag it onto the page. This building block contains a list view in it by default.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/list-1.png" >}}

3. Now you need to configure the list view. Open the list view properties and do the following: <br/>

    1. Select **Database** as **Data Source**.<br/>
    1. Set **Entity** to **Customer**.<br/>

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/list-view-properties.png" >}} <br/>
        Now the list view is connected to the **Customer** entity. <br/>

4. Select the text *Name* and do the following in **Properties**:<br/>

    1. In **Content**, delete the text *Name*.<br/>
    1. Click **Add attribute** (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>) and select the **Name** attribute. <br/>

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/text-content.png" >}}<br/>
        Now the text widget is connected to the **Name** attribute, and will show you customers' names in a list.<br/>

5. Click the button displayed as an arrow and delete it.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/arrow-button.png" >}}

6. In **Toolbox** > **Widgets** > **Buttons** find **Delete Object**, drag it into the container that is left from the arrow button. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/container-for-the-delete-button.png" >}}

7. In **Properties** for the **Delete** button, you can see that the **On Click** action is set to **Delete Object** automatically, and caption is set to **Delete**, because the widget is preconfigured in Studio.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/delete-button-properties.png" >}}

You have created the page that lists customers' names. When an end-user clicks **Delete** in one of the lines, the customer who is selected in this line will be deleted from the app along with the customer's details. For more information, see the [Delete Object Action](/studio8/page-editor-widgets-events-section/#delete-object-action) section in *Events Section*.

## 4 Configuring a Delete Object Action in a Data View

You can also configure the [**Delete Object** action](/studio8/page-editor-widgets-events-section/#delete-object-action) in a data view. In this case **Delete Object** will delete the connected object. To configure the data view and the **Delete** button on your page, do the following:

1. On the page named *Customers*, open the **Layout Grid** properties (use a breadcrumb at the bottom of the screen to select the layout grid).

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/breadcrumb.png" >}}

2. In **Properties** > **Add Row**, click the button that adds a row below. You will use this row to place a data view there. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/add-row.png" >}}

3. In **Toolbox** > **Widgets** > **Data Containers**, find the data view widget, drag it inside the column (that was added together with a new row).

4. Now you need to configure the data view. In **Properties** of the data view, do the following: <br/>

    1. Set **Data Source** to **List widget**.<br/>
    1. Set **Widget** to **List View with entity Customer**. Now the data source for the data view is the list view that is placed on the same page.<br/>

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/data-view-list-widget.png" >}}

5. You need to fill the data view with data. In **Toolbox** >**Widgets** > **Typography**, select **Text**, drag it inside the data view. 

6. You will make a heading out of the **Text** widget you have just added. Open the **Properties** of the **Text** and do the following:<br/>

    1. In **Content**, delete the word *Text* and type *Customer Details*.<br/>
    1. Set **Render Mode** to **H4**. <br/>

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/text-heading4.png" >}}<br/>

7. Now you will add a text box to display details of the selected customer. In **Widgets** > **Input Elements**, select **Text Box**, drag it inside the data view content. 
8. Open the **Properties** of the **Text Box**, and in **Data Source**, set **Attribute** to **Name** (the label for the text box will be changed to **Name** automatically).  

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/text-box-name.png" >}}

9. Repeat step 7 to add one more **Text Box** to the page.
10. Open the **Properties** of the **Text Box**, and in **Data Source**, set **Attribute** to **Address** (the label for the text box will be changed to **Address** automatically).

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/text-box-address.png" >}}

11. In **Toolbox** > **Widgets** > **Buttons** find **Delete Object**, drag it inside the data view. 
12. The button is already preconfigured: its **On Click Action** is set to **Delete Object**, and **Caption** is set to **Delete**. But you will add some styling to it. Do the following:<br/>

    1. In the **General** section, set **Style** to **Danger**.<br/>
    1. In the **Design** section, set **Align Self** to **Right**.<br/>

You have configured the data view that will show you the customer's name and address once you select this customer in the list:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/configured-page.png" >}}

The workflow for the **Delete** button in the data view (the red **Delete** button) is the following:

1. An end-user selects a customer's name in the list.
2. The customer's details (name and address) are shown in the data view below. 
3. The user clicks **Delete**.
4. Whole customer's record is deleted.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to8/microflows/microflows-how-to-configure-delete-object/published-page-example.png" >}}

For more information on the delete object action, see the [Delete Object Action](/studio8/page-editor-widgets-events-section/#delete-object-action) section in *Events Section*.

Congratulations! You have configured **Delete** buttons in the list view and in the data view.
