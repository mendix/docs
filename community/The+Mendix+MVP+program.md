At Mendix we know that the impact of our community is huge. It is a vibrant and crucial part of the success of Mendix. With the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) program we want to recognize the loyal group of developers in the Mendix developer community for the ongoing contributions they deliver on the forum, to the App Store, the blog sites, etc.

With the MVP program we want to empower our MVPs and make them even more important and visible in the community by retaining the high level of knowledge of our top contributors and give them a closer view on the roadmap of Mendix.

## 1. Selection

Mendix will select a limited number of people who will receive the year-long MVP status, which will be awarded after a thorough review of their online and offline contributions to the Mendix developer community in the past year. There are a few simple rules:

*   MVPs may be selected based on a nomination that includes a motivation
    *   you may nominate yourself or someone else
*   Mendix will select MVPs twice a year (in January and July)
*   the title of MVP is valid for 1 year, until new MVPs are selected
    *   you may be re-elected in subsequent years, depending on your contributions.

## 2\. Profile

The Mendix MVPs represent the spirit of our community, are highly engaged (you basically can’t stay away from the forum, App Store, Meetups, etc.), interested in helping other members, and actively sharing their results. In four basic elements we describe our MVP recognition requirements:

*   <u>Active</u>: is highly active, accessible, and well known in our community. The MVP contributes on the forum every week (if not every day), frequently adds new App Store content, organizes meetups and/or writes blogs on Mendix topics
*   <u>Expert</u>: knows a lot about the Mendix platform itself and is a real Expert Developer
    *   answers more question then he/she asks
    *   has proven expertise / successful complex implementations
*   <u>Evangelist</u>: is a Mendix advocate, showing passion for developing Mendix solutions and able to think on an abstract level about developments within the software industry
*   <u>Leader</u>: represents the spirit of the community and can be an extra bridge between Mendix and the developer community. A creditable and independent thinker, not only within Mendix
    *   shares his/her exceptional passion, real-world knowledge, and technical expertise with the community and Mendix

A couple of things we look for in nominees when doing the selections for MVP:

*   basically can’t stay away from the forum and helping the community by providing answers on a daily basis
*   uploads several App Store items a year
*   is active on GitHub by helping the community solve issues on App Store content repositories
