The Mendix Cloud is the public cloud service and the default deployment option for Mendix applications.

Learn how to deploy your app, either in a Sandbox or to the Cloud. And go check out our AppCloudServices.

## Free App

Every app that you create from the Mendix Modeler or the Developer Portal will always get a Free App with one environment in the Mendix Cloud. This environment is called a Sandbox. 

## Node

A Free App can be upgraded to a licensed app with a node in the Mendix Cloud. A node has several environments and is hosted on Mendix Cloud V3 or Mendix Cloud V4. 

## Environment

A node has a minimum of two environments: production and acceptance. A test environment is the third optional environment. You can deploy your licensed app (that is linked to a node) to its environments.
