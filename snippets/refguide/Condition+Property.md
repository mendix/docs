#### Based on Attribute Value

When selected, this enables the widget while a particular attribute has a certain value. Only Boolean and enumeration attributes can be used for this purpose.

#### Based on Expression

<div class="alert alert-info">

Added in Mendix 7.1.

</div>

When selected, this enables the widget while a provided [expression](expressions) evaluates to true. The object of the containg data view is available inside an expression as a `$currentObject` variable.

Note that the expression is evaluated in the browser, and hence, we advise against using "secret" values (like access keys) in it. In particular, we disallow usages of [constants](constants). Also, client-side expressions currently do not support all the functions that are available in the microflows. Please refer to an autocomplete list to know what functions are supported in your version.
