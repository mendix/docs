{{% alert color="info" %}}[Machine learning model](/refguide9/machine-learning-kit/) support is currently in [Beta](/releasenotes/beta-features/), and is available in Studio Pro [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/) and above.{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

Studio Pro [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/) and above supports machine learning (ML) model integration in Mendix apps. Collectively called the *Machine Learning (ML) Kit*, this functionality allows Mendix developers to deploy a ML model built using common ML framework and language into the Mendix Runtime.

For a list of supported models, see the [Supported Frameworks and Libraries](/refguide9/machine-learning-kit/using-ml-kit/#supported-frameworks) section in *Using ML Kit*.

## 2 Adding a ML Mapping to Your App

To add a ML model to your app, do the following:

1. Convert your model to ONNX format (see the [Converting Your Model to ONNX](/refguide9/machine-learning-kit/using-ml-kit/#convert-ml-model) section in *Using ML Kit*).
2. Right-click on the module where you would like to add the mapping, and go to **Add other > ML model mapping**.
3. Click **Import model** to import your ONNX file.
