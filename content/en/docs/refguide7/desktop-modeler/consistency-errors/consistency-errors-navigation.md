## 1 Introduction 

In this document, we will explain how to solve the most common consistency errors that can occur when configuring navigation in the Desktop Modeler. 

An example of a consistency error is when you set a page that has a data view as a menu item. 

## 2 Navigation Consistency Errors 

The most common errors you can come across when configuring a navigation item are described in the table below:

| Text in the Checks Panel                                     | Cause of an Error                                            | Way to Fix                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The selected page {Name of the page} expects an object of type {type of object}, which is not available here. | You have set a page that expects an object to be passed to it (a page with a data view and a **Context** data source) as a menu item. | Pass an object to the page by changing the **On click** property  of the menu item from **Show a page** to **Create object**. For more information, see section [2.1 Error Fix When the Selected Page Expects an Object](#page-expects-an-object) |
| The selected {Name of the page} expects an object of type {type of object} and cannot be used as a home page. Change the page or use a microflow to provide the page with an object. | You have set a page that expects an object to be passed to it (for example, a page with a data view) as a home page. But a home page has no object that is passed to it, because it is the starting point of a flow. | You can use a microflow as the home page that will open the preferred page and pass a specific object to the home page. For more information, see section [2.2 Error Fix When the Selected Home Page Expects an Object](#home-page-expects-an-object) |

### 2.1 Error Fix When the Selected Page Expects an Object {#page-expects-an-object}

When you set a page with a data view as a menu item, you get a consistency error, because the page expects an object to be passed to it. 

For example, you have created a menu item called **Program** for a **Responsive** [profile](/refguide7/navigation-profile/). This menu item opens the **Program** page. However, the **Program** page has a data view on it and expects a *ProgramItem* object to be passed to it, so that it can show the program details of a specific *ProgramItem* on the page. As a result, you get a consistency error, as no object is passed to this page from the navigation.

To fix the error, you can create an object and pass it to the page. Do the following:

1. Open the navigation for the responsive profile.

2. Open properties of the **Program** menu item, and do the following: <br/>

    1. Change the **On click** property from **Show a page** to **Create object**. <br/>

    1. Set **ProgramItem** as **Entity (path)**. <br/>

    1. Set **Program** as **On click page**. <br/>

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide7/desktop-modeler/consistency-errors/consistency-errors-navigation/dm-menu-item-properties.png" alt="Menu Item Properties" class="no-border" >}}<br/>

Now when a user clicks the menu item, a new *ProgramItem* object will be created and passed to the page.

### 2.2. Error Fix When the Selected Home Page Expects an Object {#home-page-expects-an-object}

If you set a page that expects an object to be passed to it as a home page for a [navigation profile](/refguide7/navigation-profile/), you will get a consistency error.

Let us study an example: you have added a data view that expects an object of type *Customer* to the home page of the responsive profile, and you get a consistency error. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide7/desktop-modeler/consistency-errors/consistency-errors-navigation/dm-home-page-error.png" alt="Home Page Error" class="no-border" >}}

You can fix this error by creating a microflow that will that will create a new *Customer* object and pass it to the page. Do the following:

1. Open the responsive navigation profile.

2. In **Default home page field** click **Select**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide7/desktop-modeler/consistency-errors/consistency-errors-navigation/dm-default-home-page-field.png" alt="Default Home Page Setting" class="no-border" >}}

3. In the **Select Navigation Target** dialog window, click **New**, then select **Create Microflow**.

4. Name the microflow *ACT_Open_HomePage*.

5. Open the created microflow, add a **Create Object** activity to it 

6. For the **Create Object** activity, set **Entity** to **Customer**. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide7/desktop-modeler/consistency-errors/consistency-errors-navigation/dm-create-object-properties.png" alt="Create Object Properties" class="no-border" >}}

7. Add Show Page activity to the microflow and do the following in the **Show Page** pop-up dialog:<br/>

    1. Set **Object to pass** to **NewCustomer**.<br/>

    1. Set **Page** to **Home**.

Now the new object of type *Customer* will be created and passed to the home page.
