## 1 Introduction

The purpose of the Partner Profile is to provide the Mendix community and customers with a transparent overview of each partner company's knowledge, skills, experience, reviews, and culture. The profile is a simple and clear way for each partner to present themselves through an aggregated view of the developers in the organization, including the number of certified developers. It is also possible to add projects, customer reviews, contact information, a company video, and a description to each profile.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Set up and edit the Mendix Partner Profile
* Add projects to the profile
* Add developers to the profile

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Have a Community Profile (register [here](https://www.mendix.com/try-now/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=signup) and see [How to Set Up Your Community Profile](how-to-set-up-your-profile) for more information)

## 3 Logging In to the Partner Profile

To log in to the Partner Profile, edit it, and make it public, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your own Mendix Community Profile [here](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/openid/login?immediate=true&continuation=link/ownprofile/). Now Mendix knows who you are and which company is attached to your account.
2. At the top of your Community Profile, you will see your role and comapny (for example, "Senior Developer at **Finaps**"). When your company is a partner, the company name is clickable. Click your company name to go to its Partner Profile. 
3.  If you are authorized as a Partner Profile Editor, click **Edit Partner Profile** to edit the profile:

    ![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/edit-partner-profile.png)

    If you are not authorized to edit the profile but your colleagues are, a list with their email addresses is shown. To gain access to editing the profile, you can contact them so that they can add you as an editor (for details, see [9 Changing the Profile Editor](#editors)). If none of your colleagues are authorized, click **Feedback** on the right side of the screen and submit a feedback item to gain access.<br>

4.  Once you are in edit mode, click this icon to edit each field of the Partner Profile:

    ![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/icon.png)
    
    For details about editing, start with [5 Editing the Overview](#editing).<br>
    
5.  After you have finished editing, you can set the profile to public so that the Mendix community and customers can view it. To do this, simply click **View Public Profile**:

### 4.2 Capability Tracks<a name="capability"></a>

The header also displays whether the company is **Authorized**, **Expert**, or **Professional**. These capability tracks are defined as follows:

* **Authorized** — this type of partner has qualified and certified resources to support customers with Mendix initiatives 
* **Professional** — this type of partner can successfully deliver complex mission-critical Mendix applications and solutions for businesses
* **Expert** — this type of partner can support an enterprise in its successful positioning and adoption of the Mendix platform with all elements of the Mendix "4 P's" (portfolio, people, process, and platform; for details, see [How to Implement Bimodal IT: Focus on the 4 P’s](https://www.mendix.com/blog/how-to-implement-bimodal-it-focus-on-the-4-ps/))

These capability tracks are defined through an assessment of your company's developer certification levels, delivery expertise, and delivery references. For more information, please contact your Mendix Customer Success Manager.

## 7 Editing Team Members<a name="team"></a>

This section presents information on adding the most valuable assets of your company: your certified Mendix developers. Before you can add a developer to the Partner Profile, their Community Profile needs to be set to public (for details on how to do this, see [How to Set Up Your Community Profile](how-to-set-up-your-profile).

To add developers to the Partner Profile, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the **Developers** tab, where all the certified Mendix developers in your company are shown:

    ![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/team-members.png)

    You can use the **Sort by**, **Search**, and **Certification Level** features to find a specific team member.

2.  Select the active team members within your organization whose certifications you want to be visible on your Partner Profile by clicking **Add to profile**. The certification of each developer added to the profile will be visible in the statistics in the profile header, where numbers for **Rapid Developers**, **Advanced Developers**, **Expert Developers**, total **Mx Developers** (all developers added to the profile), and total **Mx Developers** (all existing developers) are displayed.

    Only the certifications and points of the added developers will be counted in the Partner Profile. The highest rank of certification will be added to the overview.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

Make sure you offboard the developers who no longer work at your company through the company administration in the Mendix platform. These former employees will still be visible in the overview. It is important that you deactivate these developers in the Developers Portal so that they don’t have access to projects.

## 8 Editing Testimonials

On the **Testimonials** tab, all the testimonials on your company and projects are available. These testimonials are approved by your company's Profile Editor before they are displayed on the profile. 

You can do further editing to the testimonials with the following buttons:

![](attachments/how-to-set-up-your-partner-profile/testimonials.png)

* **Edit** – opens the testimonial editor, where you can edit details of the testimonial

    {{% alert type="warning" %}}
    Providing accurate testimonials is an important part of participating in the Mendix community, as is respecting the testimonials that have been given. So, while you are able to edit the details of a testimonial about your company, please respect the original intent of the writer of a testimonial that has already been approved by your company's Profile Editor.
    {{% /alert %}}

* **Delete** – deletes the testimonial
* **Show on profile** – displays the testimonial on your company's Partner Profile

## 10 Sorting on the Partners Overview Page

The [Meet our partners page](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/openid/login?immediate=true&continuation=link/partneroverview) presents all the partners in the Mendix community. The sorting is based on a combination of the following KPIs:
