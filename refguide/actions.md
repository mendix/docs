Provides the actual microflow actions of the app service. Note that once an app service version is set to Consumable, its parameters and return type are no longer editable as they are part of the app service contract.

In the General tab, you can set the microflow that corresponds to the action. When the microflow is set, the Parameters tab will be filled automatically.

An action page has the following tabs:
