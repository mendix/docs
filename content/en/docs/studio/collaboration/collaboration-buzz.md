## 1 Introduction 

Via the **Buzz** tab, you can collaborate on your app with team members â€“ leave comments  or create feedback items on pages, microflows, the domain model, or a navigation document. With such in-context commenting it is easy to communicate clearly and plan your future work. 

Comments from Studio Buzz are automatically posted in [App Buzz](/developerportal/collaborate/buzz/#app-buzz) in the Developer Portal giving your team members an opportunity to respond to comments both in Studio and the Developer Portal.
