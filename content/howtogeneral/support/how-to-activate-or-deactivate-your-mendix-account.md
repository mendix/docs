## 1 Introduction

This document will explain how to create and deactivate your Mendix account (MxID). It contains a checklist of things to keep in mind of what to do with your Mendix account when you **leave a company or move to another company**.

Your MxID can have several [roles](/developerportal/general/roles) within the Mendix Platform.

## 2 Deactivate Your Mendix Account

Make sure that your MxID has **no roles in your company** by following these steps:

### 2.1 Company roles

If you have the **Company Admin** and/or the **Company Contact** company roles, you should follow these steps:

1. Add another Company Admin.
2. If you are a Company Contact, you should make someone else the Company Contact.
3. Remove yourself as a Company Admin.

For more information, see [Manage Company Roles and App Roles](/developerportal/howto/change-roles).

### 2.2 App roles

If you are a **Technical Contact**, an **App Contact** or an  **App Team Member**, you should follow different steps:

* **Technical Contact** or **App Contact**



* **App Team Member**



### 2.3 Support tickets

You can also be involved in unsolved support tickets.

Make sure that your MxID has **no roles in your company** by following these steps:

1. Log in to the [Developer Portal](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com).
2. Leave any projects of which you are a team member.
3. If you are a Company Admin, make someone else Company Admin.
4. If you are a Company Member, Technical Contact or Project Contact, ask your Company Admin to remove these roles.
5. If you do not have any of these roles your Company Admin can deactivate your account.

This means that you won't be able to access the Mendix Platform any more.
