## Introduction

Microflows and nanoflows allow you to express the logic of your application. They can perform actions such as creating and updating objects, showing pages, and making choices. It is a visual way of expressing what traditionally ends up in textual program code.

Microflows run in the runtime server and can therefore not be used in offline apps, while nanoflows run directly on the browser/device and can be used in an offline app. Furthermore, most of the actions in nanoflows run directly on the device, so there is also a speed benefit for logic which does not need access to the server.
