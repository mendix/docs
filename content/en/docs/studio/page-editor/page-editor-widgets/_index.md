## 1 Introduction

Widgets are single user-interface elements that can be configured. Examples of widgets can be a container, a drop-down menu, or different kinds of buttons.

Widgets in Studio are grouped by category and can be classified by their origin.

## 2 Viewing Widgets

To view widgets in Mendix Studio, do the following:

1. Click the **Pages** icon in the left menu bar.
2. In the displayed list of app pages, select the page you want to open and click it.
3. In the **Toolbox** tab, **Widgets** are opened by default.

## 3 Quick Configuration of Widget Properties {#quick-config}

Quick configuration of properties is available for most of non-custom widgets. This means that their properties can be configured in a pop-up window when adding these widgets on a page. 

Once you drag and drop a widget, a small pop-up window appears next to it. You can set the properties that are necessary for the widget to function without resulting in [consistency errors](/studio/consistency-errors/) as well as other frequently used properties to help you configure the widget quickly. However, you can configure all properties from the **Properties** tab at all times. 

For example, quickly configuring the data source of a data grid helps you avoid consistency errors when previewing or publishing your app, and you can configure the rest of the properties later.

The pop-up window disappears once you start interacting with the page or the menu items, for example, if you start clicking elements on the page or if you open **Toolbox**, **Properties**, **Buzz**. To access the quick configuration pop-up window again, click the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the widget:

## 4 Widgets by Category {#widget-categories}

Widgets of Studio are divided into categories that you can see when you open the **Widgets** tab.

## 6 Adding the Marketplace Widgets

You can add the Marketplace widgets to your app by downloading them directly in the **Widgets** tab in Studio. These widgets are a subset of all widgets available in the Marketplace: you can only download the ones that are approved for use in Studio. You can also update them if an update is available.

To add an Marketplace widget, do the following:

1. Open the **Widgets** tab.
2. Do one of the following: <br />

    1. Find a category with the **View Marketplace widgets** option and click it.  <br />

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/page-editor/page-editor-widgets/view-app-store-widgets.png"   width="300"  >}}<br />

    1. Start typing the name of the category or of a specific widget in the **Search** field. <br />

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/page-editor/page-editor-widgets/slider.png" >}}

3. Click the cloud icon to download the widget and add it to your app.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio/page-editor/page-editor-widgets/app-store-download.png" >}}

The widget is now added to your app, you can simply drag it onto the page to use it. You can also view settings of this widget in the **App Settings**.  For more information on managing widgets in your app, see [Settings](/studio/settings/).

Some similar widgets are packaged together: downloading one of these widgets will cause a number of other widgets to be downloaded as well. For example, downloading a line chart will give you all chart widgets.
