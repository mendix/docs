## 2 Checking Useful Links Before Submitting a Request

Before submitting a new Mendix Support request, check these resources to make sure your question has not already been answered:

* [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendix.com)
* [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/)
* [Mendix Platform status](https://status.mendix.com)

If you cannot find the answer to your question on the Mendix Forum or in the Mendix documentation, you can submit a support request. The Mendix Support Portal will walk you through the ticket creation by asking for relevant information based on the type of request. 

## 3 Submitting a New Request {#submitting}

You can access the Mendix Support Portal at [support.mendix.com](https://support.mendix.com).

This is the basic information required for a ticket:

* A detailed description of the exact error
* A detailed description of the action that was performed when the error was received
* A description of the desired goal (optional)
* The affected app (for more information, see [How to Prepare Your App for Support](/developerportal/support/prepare-your-app/))

To submit a request with Mendix Support, follow these steps:

1. Click **Submit a request** in the upper-right corner of the portal.
2. Select an issue from the drop-down menu:

5. Make sure all your attachments have finished uploading before clicking **Next**.

The Mendix Support Portal will first suggest relevant documentation for you to read before you submit a request. Based on a complexity check, recommendations might be skipped to improve your experience. This complexity check takes your request priority and other factors into consideration.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/support/submit-support-request/recommendations.png" >}}

If investigating the documentation and searching the [Mendix Forum](https://forum.mendixcloud.com) does not help you solve your issue, you can submit the Mendix Support request.    

## 4 Request Priority {#request-priority}

You can select the priority that you feel the request should have. Please note the [SLA regulations](/developerportal/support/#sla) for this priority.

The priority is based on the combination of impact and urgency: 

| Impact  | Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| High    | A high-priority production issue with a high impact on the customer’s business, impacting (almost) all users. |
| Medium  | A production issue with intermediate impact on the customer’s business, impacting a group of users. |
| Low     | A trivial production issue with no impact on the customer’s business. |

| Urgency | Description |
| ------- | ------- |
| High    | The operational functionality is severely disrupted. |
| Medium  | The operational functionality is fairly disrupted. |
| Low     | The operational functionality is hardly disrupted. |

You can set the priority to the following levels:

* **Critical**
* **High**
* **Medium**
* **Low**

The [ticket priority](/developerportal/support/ticket-priority/) that Mendix Support validates is based on this matrix:

### 5.2 Requirements for Security Support Tickets{#security-tickets}

If you are reporting a security finding or other security-related issue, for example a warning issued by a scanning tool, please follow these steps to ensure your ticket is dealt with as efficiently as possible.

1. Ensure you are using one of:
    * the current major version of Mendix, preferably an [MTS](/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/#mts) minor version as these continue to get security updates. 
    * the [LTS](/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/#lts) version of a previous major version which has not reached end of support.
1. If the security finding is in a marketplace component
    1. check that it is platform supported — community-supported components are not supported by Mendix support.
    1. ensure the component is up to date.
1. Review the [Frequently Asked Questions - Security](/developerportal/support/security-findings-faq/) document so see if your finding is described there. Follow instructions there for mitigating your finding, including updating and cleaning up Java libraries. If the finding is addressed there as not having any security implications for your app it is unlikely that raising a ticket will give you more information.
1. If the issue has been reported by a scanning tool, please check that the results are not caused by factors outside the Mendix app (for example, tool settings or network traffic routing issues).
1. Include the following information:
    * A description of the issue found — please submit only one finding per support ticket.
    * Where the issue was found — for example, which url, which Mendix version, the app id?
    * How the issue was found — for example, was it from scanning an app and, if so, which tool was used?
    * A copy of an app containing the reported issue — see [How To Export A Mendix App Package](/refguide/export-app-package-dialog/) for instructions on creating an app package.
    * An actual exploitation scenario, if possible, including steps showing how to reproduce and exploit a vulnerability.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Mendix Support will only accept security findings for the Mendix platform. This includes the Mendix runtime, any platform-supported components, and Mendix applications provided to support you to design, develop, deploy, and monitor your apps and Mendix applications used for managing your users and resources. Mendix Support will not look into security findings related to our marketing websites.
