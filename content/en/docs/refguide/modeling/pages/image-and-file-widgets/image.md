## 1 Introduction

The **Static image** widget can be used to show a static image on a page, layout, or snippet.

For example, you can configure an image clicking which a page with customer details opens:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/pages/image-and-file-widgets/image/image-example.png" alt="Image Example" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

If you want to dynamically show different images based on data, you need to add [dynamic image](/refguide/image-viewer/) on your page.

{{% /alert %}}

## 2 Properties

An example of static image properties is represented in the image below:
