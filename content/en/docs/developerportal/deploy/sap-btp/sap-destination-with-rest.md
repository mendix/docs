## 1 Introduction

The [SAP Destination Service](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/sap-destination-service/) is part of the [OData Connector for SAP solutions](/appstore/modules/sap/sap-odata-connector/) and enables OData calls to be made using SAP destinations configured on SAP Business Technology Platform ([SAP BTP](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/)). However, you can also use the destination information provided by the [SAP Destination Service](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/sap-destination-service/) to make calls to non-OData services using Mendix native actions for consuming REST and SOAP.

This document describes how to configure a REST or SOAP call to use the configuration obtained from the [SAP Destination Service](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/sap-destination-service/).

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Have a Mendix app which can be deployed to SAP BTP
* Configured a **PrincipalPropagation** destination to an on-premises REST or SOAP service in your SAP BTP account; For more information, see [SAP Destination Service](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/sap-destination-service/)
* Imported an [OData Connector for SAP solutions](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/74525) version higher than 4.0.0 into your app

## 3 Writing Your Microflow

In your microflow which is making a REST or SOAP call, perform a **Get Destination** action before the REST or SOAP call. This needs to use the Destination Name which is configured in a Destination on SAP BTP.

The **Get Destination** action returns a **Destination** object. This is named as *DestinationObject* in the above example, and is used to configure the subsequent REST or SOAP call.

The Destination object has the properties shown in the image below:

### 3.1 Configuring a REST Call

Configuring a REST call needs following tab entries:

#### 3.1.1 General Tab

The following entries are required in the **General** tab:

|Entry|Description
|-----|-----|
|Location|$DestinationObject/Url followed by any additional parameters|
|Proxy configuration|Override|
|Use proxy|true|
|Host|$DestinationObject/ProxyHost|
|Port|$DestinationObject/ProxyPort|
|Username|$DestinationObject/SapConnectivityProxyCredentials|
|Password|empty|

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/sap-destination-with-rest/rest-general.png" alt="REST general tab" class="no-border" >}}

#### 3.1.2 HTTP Headers Tab

The HTTP Headers do the following:

* Authenticate the app to perform the action via the connectivity service
* Authenticate the app to the correct Shared Service Center (SSC) location
* Authenticate the user to access the endpoint defined by the destination
* Request to return the data in JSON format

|Key|Value|
|---|---|
|SAP-Connectivity-Authentication|$DestinationObject/SapConnectivityAuthentication|
|SAP-Connectivity-SCC-Location_ID|$DestinationObject/SapConnectivitySccLocationId|
|Proxy-Authorization|'Bearer ' + $DestinationObject/SapConnectivityProxyCredentials|
|Accept|'application/json'|

### 3.2 Configuring a SOAP Call

Configuring a SOAP call needs following tab entries:

#### 3.2.1 Operation Tab

The following entries are required in the **Operation** tab:

|Entry|Description
|-----|-----|
|Override location|*Checked*|
|Location|$DestinationObject/Url|
|Proxy configuration|Override|
|Use proxy|true|
|Host|$DestinationObject/ProxyHost|
|Port|$DestinationObject/ProxyPort|
|Username|$DestinationObject/SapConnectivityProxyCredentials|
|Password|empty|

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/deploy/sap-destination-with-rest/web-service-general.png" alt="SOAP web service general tab" class="no-border" >}}

#### 3.2.2 HTTP Headers Tab

The same HTTP Headers are required as for a REST call. They do the following:

* Authenticate the app to perform the action via the Connectivity service
* Authenticate the app to the correct SSC Location
* Authenticate the user to access the endpoint defined by the destination
* Request to return the data in JSON format

|Key|Value|
|---|---|
|SAP-Connectivity-Authentication|$DestinationObject/SapConnectivityAuthentication|
|SAP-Connectivity-SCC-Location_ID|$DestinationObject/SapConnectivitySccLocationId|
|Proxy-Authorization|'Bearer ' + $DestinationObject/SapConnectivityProxyCredentials|
|Accept|'application/json'|
