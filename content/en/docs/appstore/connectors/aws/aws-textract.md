## 1 Introduction

The [Amazon Textract](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/205646) connector provides a way for you to enrich your Mendix app with the capability to extract text, handwriting and data from documents by implementing [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/).

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Amazon Textract helps improve your app by giving you the tools to extract data from documents in a structured manner. For example, you can use it to extract business data from handwritten documents, or patient data from intake forms.

### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The Amazon Textract connector requires Mendix Studio Pro 9.18.0 or above.

To authenticate with Amazon Web Service (AWS), you must also install and configure the [AWS authentication connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333). From Amazon Textract Connector version 2.0.0 on, AWS Authentication 3.0.0 or newer is required. For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Installation

Follow the instructions in [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/overview/use-content/) to import the Amazon Textract connector into your app.

## 3 Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonTextractConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon Textract. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### 3.1 Configuring AWS Authentication

In order to use the Amazon Textract service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

As of version 3.0.0 of the [AWS Authentication Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333), all the resources and logic required to set up authentication are centralized inside the AWS Authentication Connector module. 

The AWS Authentication Connector supports both **static credentials** and **temporary credentials**. For more information and detailed instructions please refer to the [AWS Authentication Connector documentation page](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).
    
### 3.2 Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After setting up the authentication, to analyze a document, implement the [AnalyzeDocument](#analyzedocument) activity by doing the following steps:

1. In the **Domain Model**, right-click on the work area, and then click **Add entity**.
2. Enter a name for your entity, for example, *Document*, and then click **OK**.
3. Double-click the **Document** entity, select the generalization **FileDocument**, and then click **OK**.
4. In the **Document** entity, find the **Access rules** tab.
5. Create new access rules by doing the following steps:

It contains the part of the responses that are shared between those actions. Most importantly, it has a list of type `DocumentAnalysisBlock` associated. A spcialization of this object should be used as an input parameter of the `AbstractDocumentAnalysisResponse_ProcessResults` microflow. This way, the responses from both the `AnalyzeDocument` and the `GetDocumentAnalysis` actions can be used by as input parameters.|
| `DocumentAnalysisBlock` | This entity is a specialization of the `Block` entity and holds the blocks returned by `AnalyzeDocument` and the `GetDocumentAnalysis` actions. |

### 4.3 Activities {#activities}

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow. For the Amazon Textract connector, they represent actions such as analyzing a document or expense. For more information, see [Activities](/refguide/activities/).

To help you work with multi-page PDF files, you can use the `JA_SplitPdfPages` helper action to split a PDF File with multiple pages into a list of single-page PDFs. The action also supports extracting only a subset of the pages.

You can use the action for use cases such as the following:

* Splitting a two-pager PDF into two one-pagers and using the synchronous `AnalyzeDocument` action on both. 
* Removing a cover page that does not contain information of interest from a document.
* When working with a large PDF file, extracting a small subset of pages (for example, only pages 10-12), which contain the information to analyse. 

#### 4.3.1 AnalyzeDocument {#analyzedocument}

The `AnalyzeDocument` Amazon Textract action allows you to analyze documents and extract information from them. It requires a valid AWS region, a `AnalyzeDocumentRequest` object and a specialized `System.FileDocument` object in PNG, JPEG, PDF, or TIFF format.
It additionally requires at least one `AnalyzeDocFeatureType` object. If the Feature Type **QUERIES** is part of the request, it additionally requires a `AnalyzeDocRequestQuery` object.

The current version of the Amazon Textract Connector support the following Feature Types: TABLES, FORMS, QUERIES and SIGNATURES. Adding the Feature Type LAYOUT to the request is currently not supported and can cause errors. 

Additionally, you can use the `AbstractDocumentAnalysisResponse_ProcessResults` sub-flow. This will process the response from Amazon Textract into the specialized `BlockItem` model.
