## 1 Introduction

The Catalog makes it easy to consume data sources within your company's ecosystem.

Common tasks for users who want to consume data sources from the Catalog include the following:

* Understanding data source [authentication](/catalog/register/register-data/#authentication) set by publishing developers
* Using the [Integration Pane](/refguide/integration-pane/)
* Understanding how sources are related in the [Landscape](/data-hub/data-hub-landscape/)

For an overview on consuming data sources, see [Consume Registered Assets](/catalog/consume/).
