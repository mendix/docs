## 1 Introduction

{{% alert type="warning" %}}The navigation tree widget is not supported on native mobile pages.{{% /alert %}}

The navigation tree widget shows a configured menu in the form of a tree. Items can have sub-items, in which case the main item can be expanded. The menu structure of the navigation tree can have three levels. In the end, a [menu item](menu#menu-item) points to either the page or the microflow that will be opened or started when the item is clicked.
