## 1 Introduction

A published REST resource is part of a [published REST service](/refguide7/published-rest-service/) and represents a collection of items on which one or more [operations](/refguide7/published-rest-operation/) can be defined.

You can generate a published REST resource from an entity in your domain model. See [Generate a Published REST resource](/refguide7/generate-rest-resource/).

## 2 General

### <a name="name"></a>2.1 Resource Name

The resource name uniquely identifies the resource in the [service](/refguide7/published-rest-service/). It is part of the location of the operations, so it cannot contain spaces or special characters.

## <a name="public-documentation"></a>2.2 Public Documentation

The public documentation is used in the service's [OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation page](/refguide7/published-rest-services/#interactive-documentation). You can use [GitHub-flavored markdown](/refguide7/gfm-syntax/) for rich text.
