## 1 Introduction

The **Delete external object** activity can be used to delete an external object. It sends a DELETE request to the publishing app.

### 1.1 Entity Access

When the microflow has **Apply entity access** set to **Yes**, only users with *delete* entity access can execute this activity. Users without *delete* entity access will see an error message.

## 2 Activity Properties

To manage the properties of the activity, double click the **Delete external object** activity, or right-click the activity and select **Properties**. 

Single-clicking on the activity displays the properties in the **Properties** pane.

### 2.1 Object

Choose a variable that contains a single deletable external object.

### 2.2 Refresh in Client

This setting defines how changes are reflected in the pages presented to the end-user. The default for this setting is *No*.

## 3 After the Activity

After this activity, the `$latestHttpResponse` variable (of the [HttpResponse](/refguide/http-request-and-response-entities/#http-response) type) is available to inspect the response returned by the service.
