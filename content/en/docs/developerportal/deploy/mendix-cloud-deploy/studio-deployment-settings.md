## 1 Introduction

If you have a licensed app in the Mendix Cloud which you want to deploy directly to an environment, you need to select a target environment where Mendix Studio and Mendix Studio Pro will deploy your app when you click **Publish** (for Studio) or **Deploy to Licensed Cloud Node** (for Studio Pro). For more information on licensed apps and environments, see [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/) and [Environments](/developerportal/deploy/environments/).

By default the target environment is set to *Build Only*, which means that your app will not be deployed directly to an environment from Studio Pro, and you will receive an error **No target selected** if you publish from Studio.

When you deploy to a target environment from Mendix Studio Pro, the deployment will also restart the target environment.

    {{% alert color="info" %}}If you do not want to deploy your app to an environment automatically from Studio Pro, choose the option **Build Only**. This will place your MDA in the **Deployment Package Repository** and you can deploy it from within the Developer Portal.<br /><br />If you choose **Build Only**, you will not be able to publish your app from Studio, but will get an error **No target selected**.{{% /alert %}}

4. Click **Save**.

You have selected the target environment and can now deploy your app to that environment from either Studio or Studio Pro.

You can see whether an environment is the target for Studio and Studio Pro from the **General** tab of the [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) page for the environment.
