### New Features

* We added the **On change behavior** property to the **Text area** widget, which enables selecting how **On change** is handled.
* We added support for one-way navigable associations for users working with OData and [external entities](/refguide/external-entities/). These allow navigation to associated entities in a single direction – from parent to child. These one-way navigable associations have an icon indicating the type and navigability of associations to the entity properties and the **Add Association** dialog box. These associations also have a special informational banner in the association properties dialog box. Finally, these associations are represented by a dashed arrow in the domain model editor, and there is also an indicator reflecting the direction of its navigability.
* We added the **Annotation** activity to workflows. For more information, see the [General](/refguide/workflows/#general) section in *Workflows*.
* We added the **Autofocus** property to the [Text Area](/refguide/text-area/#autofocus) and [Text Box](/refguide/text-box/#autofocus) native widgets. When set to true, the widget receives the keyboard focus when the page is loaded. 
* We added dark mode support for the **Module Security** dialog box.
* We added new expressions – Subtract Date Functions Calls that allow you subtract a time period from a date and time and return the modified value.
* We added `addQuarters` and `addQuartersUTC` functions to Add Date Function Calls.

### Improvements

#### Performance Improvements

* The performance of editing domain models in large apps has been significantly improved.

#### Other Improvements

* We brought back switching between consequent tabs of the open documents using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Page Down</kbd>. As a bonus, it is now also possible to switch to a particular tab using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>-<kbd>0</kbd> where 1 till 0 is the position of the tab. (Ticket 147599)
* We changed the way error responses for requests to published OData services are formatted. When the client does not specify an `Accept` header, the `Content-Type` is `application/json`, where it used to be `application/xml`.
* We fixed the JSON representation of errors in published OData services. The error code is now a string instead of a number.
* We simplified how to select the metadata from a file or URL for a consumed OData service in Studio Pro.
* Failed workflows can now be aborted.
* We improved the user feedback on the workflow client actions in case the action cannot be performed based on the state of the data. In those cases, a more descriptive (and translatable) pop-up message is shown to the end-user explaining the problem instead of the generic "An error has occurred, please contact your System Administrator" message. The corresponding microflow actions will still throw exceptions in those cases (although the messages are using the same translatable texts).
* MxAssist Logic Bot now always shows a parameterized list for the **Loop through a list**, **Change variable**, and **Create variable** recommendations.

### Fixes

* We fixed [CVE-2022-34466](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#34466).
* We made additional optimizations on top of Studio Pro [9.12](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.12/) to further improve the client performance of data sources returning many items. (Ticket 126837)
* We fixed an error that appeared when closing a dialog box with the **X** button while changing a grid value. (Ticket 146714)
* We fixed an issue with comparing autonumbers in nanoflows. (Ticket 146737)
* We fixed an issue that occurred when adding an access rule while creating an entity, which caused an invalid consistency error. (Tickets 146865, 150646)
* We fixed a deadlock error that occurred in the task queue for scheduled events when using SQL Server. (Tickets 148524, 149049, 149073, 149354, 149687)
* We fixed a problem where Autonumbers incremented twice if the `DataStorage.QueryPlan` log node was set to `TRACE`. (Ticket 149016)
* We fixed issues where changes in a document did not propagate to documents that were dependent on it. This resulted in error messages not showing up or not disappearing until you ran the app.
* We fixed an issue with the reference selector placeholder color not being correctly set. (Ticket 133479)
* We fixed an issue where the **OK**, **Cancel**, and **Help** buttons were constantly "shaking" in the **App Security** dialog box.
* We fixed an issue where a drop-down list was opening outside the parent dialog box.
* We fixed an issue affecting app deployment, specifically in apps whose microflows used an expression over a system association (such as **System.Owner**).
* We fixed a Runtime exception that occurred when using XPath constraints comparing Boolean expressions (for example, `[(Attr1 > 42) = (Attr2 < 7)]`).
* We fixed an issue where selecting an entity over an association in the data source wizard resulted in a consistency error.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide/consumed-odata-service/) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
    * Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
