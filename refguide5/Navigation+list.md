A navigation list can be used to attach an action to an entire row. Such a row is called a navigation list item.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

## Common properties

### Class

The class property allows you to specify a cascading style sheet (CSS) class for the widget. This class will be applied to the widget in the browser and the widget will get the corresponding styling. The class should be a class from the theme that is used in the project. It overrules the default styling of the widget.

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

Note that the styling is applied in the following order:

1.  Default styling defined by the theme the project uses.
2.  The 'Class' property of the widget.
3.  The 'Style' property of the widget.

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Style

The style property allows you to specify additional CSS styling. If a class is also specified, this styling is applied _after_ the class.

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

background-color:blue;
This will result in a blue background

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

# Navigation list item

Each row in the navigation list is a navigation list item. A navigation list item can be associated with an action.

## General

### Action

Action defines what action is performed when a navigation list item is 'clicked'. This can either be opening a page or calling a microflow. For opening a page see [Opening Pages](Opening+Pages) and for calling a microflow see [Starting Microflows](Starting+Microflows). Microflows attached to a navigation list item have no Confirmation or Advanced microflow settings.

## Visibility properties

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}
Conditional visibility settings were added in version 5.10.0.
{% endmarkdown %}</div>

### Visible

By default, whether or not an element is displayed in the browser is determined by how the page is designed and the user's roles within the application. However, the page can be configured to hide the element unless a certain condition is met. 

## Attribute Condition

### Attribute

When checked, this setting hides the widget unless a particular attribute has a certain value. Only boolean and enumeration attributes can be assigned to this purpose.

A practical example would be a web shop in which the user must submit both billing and delivery information. In this case you might not wish to bother the user with a second set of address input fields unless he or she indicates that the billing and delivery address are not the same. You can accomplish this by making the delivery address fields conditionally visible based on the boolean attribute SameBillingAndDeliveryAddress.

### Module roles

The widget can be made visible to a subset of the user roles available in your application. When activated, this setting will render the widget invisible to all users that are not linked to one of the selected user roles. Please note that this does not override project security. Any restrictions due to microflow, form, or entity access will remain in effect.
