## 1 Introduction

One of the strengths of Mendix is that it is easy to connect your Mendix application to other systems. The [Mendix App Store](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/index3.html) is stocked with all kinds of connectors and adapters. You are also able to extend your app by using and creating widgets.
