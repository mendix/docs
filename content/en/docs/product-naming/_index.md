## Purpose of This Guide

This guide presents the main Mendix product names, other Mendix terms, and partner terms currently being used in the Mendix Platform UI, the [Mendix Documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/), and the [Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide](https://www.mendix.com/evaluation-guide/welcome). 

The purpose of this guide is to provide guidelines on usage, capitalization, and spelling as well as notes on important details and [terminology history](/product-naming/terminology-history/) where necessary. The goal of providing and applying these guidelines is to reach company-wide consensus on usage.

The purpose of this guide is not to provide a definition for each term. Terminology details are only given here for clarification where necessary. Product definitions are found throughout the Mendix Documentation and Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide, and for the sake of maintenance, they are not duplicated or summarized here.

For a term to be included in this guide, it should already appear in the Mendix Platform UI, Mendix Documentation, and/or Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide.

A term may not already be included in this guide for the following reasons:

* There are no specific usage guidelines or decisions on the term (at least not yet)
* It is a generic term, not branded by Mendix (for example, "domain model," "page," "template," or "layout")
* It is an internal-only term (for example, names of apps or technical terms only used on R&D teams)
* The term does not feature uniquely enough in the UI to require usage guidelines (for example, on capitalization in documentation)
* The term is outdated (meaning, usage of it has been decided against; for examples, see [Terminology History](/product-naming/terminology-history/))
* The term should not be used in customer-facing resources
