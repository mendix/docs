## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how you can find your way in an app project in Studio Pro. At many places in Studio Pro, you can access a handy menu by clicking the right mouse button. Two options are commonly used to find your way through a project and they are called "Go to" and "Find usages." The "Go to," for example, allows you to navigate to the target of a button or to the source of data grid. The "Find Usages" option, for example, allows you to find all buttons that are opening a certain page.

## 2 "Go To" Options

1.  Select **Project** > **Navigation**.
2.  Right-click a menu item and select **Go to target**. Studio Pro now opens the corresponding target of the menu item, in this case a page.

## 3 Finding Usages

1.  In the domain-model, right-click any of the entities and select **Find usages**. Mendix Studio Pro shows all the usages of this entity in the 'Find Results' pane.

3.  Now click **Lock results** in the **Find Results** pane. From this moment on, if you click 'Find Usages', the results will be shown in a second 'Find Results' pane. This allows you to continue navigating while keeping your initial search results open in the first 'Find Results' pane.
