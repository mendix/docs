## 1 Introduction

The **Planning** page provides an overview of the progression of the **Stories** in the **Collaborate** category. This page has three tabs, which are described below.

## 2 Sprint Status Tab

Under this tab, there is a Kanban overview of the **Stories** in the current sprint. You can change the story status to the following:

* **To-do**
* **Running**
* **Done**

There is also a percentage bar of the stories that are done and the deadline date of the current sprint. You can mark the current sprint as completed only when all stories have the **Done** status.

## 3 Burndown Chart Tab

This tab graphically shows the progress of the current sprint:

* **Ideal Burndown** – shows the expected progress if the sprint is completed at a consistent rate
* **Remaining Effort** – shows the amount of story points that still have to be completed
* **New Stories** – shows the amount of new story points added on a specific day
