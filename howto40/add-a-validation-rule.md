## Description

This section describes how to add a validation rule to an attribute.

## Instructions

### Method 1

 **Right-click on the attribute and in the menu choose 'Add validation rule'.**

 **In the 'Rule' section of the menu, choose the type of validation rule you would like to add and specify the parameters if necessary.**

For example if you choose 'Unique', your application will show the error message and refuse the input if the value for the attribute is equal to that of an existing object of the same entity. However you could also enter a regular expression the input value has to comply with to be accepted.

 **Finish by clicking on the 'OK' button. The domain model will now indicate that the attribute has a validation rule.**
