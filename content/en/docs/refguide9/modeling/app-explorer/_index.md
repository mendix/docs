The **App Explorer** shows the complete structure of your app including all documents inside the modules:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/app-explorer/app-explorer.png" class="no-border" >}}

The **App Explorer** consists of the following:

* **App** folder – contains settings and documents that apply to your app as a whole (for more information, see [Apps](/refguide9/app/))
* **Modules**  – contain settings, a domain model, and *documents* that apply to this module (for more information, see [Modules](/refguide9/modules/)) 
    * **Domain model** – a model that describes the information (or *data*) used by your application in an abstract way; one module can have one domain model only 
    * **Document** – an individual file, for example, a [page](/refguide9/pages/), [microflow](/refguide9/microflows/), or a [scheduled event](/refguide9/scheduled-events/). 

## 2 Performing Basic Functions{#basic-functions}

In the **App Explorer**, you can do the following:

* **Filter** – enter the name of a module, folder, or document into the **Filter** field to filter documents of the app and highlight entered text within the **App Explorer**. When filtering by a module or folder name, all content of matching modules and/or folders is displayed. In addition, while focused on the **Filter** field, it is possible to do the following:
    * Navigate the **App Explorer** using <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> keys 
    * Expand a folder or open a document by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> 
    * Clear the filter query by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>
* **Open the document** – double-click the document to open it
* **Select the active document** – click the icon in the upper-right corner of the **App Explorer** to quickly view the active document in the **App Explorer** tree. By default the active document is always selected so you can quickly see where the document you are editing is located. You can change this behavior in the **Edit** > **Preferences** dialog box.
* **Expand all documents** – click the plus icon in the upper-left corner of the **App Explorer** to expand all document and see the whole structure of your app
* **Collapse all documents** – click the minus icon in the upper-left corner of the **App Explorer** to collapse all documents
* **Expand or collapse an individual folder** – to expand/collapse documents in an individual folder click the plus/minus icon or double-click the folder 
* **Perform actions specific to the selected folder** – right-click the selected folder to see what functions you can perform. The list of functions depends on the folder, for example, when right-clicking the **System** module, you can only find usages of this module, while when right-clicking **MyFirstModule** you can add a page, add a microflow, rename the module, export the module package, copy/paste documents, and much more.
