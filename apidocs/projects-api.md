## Introduction

The Projects API allows you to programmatically create a project in your company space and move working copies between the Team Server and the Model Server.

## Error handling

The following errors might be returned by the service. As this API is implemented as an app service, it will only give a HTTP status code 500 in case an error occurs.

| Status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 500 (Internal Server Error) / 560 (Internal Server Error) | An error occurred when invoking the app service. The "faultstring" field will elaborate on the error details.  Please contact Customer Support through [https://support.mendix.com/](https://support.mendix.com/) or [support@mendix.com](mailto:support@mendix.com) if this problem persists. |
| 502 (Bad Gateway) / 503 (Service Unavailable) | The server is currently offline. Please contact Customer Support through [https://support.mendix.com/](https://support.mendix.com/) or [support@mendix.com](mailto:support@mendix.com) if this problem persists. |
| 504 (Gateway timeout) | Your request is being processed but the server aborted the response because the request took too long. Note that the request might have been applied still. Please contact Customer Support through [https://support.mendix.com/](https://support.mendix.com/) or [support@mendix.com](mailto:support@mendix.com) if this happens. |

## Operations

The following operations are available in the Projects API.

### CreateNewApp

The CreateNewApp operation will create a new app and corresponding project. As parameters it requires a project name, a user name that is linked to a Mendix account, an [API Key](authentication) corresponding to that user account, and a project summary. The project summary may contain a brief description of the project.

The `ProjectsAPI.JobState` enumeration can have the values `Running`, `Completed` or `Failed`.

The `Result` element contains the job result, in case it has completed. For `CreateNewApp` this is the Project ID of the newly created app. For `ExposeTeamServerRevisionAsOnlineWorkingCopy`, this is the working copy ID on the Model Server. For `CommitOnlineWorkingCopyChangesToTeamServer`, it's the new revision number for the corresponding Team Server project.

#### Usage From the Modeler
