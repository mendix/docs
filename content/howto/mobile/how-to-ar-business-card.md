## 1 Introduction

Follow the sections below to build a demo. While doing so, you will become familiar with a whole range of augmented reality (AR) widgets, and see them in action. Upon completing this document, you will end up with an interesting demo that can easily be customized for your own purposes. 

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Install Studio Pro and Developer Apps with AR capabilities
* Download the AR widgets from the [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117209)
* Create a new empty page with **Container (AR)** and **ImageTracker (AR)** widgets
* Add your business card png as the **Image** to the **ImageTracker (AR)**
* Obtain 3D objects to add to your AR business card (this document uses Twitter and LinkedIn logos).
* Have a PNG of your business card

Download these widgets:

* **Container (AR)**
* **ImageTracker (AR)**
* **Square (AR)**
* **3D Object (AR)**

When you have completed the prerequisites, your work should look like this:

## 3 Creating an AR Business Card Demo

For this project you will need to start a new project based on the Native Mobile Quickstart App, or use another project with the Native Mobile Resources module imported from the Mendix App Store. First you will lay a virtual business card over your real business card. You will need the **Square (AR)** widget and the imported PNG of the business card you wish to use.

Ideally you should have several recognizable features on your image, specifically an image with a lot of edges and contrast. The business card you are using in this document possesses these traits:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![Business card](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/BusinessCard.png){{% /image_container %}}

After you have added your business card as an image, remember to adjust the physical size in **Image Tracker (AR)** to the exact size of your business card. Choose the width (the longest side) of your business card for this. This will probably be around 8.5 centimeters:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![Image tracker](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/imagetracker-dialogue.png){{% /image_container %}}

Next you will add a virtual image of your business card to overlap the physical business card. To do this, add a
‘**Square (AR)**’ widget to your app’s home page. Note we already added a ‘**Container (AR)**’ and ‘**ImageTracker
(AR)**’ beforehand:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![Square added](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/square-added.png){{% /image_container %}}

1. Double click the **Square (AR)** widget.
1. Select the **Material** tab.
1. Select **Material type** > **Texture**.
1. Select the image of your business card for the **Texture**. This should be the same image as you selected for your
   **Image Tracker (AR)**. When finished your dialog box will look like this:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![Square dialogue](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/square-material-dialogue.png){{% /image_container %}}

5. Go back to the **General** tab and fill out the size of your business card. The important sizes are X for the width of
   your business card and Y for the height.
6. Set **Rotation > X** to *-90* to ensure the virtual image is rotated correctly.

Once this is all set up, run the project and check if it works in the Make It Native app. Here you should see the
virtual business card overlaying your physical card:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![Business card](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/render-only-businesscard.png){{% /image_container %}}

Next, add a picture of yourself to your virtual business card. Drag and drop another **Square (AR)** widget into
**ImageTracker (AR)** and add a picture of yourself to this. In our case we have used a square image with transparent
edges to make it appear round: 

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![Face](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/Face.png){{% /image_container %}}

Go to the **General** tab and place it about 8 cm (*0.08,0,0*) to the right of the first image and match the size with the
size of our business card image. You should now have this image right next to your business card image.

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![render business card](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/render-businesscard-face.png){{% /image_container %}}

To finish this business card demo you need something people can click to find out more about your work. For this you will
add two social media logos: a Twitter one and a LinkedIn one. You can use any 3D object. 

The following settings correctly place them underneath our business card (since scale can differ between 3D objects, this is not guarenteed to work with all 3D objects):

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![twitter 3d object](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/twitter-3d-object.png){{% /image_container %}}
{{% image_container width="300" %}}![linkedin 3d object](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/linkedin-3d-object.png){{% /image_container %}}

Since you are using *.obj* files, you can alter the color or texture within Mendix. Currently, Twitter has a color of #1DA1F2 and Linkedin has #0A66C2:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![twitter material](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/twitter-material-dialogue.png){{% /image_container %}}

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![Completed](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/BusinessCardRender.png){{% /image_container %}}

Now all that is left is to add a nanoflow that opens a URL to the **Events** > **On click functionality**. Create a new
nanoflow with the **Open URL** action. Add your Twitter profile URL here:

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![open url nanoflow](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/open-url-nanoflow.png){{% /image_container %}}

{{% image_container width="300" %}}![call url event](attachments/how-to-ar-business-card/call-url-event-dialogue.png){{% /image_container %}}

Congratulations, you now have a functioning AR business card demo with custom 3D objects!
