## 1 Introduction

An object type decision is an element that makes a choice based on the type of an object which has a known generalization. For each specialization the microflow can continue in a different way. If you want to use the specialized type in the rest of the microflow you can use a [cast](cast-object) action.

See [Entities](entities) to read more about specialization and generalization.

## 2 Input Properties

### 2.1 Object

The type of the input object is inspected to see how to continue.

Let us say you have an entity `Student` and an entity `Professor` which have the entity `Member` as their generalization. For a `Professor` you want to open a different page than for another `Member`. The selected `Member` object is available in the parameter `SelectedMember` and is used as input to the object type decision. Note that there is no sequence flow for `Student`. If a sequence flow is missing, the closest generalization is searched that does have a sequence flow. In the case of `Student` this is `Member`. The sequence flow with the caption (empty) is followed when `SelectedMember` does not contain an object.
