{{% alert color="warning" %}}

For details on how this works in Mendix versions 7.2 and 7.3, see [Navigation in 7.2 and 7.3](/refguide7/navigation-in-72-and-73/). For Mendix version 7.4 and above, see [Navigation](/refguide7/navigation/).

{{% /alert %}}

When enabled, a user accessing a Mendix application from a tablet device will automatically be redirected to this profile. If disabled, a tablet user will be redirected to the [phone profile](/refguide7/phone-profile/). Lacking that, the user will be redirected to the [desktop profile](/refguide7/desktop-profile/).
