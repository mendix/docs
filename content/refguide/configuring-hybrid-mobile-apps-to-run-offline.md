[Hybrid apps](developing-hybrid-mobile-apps) are built in either connected or [offline](offline) mode. This allows you to maintain two mobile device profiles; one for users that are always online and one for users with intermittent connectivity. The Developer Portal builds connected apps by default. Configuring a hybrid app to run in offline-enabled mode can be done in the portal in the Mobile app section by checking the *Enable offline capabilities?* setting.
