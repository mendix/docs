 **Connect an attribute of an entity which is associated with the data view or template grid entity to the reference selector . You can do this by selecting the reference selector and then dragging this attribute from the Connector window to the reference selector. Another option is to right-click on the reference selector and choose 'Select attribute...' or click the '...' button next to 'Attribute path' in the Properties window, and then in the menu that appears select the attribute.**
