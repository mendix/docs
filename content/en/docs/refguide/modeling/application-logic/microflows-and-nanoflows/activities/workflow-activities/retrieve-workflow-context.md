## 1 Introduction

A **Retrieve workflow context** activity can be used to retrieve the selected [workflow context entity](/refguide/workflow-parameters/#entity).

It needs the **System.Workflow** entity as its input. The action determines the return type based on the selected workflow (the configured Context entity of that workflow). A Runtime error occurs if the passed workflow object is not of the right type.

## 2 Properties

An example of retrieve workflow context properties is presented in the image below:
