## 1 Introduction

Backup snapshots for apps running in Mendix Cloud are created every night or on demand, as described in the [Backups](#backups) section, below.

Backup snapshots contain both the database and file documents referred to in the database.

## 2 Creation and Retention Schedules

The pruning schedule applies to nightly backups and backups initiated by users. If you want to keep a backup for longer than scheduled, you have to download the backup.

Backups are retained as follows:

* Nightly backups: 30 days
* Weekly backups (Sunday night): three months
* Monthly backups (First Sunday night of the month): one year
* Manual (user-initiated) backups: three months

### 2.1 Nightly Backups

The **Start Time** of nightly backups in UTC is shown below. The **Local Time** indicates the time at the regional data center; this may vary if **Summer Time** or other adjustments are in place.

The **Estimated Duration** indicates the period during which backups are expected to be taken from apps in that region. Your app can be backed up at any time during this period; the exact period during which backups are taken can change due to factors at the data center that are outside Mendix's control.

| Region      | Replication Region | Start Time (UTC) | Local Time | Estimated Duration |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Bahrain     | Mumbai             | 03:00            | 06:00      | 1 hour             |
| Canada      | Oregon             | 05:00            | 00:00      | 1 hour             |
| Cape Town   | Frankfurt          | 02:00            | 04:00      | 1 hour             |
| Dublin      | Frankfurt          | 23:00            | 00:00      | 3 hours            |
| Frankfurt   | Dublin             | 00:00            | 01:00      | 3 hours            |
| London      | Frankfurt          | 23:00            | 23:00      | 2 hours            |
| Mumbai      | Hyderabad          | 19:30            | 01:00      | 1 hour             |
| N. Virginia | N. California      | 05:00            | 00:00      | 4 hours            |
| Oregon      | Ohio               | 07:00            | 00:00      | 1 hour             |
| SÃ£o Paulo   | N. Virginia        | 00:00            | 21:00      | 1 hour             |
| Singapore   | Sydney             | 17:00            | 01:00      | 1 hour             |
| Sydney      | Melbourne          | 07:00            | 17:00      | 1 hour             |
| Tokyo       | Osaka              | 16:00            | 01:00      | 1 hour             |
| UAE         | Mumbai             | 00:00            | 04:00      | 1 hour             |

Nightly backups start once an app has been successfully deployed to and started in the environment.

If a nightly backup fails, it is retried two more times.

### 2.2 Notes on Retention

The monthly backup occurs on the first Sunday of the month. If the first nightly backup takes place after the first Sunday in the month, then there is no monthly backup retained for that month. In this case, you can download a copy of a nightly or weekly backup if you need to retain a backup for longer than three months.

## 3 Backups{#backups}

The **Backups** page presents options for managing your backups. These are described below.

### 3.1 Create Backup

This automatically generates a backup snapshot from your application data. For more information, see [Creating a Backup](/developerportal/operate/create-backup/).

### 3.2 Upload Backup {#upload}

The sections below present details on uploading data in recent Mendix Cloud versions.

#### 3.2.1 Uploading Data in Mendix Cloud

In Mendix Cloud, the upload creates a new backup item in your backup list, which you can then restore via the regular restore process. This ensures less downtime for your application. 

Once you download something, you can also upload it again. This means you can upload archives containing the following:

* Full Snapshot
* Database Only
* Files Only

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Uploading a **Files Only** archive results in a backup item with an exclamation mark and a warning message. Because the archive does not contain a database, it is not possible to restore it.
{{% /alert %}}

### 3.3 Download Backup {#download-backup}

You can download a backup archive containing one of the following: 

* **Full Snapshot**
* **Database Only**
* **Files Only**

For more information, see [Downloading a Backup](/developerportal/operate/download-backup/).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
As the download archive is generated on request, it is not possible to estimate the file size before requesting a download.
{{% /alert %}}

### 3.4 Restore Backup

You can choose the destination environment to which you want to restore the backup snapshot. This allows you to, for example, restore a production environment backup to an acceptance environment.

If you restore a backup snapshot that was originally deployed with an older Mendix version, you get a warning. You can still restore the data, but you will have to deploy the older model later on.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If the restore takes too long, the system shows a timeout message. In this case, the restore continues behind the scenes; you can track the progress of the restore by inspecting your database free disk space graphs. As long as the database free disk space keeps decreasing, the restore process is still in progress. If the database free disk space is constant, that means the restore process is finished, and you can try to start your application. If you regularly see the timeout message, consider upgrading to a database plan with more CPU cores; this allows the restore process to happen faster.
{{% /alert %}}

For more information, see [Restoring a Backup](/developerportal/operate/restore-backup/).

At the bottom of the screen, you can click **Delete** to delete the selected backup.

## 4 Limitations

Mendix Cloud backups that contain a very large number of files (that is, greater than about 50,000) experience slow performance for all backup operations (create, download, restore, and upload). This is because of the inherent overhead associated with each file.  As the number of files increases, the overhead becomes quite significant and can add several hours to the duration.
