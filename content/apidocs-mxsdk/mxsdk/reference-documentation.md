## 1 Introduction to the Reference Documentation

Below is a collection of links to documentation about the Mendix metamodel as well as external resources you can use as a reference for programming with the Mendix SDK.

## 2 Metamodel

Start learning how the metamodel works by reading [Understanding the Metamodel](understanding-the-metamodel). Continue with [Projects (Metamodel)](projects-metamodel) to learn how the metamodel handles projects in relation to modules and documents. Next, move on to learning how a [Domain Model (Metamodel)](domain-model-metamodel)  works with all its components (attributes, access rules, etc.). The [Pages (Metamodel)](pages-metamodel) page explains how pages, layouts, and page content are structured. The [Microflows (Metamodel)](microflows-metamodel) page describes in detail how you can create and invoke microflows.
