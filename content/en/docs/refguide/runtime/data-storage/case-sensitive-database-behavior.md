## 1 Introduction

Case-sensitive string operations are those that consider upper and lower case as different letters.
Operations that affect strings in queries (for instance, inside an XPath constraint) can be case sensitive or case insensitive depending on the database vendor, version, and configuration used by the Mendix application.

It is also important to note that each implementation of a case-insensitive operation may treat the case normalization of letters differently.
As a general rule, normalization is based on locale. This is either specified explicitly in the database/table, or the database infers it from the Operating System.
This normalization of letters, or case folding, is further described in [Case Folding](https://www.w3.org/International/wiki/Case_folding) on the *World Wide Web Consortium* wiki.

For the purposes of this document we can divide case sensitive operations into three categories:

* Sorting: Indicates the order in which you want objects to be retrieved (alphabetically ascending or descending).
* Comparing: These are operations that involve equality or other comparisons directly in queries (for instance, in the query `\\Entity[Attribute = 'a']`)
* String functions: These are the [contains](/refguide/xpath-contains/), [starts-with](/refguide/xpath-starts-with/), and [ends-with](/refguide/xpath-ends-with/) functions of an XPath.

Unless otherwise indicated below, sorting and comparing strings is case sensitive whereas string functions are case insensitive.
This is affected by the database, table, or column collation, and sometimes by other database specific options.
The available collations and options are vendor (and sometimes version) specific.

## 2 Behavior of Case Sensitivity by Database Type

The following section describes the default behavior of the databases supported by Mendix.

### 2.1 HSQLDB

**Case insensitive** for sorting, comparing, and string functions.

### 2.2 POSTGRESQL

Sorting and comparison are **case sensitive**. They cannot be configured.

String functions are **case insensitive** as they are implemented using the `ILIKE` SQL operator.

### 2.3 DB2

Sorting and comparing are **case sensitive**. For versions below 8.14, all operations are **case sensitive**. There is an exception for both version groups where collation is configured to **case insensitive**, which affects all operations. For more information, see the [Making DB2 Case-Insensitive](/refguide/db2/#making) section of *DB2*.

Does not support sorting on string attributes of unlimited length.

### 2.4 MARIADB & MYSQL

All operations depend on the configured collation.
The default collation is `utf8_general_ci` when the `utf8` character set is used, or `latin1_swedish_ci` when the `latin1` character set is used.
These default collations are both **case insensitive**.

### 2.5 ORACLE

Sorting and comparison depend on the configured collation.
The default collation is `binary`, which is **case sensitive**, but a `binary_ci` is available for case insensitive operations.

It is possible to set different collations for sorting and comparison operations by setting different values to the `NLS_SORT` and `NLS_COMP` "Linguistic Sort Parameters".

Does not support comparison on string attributes of unlimited length.

String functions are implemented by converting all letters to uppercase using the database's `UPPER` function and are, therefore, **case insensitive** and insensitive to the `locale` in which they are executed.

### 2.6 SAP HANA

Does not support sorting or comparison on string attributes of unlimited length.

### 2.7 SQL SERVER

All operations depend on collation.
The default recommended collation is `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`.
For more information, see our guide on [Setting Up a new SQL Server Database](/developerportal/deploy/setting-up-a-new-sql-server-database/) and the Microsoft documentation [Windows Collation Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/windows-collation-name-transact-sql).

## 3 Overview of Default Case Sensitivity

This table presents the default case sensitivity by different database types:

| **Database Type** | **Comparison** | **Sorting** | **String functions** |
|------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------:|
| HSQLDB            | I              | I           | I                    |
| POSTGRESQL        | S              | S           | I                    |
| DB2               | S              | S¹          | I³                    |
| MARIADB & MYSQL   | C              | C           | C                    |
| ORACLE            | C¹             | C           | I                    |
| SAP HANA          | S¹             | S¹          | I²                    |
| SQL SERVER        | C              | C           | C                    |

Where the letters have the following meaning:

* **S** – Case sensitive
* **C** – Collation/configuration dependent
* **I** – Case insensitive

¹Operation not supported on strings of unlimited length.
²From Mendix version 8.11.0
³From Mendix version 8.14.0
