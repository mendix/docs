## 1 Introduction

Most Mendix Platform APIs require their users to authenticate themselves. This is done by using API keys.

## 2 Obtaining API Keys

To obtain a Mendix API key, follow the instructions in the [API Keys](/developerportal/mendix-profile#api-key) section of *Mendix Profile*.

## 3 Using Authentication Headers

Any call to the Mendix Platform APIs should be authenticated using the following request headers:

* `Mendix-Username` – the login name of the requesting user with the required privileges in the Mendix Platform
* `Mendix-ApiKey` – the API key of this user
