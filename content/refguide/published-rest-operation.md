## 1 Introduction

A published REST operation is part of a [published REST resource](published-rest-resource) and defines an endpoint that a client can call to get, put, post, patch, or delete items from the resource.

## 2 General

### 2.1 Method

The method specifies what type of operation is performed by the microflow:

* `GET` – the operation retrieves the entry or entries at the specified location
* `PUT` – the operation replaces the entry or entries at the specified location, or it creates them if they do not exist
* `POST` – the operation creates an entry in the collection at the specified location
* `PATCH` – the operations updates (part of) the entry at the specified location
* `DELETE` – the operation deletes the entry or entries at the specified location

### <a name="operation-path"></a>2.2 Operation Path

The location where the operation can be reached starts with the location of the resource.

The operation path specifies the remainder of the location of the operation. You can leave it empty to use the location of the resource.

You can use [path parameters](published-rest-path-parameters) to capture part of the location as a microflow parameter. Specify path parameters in the operation path between `{` and `}`. The microflow (see below) should have a parameter with the same name. Whatever is in the URL at the place of the path parameter will be passed to the microflow.

The method and operation path determine [which operation gets executed for a given request URL](published-rest-routing).

### <a name="example-location"></a>2.3 Example Location

The example location gives an example of a URL on which the operation can be reached. It shows path parameters and query parameter values as placeholders between `{` and `}`.

### 2.4 Microflow

Specify the microflow that implements the operation. These are the characteristics of a valid microflow for a REST operation:

* It returns an [HttpResponse](http-request-and-response-entities#http-response) object that is not *empty*
* It takes all [path parameters](published-rest-path-parameters) specified in the operation path as parameters
* It allows all roles that the service allows
* It may have an [HttpRequest](http-request-and-response-entities#http-request) parameter, which you can use to inspect the incoming request
* It should not have any other *Object* or *List* parameters

Any remaining microflow parameters will be treated as optional [query parameters](published-rest-query-parameters).

If the microflow throws an unhandled exception, the response is **500: Internal server error**.

### 2.5 Allowed Roles

The allowed roles define which [module role](module-role) a user must have to be able to access the service.

## 3 Public Documentation

The public documentation is used in the service's [OpenApi (Swagger) documentation page](published-rest-services#interactive-documentation).

### <a name="summary"></a>3.1 Summary

The summary provides a short description of what the operation does.

### <a name="description"></a>3.2 Description

The description provides a complete overview of what the operation does. You can use [GitHub-flavored markdown](gfm-syntax) for rich text.
