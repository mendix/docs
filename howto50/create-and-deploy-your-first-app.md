## 1\. Preparation

Before starting this how-to, please make sure you have completed the following steps:

*   Create an account with Mendix [here](http://www.mendix.com/try-now/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=signup).
*   Download and install the Mendix Modeler [here](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/modelers).

## 2\. Create a collaboration project

With Mendix you can manage requirements, build applications under version control and deploy them into the cloud. Normally you would use multiple different environments for this, but Mendix is truly your one-stop-shop for enterprise application development. To manage your applications from idea to deployment we use projects. In this step you'll learn how to create a project yourself.

1.  Go to [http://home.mendix.com/](http://home.mendix.com/).
2.  Click on **CREATE NEW APP**.
