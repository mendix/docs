## 1 Introduction

A container is a layout element that can be used to simultaneously style, hide, drag, or delete a group of widgets placed in it:

![Container Example](attachments/container-widgets/container-example.png)

In a browser, it is rendered as a simple `div` element by default. It is also possible to render a container as one of HTML5 semantic elements (for example, `section`, `main`, `article`, `nav`).

## 2 Properties

An example of container properties is represented in the image below:
