## 1 Introduction

The [IMAP/POP3 Incoming Email](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/1042/) module enables your app to retrieve emails from POP3, POP3S, IMAP, and IMAPS servers. In order for Mendix to act on incoming email, you can implement this module and model all the actions around it.

### 1.1 Typical Usage Scenario

* Retrieve emails and act like an email client, which is the recommended approach when hosting your application in the Mendix Cloud.

### 1.2 Features

* Configuration of multiple accounts
* Supported protocols:
    * POP3 and POP3S
    * IMAP and IMAPS
* Actions to be performed after receiving emails:
    * Delete from server
    * Move to a folder (for example, an archive)
* Subscribe to incoming email
    * Supports the IMAP and IMAPS protocol only
    * A microflow can be configured to execute for new incoming email
* Unsubscribe from incoming email
    * Removes the subscription (if it exists)

## 2 Configuration

The basic setup and reception of emails can be done using the **EmailAccount_Overview** page, which is in the **ExamplePages** folder under **USE_ME**. Link this page in your app to configure the email server.

Provide a value for the `EncryptionKey` constant available in the **USE_ME** folder for email account password encryption. 

### 2.1 Account Settings

The **Account Settings** window includes the following options:

* Select the **Sanitize email to prevent XSS attacks** option to enable the removal of malicious scripts to prevent XSS attacks. This option is unselected by default. To learn more about this option, see [Sanitize untrusted HTML (to prevent XSS)](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer).
* When **Replicate everything in [Folder Name]** is not checked, the module will fetch the number of emails defined in **Number of emails to retrieve from server** configuration based on the selected **Fetch strategy**.
* When **Replicate everything in [Folder Name]** is checked, then module will fetch all the emails (in order of oldest to newest) from that folder in batch size as mentioned in **Email Batch Size** configuration.
* The **Timeout** field is the connection timeout for sending and receiving email operations. This can be set in the **Email Account** object.

Some **Account Settings** might be unavailable in earlier Mendix versions.

## 3 Usage

Using a Java action in a microflow requires an email account for input. Please make sure you configure the setup first. 

* To invoke receiving emails from an account, call the **RetrieveEmailMessages** action.
* To subscribe to incoming email from an account, call the **SubscribeToIncomingEmail** action.
* To unsubscribe from incoming email from an account, call the **UnsubscribeFormIncomingEmail** action.

In the **Private** folder, we provide microflows to support what we have built and provide guidance for your own needs. Any changes you make to these will be overwritten if you upgrade to a new version.

## 4 Configuring Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) OAuth 2.0 {#configure-azure-ad}

You can configure your account to authenticate with Microsoft Azure AD OAuth 2.0. You can only add one OAuth 2.0 configuration for each app.

Click the **Add Account** button to add a new account, and select the option **Configure using Microsoft Azure AD**. If the account is already registered on the Azure portal, the required fields will already be filled in. If not, or if you need to make changes, you will need to register your app on the Azure portal.

### 4.1 Registering Your App on the Azure Portal

To register your app, follow Microsoft's [Tutorial: Register an app with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory).

While registering, set the redirect URI to `https://(yourapp_domain)/callback/azure`.

### 4.2 Enable Permissions in the Azure Portal

On the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), ensure that you have the following permissions enabled under **API permissions** tab on the sidebar:

### 4.3 Client ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret 

The **IMAP/POP3 Incoming Email** module requires a **Client ID**, **Tenant ID** and **Client Secret**. These will be available on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) once you have registered your app.

### 4.4 Configure After-Startup Microflow

To configure the After-Startup microflow in Studio Pro, do the following:

1. In the **App Explorer**, go to **Settings** and open **App Settings**.
2. Go to the **Runtime** tab.
3. In **After-Startup**, select the **ASU_RegisterHandlers** microflow.
