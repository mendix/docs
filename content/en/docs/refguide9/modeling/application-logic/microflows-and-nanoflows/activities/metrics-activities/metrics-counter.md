There are two sets of properties for this activity, those in the dialog box on the left, and those in the properties pane on the right.

The **Counter** properties pane consists of the following sections:

* [Action](#action)
* [Common](#common)

## Action Section {#action}

The **Action** section of the properties pane shows the action associated with this activity.

You can open a dialog box to configure this action by clicking the ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to the action.

You can also open the dialog box by double-clicking the activity in the microflow or right-clicking the activity and selecting **Properties**.

### Name

The name of the counter whose value you want to increment, which must adhere to the following rules:

* The name can only contain alpha-numeric characters, dots or underscores.
* The name must start with a letter.
* The name cannot start with `mx`, because this prefix is reserved for Mendix internal metrics.
* The name is case-insensitive.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
It is recommended to use a common prefix that uniquely defines your organization and application.
{{% /alert %}}

### Value

The value used to increment the counter's value. Values are specified with [expressions](/refguide9/expressions/) and should be of type Integer/Long. It is only possible to increment the counter, so values cannot be negative.

### Tags

You can specify a list of tags to enrich the counter name with key/value pairs. See [Tag Naming](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_tag_naming) on the Micrometer site for more guidance on using tags.
