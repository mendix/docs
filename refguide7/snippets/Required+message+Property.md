### Required message

This property determines the message that is shown to the end user if the widget is empty and the 'Required' property is set to true. This is a translable text. See [Translatable Texts](translatable-texts).

<div class="alert alert-info">{% markdown %}

For example, if an address field is required, the required message for the text box of the address could be something like "The address is required."

{% endmarkdown %}</div>
