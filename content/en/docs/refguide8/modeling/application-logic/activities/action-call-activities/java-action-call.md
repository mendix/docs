### Java Action

The Java action that is called by this activity.

### Arguments

Click **Edit** next to the parameter to fill in the arguments. 

An argument is the input data that you are passing to the Java action. For each Java action parameter, you must supply an argument of the same type. 

The values of the arguments are defined using [expressions](/refguide8/expressions/):

### Return Type

This read-only property indicates whether you will retrieve a variable, object or list. The return type is defined by the Java action. 

### Use Return Value

If **User return value** is set to *Yes* you will be asked to give the return value a name.

### Variable Name, Object Name, or List Name

The result of the Java action will be given this name. The label indicates whether the result is a variable, object, or list. If it is an object or list, the **Return type** will indicate the entity which is being returned.
