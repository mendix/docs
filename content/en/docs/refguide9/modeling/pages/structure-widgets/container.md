## 1 Introduction

A container is a layout element that can be used to simultaneously style, hide, drag, or delete a group of widgets placed in it:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/pages/structure-widgets/container/container.png" alt="Container Example" class="no-border" >}}

In a browser, it is rendered as a simple `div` element by default. It is also possible to render a container as one of HTML5 semantic elements (for example, `section`, `main`, `article`, `nav`).

## 2 Properties

An example of container properties is represented in the image below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/modeling/pages/structure-widgets/container/container-properties.png" alt="Container Properties"   width="300"  class="no-border" >}}

Container properties consist of the following sections:

* [Accessibility](#accessibility)
* [Common](#common)
* [Design Properties](#design-properties)
* [General](#general)
* [Events](#events)
* [Visibility](#visibility)

### 2.1 Accessibility {#accessibility}

#### 2.1.1 Hide for Screen Readers 

This property specifies whether to hide the container from screen readers or not.

{{% alert color="info" %}} The container should not have any focusable elements inside such as input elements, links, or buttons. These elements will cause the container to be announced by screen readers.
