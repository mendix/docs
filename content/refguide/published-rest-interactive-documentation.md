Every [Published REST service](published-rest-service) is automatically documented. This documentation is available in the app under `http://yourapp.com/rest-doc/`.

Each service has an interactive documentation page using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/). You can interact with the service to see how it behaves.

See [Open API 2.0 documentation](open-api) for more information
