## 1 Introduction {#native-mobile-styling}

This guide will contextualize the style elements Mendix uses in native mobile apps, as well as explain the classes and style properties of Mendix’s widgets. To learn the basics of native styling, you can consult [Designing Mobile User Interfaces](/refguide9/mobile/designing-mobile-user-interfaces/).

Mendix apps use layouts to dictate how pages can look and function. For native mobile apps specifically, you can use a native layout to easily integrate navigation and settings optimized for native functionality. For more information on layouts, see [Layout](/refguide9/layout/).

To keep widgets responsive, Mendix apps use Flexbox. Using Flexbox, a component can set the layout of its child components. This allows your app to retain a consistent layout across multiple form factors. For more information on layout, see React Native’s [Flexbox documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).

You can use the `height` and `width` properties to set a widget component’s dimensions. For more information on size, see React Native’s [Height and Width documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/height-and-width).

## 2  Style Objects {#style-objects}

A widget is composed of various elements, and each can be styled individually. You can customize your widgets using style objects. A style object is a JavaScript object with a set of attributes specific for each widget. Some of the attributes reuse properties of other elements, such as React Native’s ViewStyle, TextStyle, ImageStyle, and Colors elements. You can consult the following property sets for more information on styling properties as you customize your app:

* **ViewStyle** – React Native’s [View Style](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props) property set helps you alter borders, opacity, and other general aspects of your app (the view style property set also contains layout, shadow, and transform properties)
* **TextStyle** – React Native’s [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props) property set will allow you to style text – using these props you can control text’s font, selection status, and more (the text property set also contains layout properties)
* **ImageStyle** – React Native’s [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image-style-props) property set will allow you to style images from network sources, a local library, and temporary local images – using these properties you can alter an image’s size, border, and more, while the image property set also contains layout properties (the `resizeMode` value `repeat` is not supported)
* **Colors** – React Native’s [Color Reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors) property set will allow you to alter colors – you can customize colors using red-green-blue notation, change hue or saturation, and more 

### 2.1  Class Names

Each style object has a name, referred to as the object’s class name. You can create new custom classes, and then apply styling to a single widget by setting a class name onto a widget class property. Here you can see the code for creating a `customClassName`:

```javascript
// A custom styling class
export const customClassName = {
  container: {
    // ViewStyle properties
    paddingTop: 5
  },
  text: {
    // TextStyle properties
    fontWeight: "bold"
  }
}
```

That custom class can be easily accessed in Mendix Studio Pro:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/custom-class.png" alt="custom class"   width="400"  >}}

When you want to apply styling to one instance of a widget, you can extend that widget’s default class. Each widget's default class is named in the [Data Containers](#understanding-data-widgets) section below. The example below shows how to extend a default class:

```javascript
export const ActionButton = {
  container: {
    // ViewStyle properties
    borderWidth: 3
  },
  caption: {
    // TextStyle properties
    fontSize: 20
  }
};
```

Add-on widgets each have their own default styling classes based on their full widget IDs (found in *{widget name}.xml*), and can be created by replacing the dots with underscores. The example below shows a pluggable widget’s default styling class:

```javascript
export const com_mendix_widget_native_badge_Badge = (Badge = {
  text: {
    // TextStyle properties
    color: "#00FF00",
  }
});
```

For more information on creating your own classes, see the [Creating Your Own Classes](/refguide9/mobile/designing-mobile-user-interfaces/native-styling/#creating-your-own-classes) section in *Style Your Mendix Native Mobile App*. That document also shows how to use custom classes as design properties.

## 3  Data Containers {#understanding-data-widgets}

Data containers are essential to many Mendix apps. These widgets will allow your users to create and handle data objects, and can be customized to fit your app’s needs.

### 3.1 Data View Widget

The data view widget shows the contents of one data object. For more information about this widget, see [Data View](/refguide9/data-view/).This widget has no user interface, so it does not support any styling.

### 3.2 List View Widget {#list-view}

The list view shows a list of objects arranged vertically or horizontally. For more information about this widget, see [List View](/refguide9/list-view/). This is not the default list view, but how a list view widget could look in an app:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/list-view.png" alt="list view"   width="350"  >}}

```javascript
export const ListView = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
    numColumns: 1 // This is the number of columns that the list should render.
  },
  listItem: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
    rippleColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2))', // This is the color of the ripple on Android, and will be applied only when the item has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored.
    underlayColor: null, // This is the color while pressing the item on iOS, and will be applied only when the item has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored and defaulted to opacity only.
  },
  listItemDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `listItem`. Overrides `listItem` styles if the item has an on click action and the action cannot be executed or is disabled during action.
  }
};
```

The widget's style properties are as follows:

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | All ViewStyle properties |       |
| `container` | `numColumns` | This is the number of columns that the list should render (defaults to 1). |
| `listItem`  | All ViewStyle properties |          |
| `listItem`  | `rippleColor` | This is the color of the ripple on Android, and will be applied only when the item has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored (defaults to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`). |
| `listItem`  | `underlayColor` | This is the color while pressing the item on iOS, and will be applied only when the item has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored and defaulted to opacity only. |
| `listItemDisabled`  | Same properties as `listItem` | Overrides `listItem` styles if the item has an on click action and the action cannot be executed or is disabled during action. |

The default class to style all list views is named `ListView`.

## 4 Text Widgets

Text widgets are used in almost all app pages. Because of their ubiquity, learning to style text widgets will make a large difference for your apps.

### 4.1 Text

The text widget shows text which can optionally contain parameters. For more information on these widgets, see [Text Widgets](/refguide9/text/). 

```javascript
export const Text = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
  },
  text: {
    // All TextStyle properties
  },
};
```

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | This has all ViewStyle properties. |                 |
| `text`      | This has all TextStyle properties. |                 |

The default class to style all texts is named `Text`.

### 4.2 Page Title 

The page title widget shows the title of the page on which it is used. This can be the title defined on the page itself, or the override title defined when showing a page. For more information on this widget, consult [Page Title](/refguide9/page-title/). 

```javascript
export const PageTitle = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
  },
  text: {
    // All TextStyle properties
  },
};
```

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | This has all ViewStyle properties. |                 |
| `text`      | This has all TextStyle properties. |                 |

The default class to style all page titles is named `PageTitle`.

## 5 Structure Widgets

Structure  widgets are a set of tools that allow you to provide structure for your page’s content. There is also a specific widget called container widget detailed below. For more information on these widgets, see [Structure](/refguide9/structure-widgets/).

### 5.1 Layout Grid

The layout grid widget can be used to structure the content on your page. You are able to create rows and columns which you can configure to have fixed or dynamic sizing.

The widget’s style properties are divided over several objects: `LayoutGrid`, `row`, `noGuttersRow`, `col`, `colFitToContent`, `col1`, `col2`, `col3`, `col4`, `col5`, `col6`,  `col7`, `col8`, `col9`, `col10`, `col11`, `col12`, and `noGutters`.

`col` is being applied when the Width property on a column is *Auto-fill*.

`colFitToContent` is being applied when the Width property on a column is *Auto-fit content*.

`col1`, `col2`, `col3`, `col4`, `col5`, `col6`,  `col7`, `col8`, `col9`, `col10`, `col11`, `col12` are applied when the Width on a column property is *Manual*. Only one class is applied based on the related Size property.

`noGuttersRow` (Row) and `noGutters` (Column) are being applied when the Spacing between columns property on a row is set to *No*.

### 5.2 Container 

A container widget can be used to style or hide a group of widgets. This widget does not have a visual representation by default, though styling can be used to add spacing. 

```javascript
export const Container = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
    rippleColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)', // This is the color of the ripple on Android, and will be applied only when the container has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored.
    underlayColor: null, // This is the color while pressing the container on iOS, and will be applied only when the container has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored and defaulted to opacity only.      
  },
  containerDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `container`. This overrides `container` styles if the there is an on click action set and the action cannot be executed or is disabled during action.
  },
};
```

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | This has all ViewStyle properties. |        |
| `container` | `rippleColor` | This is the color of the ripple on Android, and will be applied only when the container has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored (defaults to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`). |
| `container`  | `underlayColor` | This is the color while pressing the container on iOS, and will be applied only when the container has an on click action set, otherwise it will be ignored and defaulted to opacity only. |
| `containerDisabled` | Same properties as `container` | This overrides `container` styles if the there is an on click action set and the action cannot be executed or is disabled during action. |

The default class to style all page titles is named `Container`.

### 5.3 Tab Container

Tab containers are used to show information categorized into multiple tab pages. Tab containers can help display information which exceeds a device’s screen space. This is how a default tab container widget could look in an app:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/tab-container.png" alt="tab container"   width="350"  >}}

```javascript
export const TabContainer = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties   
  },
  tabBar: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
    bounces: null, // This is a Boolean value indicating whether the tab bar bounces when scrolling.
    pressColor: null, // This is a color for material ripple (Android only).
    pressOpacity: null, // This is opacity for a pressed tab.
    scrollEnabled: null, // This is a Boolean value enabling scrollable tabs.
    tabBarPosition: 'top' // This is the position of the tab bar in the tab view, and possible values are `top` and `bottom`. 
  },
  indicator: {
    // All ViewStyle properties   
  },
  tab: {
    // All ViewStyle properties   
  },
  label: {
    // All TextStyle properties   
  },  
  activeLabel: {
    // All TextStyle properties   
  },
  badgeContainer: {
    // All ViewStyle properties   
  },
  badgeCaption: {
    // All TextStyle properties   
  },
};
```

The default class to style all tab containers is named `TabContainer`.

### 5.4 Scroll Container

A scroll container is used to make enable scrolling for a part of a page. This widget does not have a visual representation by default, though styling can be used to add spacing. 

```javascript
export const ScrollContainer = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
  },
};
```

| Element | Style Properties    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | This has all ViewStyle properties. |            |

The default class to style all scroll containers is named `ScrollContainer`.

## 6 Input Elements

Input elements are typically used to show data to the user and allow them to edit data. For more information on these widgets, see [Input Elements](/refguide9/input-widgets/).

### 6.1 Text Box {#text-box}

A text box can be used to display or edit a textual value. This is how a text box widget with validation feedback and a plain text box widget could look in an app:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/text-box.png" alt="text box"   width="350"  >}}

```javascript
export const TextBox = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties   
  },
  containerDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `container`. Overrides `container` styles if the text box is non-editable.   
  },
  input: {
    // All TextStyle properties
    autoCapitalize: 'sentences', // This is a Boolean value indicating whether the tab bar bounces when scrolling. This automatically capitalizes certain characters when the user types: 
    // 'characters': capitalizes all characters 
    // 'words': capitalizes the first letter of each word 
    // 'sentences': capitalizes the first letter of each sentence (default) 
    // 'none': capitalizes nothing
    placeholderTextColor: null, // This is the text color of the placeholder string.
    selectionColor: null, // This is the highlight and cursor color of the text input.
    underlineColorAndroid: null, // This is the color of the `input` underline.
  },  
  inputFocused: {
    // Same properties as `input`. Overrides `input` styles if the text box is focused (with Studio Pro v8.15).
  },
  inputError: {
    // Same properties as `input`. Overrides `input` styles if there are validation errors.  
  },
  inputDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `input`. Overrides `input` styles if the text box is non-editable.
  },
  label: {
    // All TextStyle properties
    numberOfLines: 1 // This is the maximum number of lines to wrap the label text. If the text is any longer, it will be cut off with an ellipsis.  
  },
  labelDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `label`. Overrides `label` styles if the text box is non-editable.
  },
  validationMessage: {
    // This has all TextStyle properties.
  },  
};
```

| `validationMessage` | This has all TextStyle properties.   |    |

The default class to style all text boxes is named `TextBox`.

### 6.2 Text Area

A text box can be used to display or edit a textual value with multiple lines. This widget supports the same style properties and structure as the [Text Box](#text-box) widget above. This is how a text area widget with validation feedback and a plain text area widget could look in an app:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/text-area.png" alt="text area"   width="350"  >}}

The default class to style all text areas is named `TextArea`.

### 6.3 Drop-Down {#drop-down}

A drop-down is an input widget that can be used to display and edit enumeration attributes.

Since Studio Pro v8.11, the drop-down widget has a new style property called `useUniformDesign: boolean` which enables the uniform design in both platforms.

```javascript
export const DropDown = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties   
  },
  containerDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `container`. Overrides `container` styles if the text box is non-editable.   
  },

### 6.4 Checkbox

A checkbox input widget can be used to display and edit Boolean attributes and is rendered as either a switch or a checkbox. This is how a checkbox widget in switch render mode looks by default:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/check-box.png" alt="checkbox"   width="350"  >}}

This is how a checkbox widget in checkbox render mode looks by default:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/check-box-checkbox.png" alt="checkbox in checkbox render mode"   width="350"  >}}

```javascript
export const Checkbox = {
  container: {
    // All ViewStyle properties
  },
  containerDisabled: {
    // All ViewStyle properties. Same properties as `container`. Overrides `container` styles if the text box is non-editable.
  },
  label: {
    // This has all TextStyle properties.
    numberOfLines: 1 // The maximum number of lines to wrap the label text. If the text is any longer it will be cut off with an ellipsis.
  },
  labelDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `label`. Overrides `label` styles if the checkbox is non-editable.

    thumbColorOff: null, // Color of the foreground switch grip when turned off. If this is set on iOS, the switch grip will lose its drop shadow.
  },
  inputError: {
    // This has the same properties as `input`. Overrides `input` styles if there are validation errors.
  },
  inputDisabled: {
    // This has the same properties as `input`. Overrides `input` styles if the checkbox is non-editable.
  },
  
  // The following properties are only used for the render mode: Checkbox
  checkboxInput: {
    // This has all ViewStyle properties.
    // Render mode: Checkbox.

### 11.30 Switch

A switch input widget can be used to display and edit Boolean attributes and is rendered as a switch. This is how a Switch widget looks by default:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/mobile/native-mobile/native-styling-refguide/check-box.png" alt="checkbox"   width="350"  >}}

```javascript
export const com_mendix_widget_native_switch_Switch = {
  container: {
    // This has all ViewStyle properties. 
  },
  containerDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `container`. Overrides `container` styles if the text box is non-editable.
  },
  input: {
    // This has all TextStyle properties. 
    trackColorOn: null, // Custom color for the switch track when turned on.
    trackColorOff: null, // Custom color for the switch track when turned off.
    thumbColorOn: null, // Color of the foreground switch grip when turned on. If this is set on iOS, the switch grip will lose its drop shadow.
    thumbColorOff: null, // Color of the foreground switch grip when turned off. If this is set on iOS, the switch grip will lose its drop shadow.
  },
  inputError: {
    // This has the same properties as `input`. Overrides `input` styles if there are validation errors.
  },
  inputDisabled: {
    // This has the same properties as `input`. Overrides `input` styles if the checkbox is non-editable.
  },
  label: {
    // This has all TextStyle properties 
    numberOfLines: 1, // The maximum number of lines to wrap the label text. If the text is any longer it will be cut off with an ellipsis.
  },
  labelDisabled: {
    // Same properties as `label`. Overrides `label` styles if the checkbox is non-editable.
  },
  validationMessage: {
    // This has all TextStyle properties.
  },
};
```

### 11.31 Background Gradient

The background gradient widget allows you to apply a background that transitions between multiple colors in a linear direction.

```javascript
export const com_mendix_widget_native_backgroundgradient_BackgroundGradient = {
  container: {
    // This has all ViewStyle properties. 
  },
  colorList: {
    color: null, // Colors can be passed in different formats. Valid color value formats are #d0d0d0, rgb(115,155,155), or rgba(195,226,226,0.5)
