### Arguments

Depending on the selected document, you will see a list of its arguments in a table. Arguments pass data to the activity.

#### Argument {#argument}

The **Edit argument** button allows you to edit the argument value.  An argument is the input data that you are passing to the document template. For each document template parameter (for each non-nested data view and data grid), you must supply an argument of the same type. The values of the arguments are expressed using [expressions](/refguide9/expressions/).
