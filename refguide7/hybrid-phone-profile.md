For Mendix 7.2 and higher see [navigation profile](navigation-profile).

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

When the Hybrid Phone profile is enabled, users who accesses the Mendix application from a PhoneGap hybrid application running on a phone device will automatically be redirected to this profile. If the Hybrid Phone profile is disabled, phone users will be redirected to the [Hybrid Tablet Profile](hybrid-tablet-profile). If there is no Hybrid Tablet profile, users will be redirected to the [Desktop Profile](desktop-profile).
