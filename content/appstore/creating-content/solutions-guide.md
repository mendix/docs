## 1 Welcome

This Solutions Guide provides information & guidance on how to develop solutions you can sell, on and off the Mendix Marketplace.

Mendix [introduced the Mendix Solutions Vendor program](https://www.mendix.com/blog/introducing-the-mendix-isv-partner-program/) to support the full range of organizations — from startups to large enterprises — looking to develop solutions for sale to multiple customers. Under beneficial terms, Mendix provides Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and startups with a Mendix license for development and operation of Mendix apps to implement solutions for their customers.

Read more about the [Mendix Solutions Vendor & Startup programs](general).

## 2 What is a solution?

What is a solution? Essentially, a solution is any Mendix app that is suitable to be sold to multiple different customers. This means the app is built to match the needs & expectations of a wider range of customers. Sometimes this means the app is configurable at runtime to better cater to the needs of groups of customers. In this case general Mendix development principles & best practices apply - see below for useful links. So you can get started right away, from any template available on the Mendix Platform.

Customers often require more from a solution than it supports out-of-the-box. Whether it is an integration with an existing system in the customer's IT landscape, a change to better match the processes of the customer, or simply an adjusted UI to better match the brand of the customer, these adaptations require more than just a prescriptive Software as a Service (SaaS) solution: you need to allow the solution to be adapted to make it fit the specific needs of the customer.
