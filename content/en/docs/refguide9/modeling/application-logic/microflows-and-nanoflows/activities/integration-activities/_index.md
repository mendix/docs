## Introduction

When working with external services there are several microflow activities which enable you to call the service and perform mapping operations.

The activities described in this document are in the **Integration Activities** section of the **Toolbox**.

The following are the integration activities you can use in your microflow:

* [Call REST Service](/refguide9/call-rest-action/) – calls a REST endpoint
* [Call Web Service](/refguide9/call-web-service-action/) – calls an imported web service operation
* [Import Mapping](/refguide9/import-mapping-action/) – imports data from an XML or JSON document into objects
* [Export Mapping](/refguide9/export-mapping-action/) – exports data from objects into XML or JSON documents, or a string variable
