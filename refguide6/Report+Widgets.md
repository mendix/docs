With reporting, you can create reports over the database data. Reporting is used for creating aggregated information (for example , the total sales per customer).

The difference between a data grid and a report grid is that the data shown in the report grid is not stored in the database. Each time a report is created, the data is retrieved from the database. Data for the reporting widgets is provided by [Data Sets](Data+Sets).

A report can be presented on a [Page](Page) in a tabular form using a [Report Grid](Report+Grid) widget or in a graphical form using a [Report Chart](Report+Chart) widget. If the [Data Set](Data+Sets) corresponding to the report contains parameters, these can be specified by the user via the [Report Parameter](Report+Parameter) and [Report Date Parameter](Report+Date+Parameter) widgets. Note that all of the report parameters are optional, so it is not obligatory to specify all parameters.
