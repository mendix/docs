## Introduction

Some versions of Studio Pro support multiple versions of the Java Development Kit (JDK).
During the installation of Studio Pro one version of the JDK will be downloaded and installed.
If you would like to use a different version of the JDK than the one installed during the installation of Studio Pro, then you can follow the instructions described in this document.

## Downloading and Installing the JDK

You can download the Eclipse Temurin JDK from the [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/) website using one of the following links:

* [JDK 11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11)
* [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17)
* [JDK 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21)

After downloading execute the downloaded installation executable and follow the instructions.

## Configuring Studio Pro

After the JDK is installed you can configure it in Studio Pro in the [Preferences](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#jdk).
