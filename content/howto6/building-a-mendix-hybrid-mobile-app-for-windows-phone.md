## 1 Introduction

You may have tried to build a hybrid app package for Windows Phone, and found out this is not possible in the Developer Portal. You can do this by building the Phonegap Build package yourself.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a Windows Phone app package.

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* A Mendix App with mobile support running in the Mendix Cloud, either in a Free App or on a licensed cloud node
* An account for Adobe PhoneGap Build. You can sign up for an account [here](https://build.phonegap.com/plans)

## 3 Building the Windows Phone Package

### 3.1 Creating the Phonegap Build package

To create a Phonegap Build package using a provided template, follow these steps:

1. Download the Phonegap Build template [here (55KB)](./attachments/wp8_phonegap_build_template.zip).
2. Extract the archive so you can change some files within it. <br>
3. Replace these variables in the `config.xml` file:
    * {% raw %}{{identifier}}{% endraw %} - The app identifier. Must be unique for your application and must be reverse-domain name style (e.g. com.yourcompany.yourapp)
    * {% raw %}{{version}}{% endraw %} - A major/minor/patch style version for the app with three numbers. For example 0.0.1
    * {% raw %}{{name}}{% endraw %} - The name of your app
    * {% raw %}{{description}}{% endraw %} - The description of your app

    After changing these variables, the `config.xml` will look similar to this:
    {% highlight xml %}
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <widget xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
            xmlns:gap = "http://phonegap.com/ns/1.0"
            id        = "com.mendix.sampleapp"
            version   = "1.0.0" >

        <name>My Sample App</name>

        <description>The Sample WP8 App</description>

        .....{% endhighlight %}
4. Save the file.
5. Open the `index.html` file and change the {% raw %}`{{url}}`{% endraw %} to the address where your application is
running (for example, `https://com.mendixcloud.myapp`).
6. Save the file. The part where the URL is used will now look similar to this:
    {% highlight js %}
    ...

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", function() {
        mxapp.initialize("https://com.mendixcloud.myapp", enableOffline, requirePin);
    });

    ...{% endhighlight %}
To create an archive with these changes, follow these steps:

1. Select all the files and directories you extracted.
2. Right click the selection and select `Send to compressed folder`. This will create a new archive file that is ready for Phonegap Build.

### 3.2 Build the Windows Phone App

To build the Windows Phone app, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [Phonegap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/) and upload the archive you created in the previous section. This will trigger a build for Windows Phone, so sit back and relax while your build archive is being created.
2. When the build is finished, download the Windows Phone app by clicking the `xap` button.

You can deploy this xap file to the Windows store, or use it to test the app on a device.
