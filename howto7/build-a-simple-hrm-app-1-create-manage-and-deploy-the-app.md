## 1 Introduction

This how-to is based on the video "Build a Simple HRM App: Create, Manage, and Deploy the App," which is part of the [Getting Started videos](http://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/courses/gettingstarted).

This is the first how-to in a series of five on how to create a simple human resource management (HRM) application. In this how-to, you will learn how to create, deploy, and manage your Mendix application.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* How to create an app

    On this tab you can plan the development of your app by adding sprints and stories. For details on how to manage your application requirements in Mendix by creating and configuring sprints and stories, see [Managing Your Application Requirements with Mendix](managing-your-application-requirements-with-mendix).
2. Click **Develop**:

    On this tab you can see the latest revisions to your app made through the use of version control.
3. Click **Deploy**:
    ![](attachments/18448672/18580898.png)
    On this tab you can see the status of your free sandbox or your licensed cloud node. By default every app gets a free sandbox. When you create an app in the dev portal, the development content is stored in the team server repository.
4. Click **Download Modeler**:

    ![](attachments/18448672/18580894.png)

    Your app will be loaded into the Modeler. On the left side of the Modeler you can find the **Project Explorer**, which lists all of the developer content of your app. You can add pages, logic, and other content here.

    The **Stories** pane in the Modeler displays the stories of the current sprint that you added on the **Capture** tab in the dev portal. Any changes you make will instantly be visible in the Modeler as well as on the Capture tab.
