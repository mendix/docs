The following XPath query aggregate functions are available:

*   [avg](xpath-avg)
*   [count](xpath-count)
*   [id](xpath-id)
*   [max](xpath-max)
*   [min](xpath-min)
*   [sum](xpath-sum)

These functions must contain full queries as their arguments. However, the functions _avg, max, min_ and _sum_ must specify a specific column in the query to aggregate.
