**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

*   Create a microflow
*   Build business logic

## 2 Prerequisites

Before you can start with this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisite:

* Complete the fourth how-to in this series: [Build a Simple HRM App Step 4: Enrich the GUI with Filter Options](build-a-simple-hrm-app-4-enrich-the-gui-with-filter-options).

## 3 Creating a Microflow

In this section you will create a microflow.

### 3.1 Adding an Action Button That Calls a Microflow

To add an action button that calls a microflow, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Employee_Overview** page of the **MyFirstModule** module.
2. Right-click the grid control bar of the data grid in the **Master Detail** container and select **Add button** > **Action**:

    To learn more about action buttons, see [Action Button](/refguide7/action-button) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
    
3. Double-click the new button and change the caption of the button to *Promote*:

    To learn more about a microflow, see [Microflows](/refguide7/microflows) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
5. Click **Select** to select a microflow:

8. Right-click the new button and select **Go to microflow**:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580838.png) 

The microflow should look like this:

### 3.2 Adding an Exclusive Split

To add an exclusive split, follow these steps:

1. Select an exclusive split from the toolbar of the microflow editor:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580836.png) 
     To learn more about exclusive splits, see [Exclusive Split](/refguide7/exclusive-split) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
     
2. Click a point on the line to add the exclusive split to the flow:

    To learn more about microflow expressions, see [Microflow Expressions](/refguide7/microflow-expressions) in the Mendix Reference Guide.

6. Select **$Employee (MyFirstModule.Employee)** from the list of suggestions. This employee object corresponds to the input object of the microflow:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580796.png)
    
7. Add a forward slash ("/") to the value in the **Expression** field. This will show all the attributes of the employee object:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580827.png)
    
8. Select **Level (Enumeration 'Level')**:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580828.png)
    
9. Click **OK**. The exclusive split will now evaluate the values from the Level attribute:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580824.png)
    
10. Double-click a point on the line between the exclusive split and the end event, and then select **Junior** from the **Value** drop-down menu:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580822.png) 
    
11. Click **OK**. When the employee in the input parameter has the Junior level, this path will be executed:

12. Select an end event from the toolbar of the microflow editor:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580820.png)
    
    To learn more about an end event, see [End Event](/refguide7/end-event) in the Mendix Reference Guide.
    
13. Add an end event to the flow:

    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580802.png) 
    
11. Repeat steps 1–10 for the **Medior** path. Make sure that you set the level value to **Senior**. The microflow should then look like this:
    
    ![](attachments/build-a-simple-hrm-app/18580801.png)
    
12. Drag a **Show message** activity from the **Toolbox** to the **Senior** path:

## 4 Viewing Your App

To view your app, follow these steps:

1. Click **Run**, then **Save and continue**, and then **View App**.
