## 1 Introduction

Local accounts, meaning accounts created by a tenant administrator, can access and change their profile information via the **Edit Profile** page. 

For more details on tenant administration, see [Administration](/addons/ats-addon/rg-two-administration/).

## 2 Performing Basic Functions

### 2.1 Opening the Edit Profile Page

To open the **Edit Profile** page, do the following:

1.  Click your profile photo 

2.  Click **Show Profile**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/rg-ats/rg-two-ats/rg-two-profile/profile.png" alt="Edit profile page" >}}

### 2.2 Changing the Full Name 

To change your **Full name** from the **Edit Profile** page, type a new one in a text box. The change is automatically saved. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Full name is displayed in various places in the app, for example, in the test run history. This is not the user name which is used to log in.

{{% /alert %}} 

### 2.3 Changing Password

To change your password from the **Edit Profile** page, do the following:

1.  Click **Change password**.

2.  Enter your new password.

3. Click **Change**.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

To change your password, you need to log in first. If you have problems with logging in, contact your tenant administrator. For more details on tenant administration, see [Administration](/addons/ats-addon/rg-two-administration/).

{{% /alert %}}
