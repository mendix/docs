## 3 Most Used Folders in the Project Directory

When developing an application, the following directories in the project directory are useful for amending the style of the application as well as adding custom widgets and Java actions:

* **theme** – stores the *.css* files that can be used to style the application
* **javasource** – stores the JavaScript actions
* **widgets** – stores the widgets
