There are 2 types of forms, Web Forms and Mobile Forms. As the name indicates, the Web Forms are best suited for viewing in a web browser and the Mobile Forms are best suited for viewing on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. There are many widgets that are suitable for both types of forms though some are uniquely designed for a certain type. For a complete overview of which widgets can be used where, check the [Web Forms](web-forms) and [Mobile Forms](mobile-forms) page.
