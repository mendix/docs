## Introduction

Mendix apps can consume OData services exposed by SAP back-end systems. To do this you need to use the [OData Connector for SAP Solutions](/appstore/modules/sap/sap-odata-connector/), which needs to know details of the OData service which has been exposed. This involves mapping the data structures exposed by the OData service (via the $metadata URL) to entities and attributes of the domain model. This information is created as a Mendix module (*.mpk*) file which can be imported into your Mendix app.

SAP data models reflect an [OData](/appstore/modules/sap/sap-odata-connector/) service or [BAPI](/appstore/modules/sap/sap-bapi-connector/) from SAP back-end systems like SAP Business Suite (SAP ERP 6.0), SAP S/4HANA, and SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

Handcrafting a Mendix domain model for these services would be a lot of work. The [Model Creator for SAP Integrations](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/119968) automates this process by creating a Mendix module for the selected service containing the Mendix domain model which can be imported in your app. The data model also contains additional information such as the URL of the exposed endpoint, a list of collections in the service, and a list of functions provided by the service.

For a BAPI service you will need to download a BAPI Schema. See [Create a Mendix BAPI Module Using the Model Creator](#create-bapi-module) for information on how to use the BAPI Schema.

For an OData service, there are four ways to create the data model:

* [Using the API Business Hub](#APIBusHub)
* [Selecting an API from the SAP Catalog Service](#catalog)
* [Uploading an OData Metadata XML File](#Uploading)
* [Providing the URL to the Metadata](#URL)

### SAP Data Models

The Data Model module contains up to four resources which help to consume the OData Service:

* Domain Model
* Service Root
* Entity Set Names
* Function Names

#### Domain Model

Each Mendix SAP data model has a domain model that describes the information in the OData service. The domain model consists of entities and their relations represented by associations. For more information, see [Domain Model](/refguide/domain-model/).

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/services/sap-model-creator/sap-service-example.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Do not change the names of entities, attributes, or associations in the Domain Model; they need to match the names used by the SAP OData service for the OData Connector for SAP Solutions to work correctly.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Service Root

The module contains a constant whose value is the service root of the OData service. For example, the **GWSAMPLE_BASIC** data model, generated from the SAP Catalog Service using the Model Creator for SAP Integrations has a Service Root which is the constant GWSAMPLE_BASIC which has the value `https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com:443/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC`.

#### Entity Set Names

The enumeration **EntitySetNames** contains a list of the collections in the service. These are entities which can be queried to produce a list of matching objects.

#### Function Names

The enumeration **FunctionNames** contains a list of functions which are exposed by the OData service. To assist in using these functions the domain model will also include an entity for each function, suffixed with the string *Parameters*, which is used to provide the required parameters to the function.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Identify the SAP back-end system and OData service or BAPI you wish to use
* Create an app in Mendix Studio Pro (version 8.18.10 or above)
* For a BAPI you will need to download a BAPI Schema â€“ see [BAPI Schema for Model Creator](/appstore/modules/sap/sap-bapi-connector/#bapi-schema) in *BAPI Connector for SAP Solutions* for more information
* Obtain authentication credentials, if needed, for the SAP Catalog Service or SAP back-end system you wish to use

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
The Model Creator for SAP Integrations will produce a module which is in Mendix 8.18.10. To use the module you will have to create your app in, or upgrade your app to, Mendix 8.18.10 or above.

## Generating an OData Data Model

The Model Creator for SAP Integrations is an app in the Marketplace. Search for it in the Mendix Marketplace, or find it here: [Model Creator for SAP Integrations - OData](https://sapmodelcreator.mendixcloud.com/link/odata). If the app gives you a choice between **SAP OData** and **SAP BAPI**, choose **SAP OData**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/services/sap-model-creator/odata-bapi.png" class="no-border" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The Model Creator for SAP Integrations is not currently available in the Marketplace within Studio Pro. It can only be run in a browser.
{{% /alert %}}

Open the [Model Creator for SAP Integrations - OData](https://sapmodelcreator.mendixcloud.com/link/odata), where you will be asked how you want to generate your model:

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/use-content/services/sap-model-creator/model-creator-wizard-1.png" class="no-border" >}}

There are four ways to generate your data model.

* If your SAP back-end system stores the OData API package on the SAP API Business Hub, you can create the data model from there; select **API Business Hub** as the source and continue with [Using the API Business Hub](#APIBusHub)
* If your SAP API is in the SAP Catalog Service, you can create the data model from there; select **SAP Catalog Service** and continue with [Selecting an API from the SAP Catalog Service](#catalog)
* If you have access to the metadata file, select **Manual** and continue with [Uploading an OData Metadata XML File](#Uploading)
* If you have the metadata URL for the OData service, select **URL** and continue with [Providing the URL to the Metadata](#URL)

### Using the API Business Hub{#APIBusHub}

Your SAP back end OData API is held in the API Business Hub.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
