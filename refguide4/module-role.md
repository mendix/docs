The module roles define which roles users of this module can have. See [Security](security) for more information on module roles and [user roles](user-role) and their relation.

## Name

The name of a module role is used to refer to the module role from other elements in your model.

<div class="alert alert-warning">{% markdown %}

End users do not see the names of module roles. End users (if they create or view user accounts) only see the names of [user roles](user-role).

{% endmarkdown %}</div>

## Documentation

The documentation of a module role is there only for the convenience of the people who use the modeler; it is not visible for the end users.
