These release notes cover changes to the app management functionality and other features of the [Mendix Control Center](/control-center/).

To see the current status of the Mendix Control Center, see [Mendix Status](https://status.mendix.com/). Here you can also see planned maintenance and past incidents.

## 2024

### September 5, 2024

#### New Features

* Deep links have been added to the [Software Composition](/control-center/software-composition/) page to enable unique identification and easy shareability.

### September 3, 2024

#### Improvements

* Recently, performance issues were identified in the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation process, which occurs during deployment package creation. Mendix has resolved these issues, ensuring that SBOM generation and the associated Software Composition capabilities are now fully compatible with the following versions of Studio Pro: 9.24.26 and above, 10.6.12 and above, 10.12.3 and above. 

    Previously supported Studio Pro versions (9.24.22 to 9.24.25, 10.6.9 to 10.6.11, 10.10.0 to 10.12.2, and 10.13) will no longer result in SBOM generation and visibility in [Software Composition](/control-center/software-composition/). Make sure you upgrade to a compatible Studio Pro version to continue to use Software Composition. Any historical data within Software Composition remains accessible regardless of the upgrade.

### July 29, 2024

### June 14, 2024

* We have launched the beta version of Software Composition, which provides visibility into component dependencies for every Mendix application environment.

Components that meet these requirements will get a <text class="badge badge-pill badge-recommended" style="margin-left:0px">RECOMMENDED</text> label.
