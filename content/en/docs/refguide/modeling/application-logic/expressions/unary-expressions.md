## Introduction

An unary minus operator is used to convert a number from negative to positive or vice versa. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}

There is no unary plus.

{{% /alert %}}

## Example

The example below represents the negative value of `8`.

```java
-8
```

When used with a variable that already has a negative value the result is positive.

For example, if `$myVariable` has the integer value `-7`: 

```java
-$myVariable
```

The output is:

```java
7
```
