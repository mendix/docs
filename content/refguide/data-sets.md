## 1 Introduction

A dataset can be used to define the data shown in [reporting widgets](report-widgets) in [pages](pages).

A dataset is defined using either an [OQL query](oql) or a custom [Java action](java-actions). To constrain a dataset, parameters can be defined which can be used in the OQL query or Java action.

Fields for datasets are described below.

## 2 General

* **Name** – The name of the dataset.
* **Description** – The description of the dataset, this is only relevant as documentation.

## 3 Source

* **OQL query** – The [OQL query](oql) which defines the dataset.
*  **Java action** – The interface of the Java action which returns a dataset. The columns and [data types](data-types) of the columns need to be specified in Studio Pro. Based on this specification Studio Pro will create a template for this action.

The following shows an example OQL query that calculates the aggregated total order amount for all orders of a customer for a specific group of customers:

```sql
FROM CRM.Customers As CustomerObj
INNER JOIN CustomerObj/CRM.Orders_Customer/CRM.Orders As OrderObj
WHERE CustomerObj/CRM.Customer_Group = $ParGroup
GROUP BY CustomerObj/Name
SELECT CustomerObj/Name As Name, SUM(OrderObj/TotalAmount) As TotalAmount
```

## 4 Parameters

A dataset can have multiple parameters. Parameters are used to filter / manipulate datasets. Security on datasets is configured based on the parameters. In a Java action, the parameters are used in the generated template.

{{% alert type="info" %}}

In OQL, parameters can be called using a **$** symbol, for example: **$Month**.

{{% /alert %}}

A parameter has the following configurable properties:

* **Name** – The name of the parameter
* **Type** – The type of the parameter: Object, Enumeration or a primitive (for example, Date and time, Integer, Boolean, etc). See [Data Types](data-types) for the possible parameter types.
* **Constraints** – The constraints on a parameter. These constraints influence which values can be selected for parameter input values by the end-user. Constraints can be associated with user roles in the dataset security. There are two type of constraints: ranges which apply to numeric and date parameters and XPath constraints which apply to object parameters.
* **Ranges** – When a parameter is defined as a range the drop-down box in the report shows each range instead of all values within the ranges. Decimal parameters are always ranges.
* **XPath Constraints** – An XPath constraint can be defined using [XPath](xpath). Multiple constraints can be defined on a parameter and each constraint can be associated with a [user role](user-roles).
