## 1 Introduction

The [Auto-Load More](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/50323/) widget loads more items on the list view as the end-user scrolls.

## 2 Usage

1. Place the widget in the same page or snippet as the target list view (as in, right below it).
2. Add the name of the **Target list view** to the widget (which can be found in the **Common** tab of the list view properties in Studio Pro).
