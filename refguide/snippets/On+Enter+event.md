### On enter

The on-enter property optionally specifies a microflow that will be executed when the widget is entered, either by using the tab key or by clicking it with the mouse.

### On enter settings

The on enter settings specify what parameters are passed to the microflow, whether a progress bar is shown and more.

See [Starting Microflows](starting-microflows).
