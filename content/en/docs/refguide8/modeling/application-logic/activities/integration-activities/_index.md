* [Call REST Service](/refguide8/call-rest-action/) – calls a REST endpoint
* [Call Web Service](/refguide8/call-web-service-action/) – calls an imported web service operation
* [Import Mapping](/refguide8/import-mapping-action/) – imports data from an XML or JSON document into objects
* [Export Mapping](/refguide8/export-mapping-action/) – exports data from objects into XML or JSON documents, or a string variable
