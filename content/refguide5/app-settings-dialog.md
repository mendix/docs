The App Settings dialog lets you specify the name of your new app,  the language of your app, whether or not to enable the Team Server, and the location on disk where the project files for your app are stored. These settings are optional; clicking the 'Create app' button will create your app with proper default settings.

## Name

The name of your new app. This name is used as the name of the project directory and file on disk. If you enable the Team Server for this app, the name is also used for the Team Server repository and a corresponding project in the Project Dashboard.

## Default language

The default language is the language of the end-user interface. Choose the language that you will initially use in your forms and other user interface elements. You can always add additional languages to your project later on.

## Enable Team Server

Team Server projects offer version control and collaboration. When enabled, this will create a project in the Project Dashboard and a corresponding version control repository.

If you choose 'No' here, you will create a project that is only stored on your local disk. At a later point in time you can still decide to upload such a local project to the Team Server and enjoy the benefits of version control.

## Disk location

Here you may specify the project directory in which the files for your app are stored. If you enable the Team Server for the new app, you will see that the suffix "-main" will be appended to the directory name automatically. This is to indicate that the directory contains the main branch line of your project. When working on your app, you can always create new branches and download these to other directories.
