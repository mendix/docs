## 1 Introduction 

This how-to explains how to configure a selenium hub in ATS. There are four selenium hub possibilities in ATS. How to configure all the four selenium hubs and where you can retrieve the necessary information is explained.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Configure a Browserstack Selenium Hub
* Configure a Saucelabs Selenium Hub
* Configure a Testingbot Selenium Hub
* Configure a Custom Selenium Hub

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting with this how-to, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* Have the appropriate role to gain access to the test settings in ATS.
* Have access to a selenium provider account or internal selenium server.

## 3 The Test Settings

To get to the test settings follow these steps:

1. Go to ATS and login.
2. Open the app where you want to add the selenium hubs.
3. Once inside your app click the profile menu and click **Show Test Settings**.

The **Selenium hubs** section contains all the configured selenium hubs for this app. Here you add a new selenium hub by clicking **New Selenium Hub**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-configure-a-selenium-hub/new-selenium-hub.png" >}}

The **Select Provider** dialog box opens. Here you select one of the four configurable selenium hub options. Each of the options is explained in the sections below.

{{< figure src="/attachments/addons/ats-addon/ht/ht-two/ht-two-configure-a-selenium-hub/select-provider-dialog.png" >}}

## 4 Custom Capabilities

Each selenium provider allows the user to set certain custom capabilities. The custom capabilities are used to set specific conditions. ATS uses these custom capabilities when you execute a test case or test suite. For example, Selecting 'Chrome' as your browser is a custom capability. ATS will then execute the test case or test suite using Chrome. The different selenium providers allow for different custom capabilities. How to select custom capabilities is explained for each Selenium Hub in the corresponding chapter.

Some examples of custom capabilities are:
* Timezone
* Resolution
* Builds
* Names

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Browser and platform overwrites do not work! The ATS run configuration will overwrite your custom capabilities.

{{% /alert %}}

Custom capabilities are explained separately for each Selenium option in the next chapters.
