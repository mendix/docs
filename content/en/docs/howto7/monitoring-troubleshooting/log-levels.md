## 1 Introduction

Each application has a log and log messages to monitor the health of the running of the application. Log levels are used to distinguish the log messages and to highlight the highest priority ones so that they can receive the immediate intervention they require.

This how-to teaches you how to do the following:

* Configure the log levels for the various occurrence of logging within your app

## 2 Logging Basics

### 2.1 Log Messages

Log messages are notes that appear in the log of your Mendix application that present contextualized and detailed information such as the following:

* Date/time the log was created
* Level
* Node
* Detailed message
* Stack trace

#### 2.1.1 Log Node

The log node name defines the source of the log message. For example, in a log message from the email module, the log name would appear as **Email Module**.

#### 2.1.2 Message

Most messages in the log are auto-generated by the system (for example, **Mendix Runtime successfully started, the application is now available**). However, for logging that has been created via a microflow, log messages can be customized by the developer.

Customized log messages are created by defining a template. The template is the structure of the log’s message, and can be composed of parameters and free text.

In the image above, the template for the message is **Email not sent to customer {1}**. With this example template, when the error occurs, the customer’s full name is inserted into the parameter placeholder **{1}** (for example, the log message would be **Email not sent to customer John Smith**). Accordingly, the log message is customized to the data that is specific to the situation.

#### 2.1.4 Stack Trace

The stack trace is a list of method calls from the point when the application was started to the point where the exception occurred. 

In the Modeler, log messages that include a stack trace are marked with a paperclip icon. Double-clicking this icon shows the stack trace.

### 2.2 Level {#Level}

The log level defines the severity of the log message. In the Modeler, this is represented by different colors and an icon. 

These are the log levels used by Mendix: 

| Level | Icon | Color | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trace | | | More detailed information. These are only written to logs. |
| Debug | | | Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. |
| Info  | | | Confirmation that things are working as expected. |
| Warning | {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/monitoring-troubleshooting/log-levels/18580038.png" >}} | Orange | Indicates that something unexpected happened or that there is some problem in the near future (for example, "disk space low"). The application is still working as expected. |
| Error | {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/monitoring-troubleshooting/log-levels/18580037.png" >}} | Red | Due to a more serious problem, the application has not been able to perform some function. |
| Critical | {{< figure src="/attachments/howto7/monitoring-troubleshooting/log-levels/18580036.png" >}} | White (text), red (background) | A serious error has occurred, indicating that the application itself may be unable to continue running. |

## 3 Setting the Log Levels

In this section of the how-to, you will learn how to configure the log levels of the logging messages produced by the system. The different levels highlighted in [3.2 Level](#Level) can be applied to custom logging and to the predefined logging produced by the Mendix Modeler. 

This section will define how to configure both the log levels in custom logging and the predefined logging created by the Modeler.

### 3.1 Advanced Features of the Console

To access the advanced features of the console, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Console**.
2. Click **Advanced** to open the drop-down menu of advanced options.
3. Click **Set log levels**.

### 3.2 Configuring the Log Levels

To select the level on which a log node will log messages, follow these steps:

1. Set the relevant **Log Node**.
2. Open the **Info** drop-down menu in the **Log Level** column.
3. From the drop-down menu, select the correct level.

### 3.3 Configuring Custom Log Levels

To set the level of custom log messages that you have created via a microflow, follow these steps:

1. Open the microflow in which you intend to change the log messag level.
2. Double-click the log message activity.
3. In the **Log level** drop-down menu, select the correct level.
