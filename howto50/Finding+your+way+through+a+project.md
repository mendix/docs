This how-to explains how you can find your way through a project in the Mendix Business Modeler. At many places in the Business Modeler you can access a handy menu by clicking the right mouse button. Two options are commonly used to find your way through a project and they are called 'Go-To' and 'Find usages'. The 'Go-To' option for example allows you to navigate to the target of a button or to the source of data grid. The 'Find Usages' option for example allows you to find all buttons that are opening a certain page.

3.  Now click 'Lock results' in the 'Find Results' pane. From this moment on, if you click 'Find Usages', the results will be shown in a second 'Find Results' pane. This allows you to continue navigating while keeping your initial search results open in the first 'Find Results' pane.
