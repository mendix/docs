{{% alert color="info" %}}[Machine learning model](/refguide9/machine-learning-kit/) support is available in Studio Pro [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/) and above.{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

Design patterns are implementation patterns for machine learning models. The documents in this section explore [Advanced Inference Design Patterns](/refguide9/machine-learning-kit/design-patterns/advanced-inference/) and [Pre-Processor and Post-Processor Design Patterns](/refguide9/machine-learning-kit/design-patterns/pre-post-processor-patterns/) in further detail.

For detailed information on working with machine learning models in Studio Pro, see [Integrate Machine Learning Models](/refguide9/machine-learning-kit/).

{{% alert color="info" %}}Check out a demo app and Jupyter notebook examples in our [Demo for Mendix ML Kit](https://github.com/mendix/mlkit-example-app) repository for further information on working with machine learning models in Mendix.{{% /alert %}}
