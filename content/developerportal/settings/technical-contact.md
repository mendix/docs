## 1 Introduction

This document describes the role of the *Technical Contact* within the Mendix platform.

The Technical Contact is responsible for license renewal and is the first point of contact for our support department. A Mendix application will always be set up and delivered with a technical contact assigned to it. The Technical Contact needs an *MxID* before Mendix can activate a license for an application.

It is currently not possible to select more than one Technical Contact in the Mendix Cloud. See how to [Change the Technical Contact](/developerportal/howto/change-roles).
For On-Premises installations it is possible to select more than one contact. Contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com) with your request.

## 2 Technical Contact Responsibilities

The responsibilities depend on the type of hosting for your app: On-Premises or Mendix Cloud.

### 2.1 On-Premises (The Mendix App Runs on the customer's own infrastructure)

Managing licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix will send license renewal notifications to the technical contact via email
* If the technical contact would like to expand the license (e.g. more users), they need to contact their Account Executive

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes and incidents.

### 2.2 Mendix Cloud

You are the first point of contact for the app:

* You will receive notifications for upcoming maintenance operations on the application
* You will be able to receive alerts from the Mendix application when problems arise (CPU Load is high/running out of disk space)
* You can configure the alert settings in the Monitoring tab of the cloud node


You can perform all the regular operations on the Mendix cloud node in the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com). Additionally you can manage the access rights of your team members, so they can deploy, stop, start, etc.. For more information, see [Security - Node Permissions](/developerportal/settings/node-permissions).


Licenses (renewals/activation/upgrades):

* Mendix is responsible for Mendix Cloud app renewals
* Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) if you want to expand the license

You can submit requests in the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com) for questions, changes and incidents.
