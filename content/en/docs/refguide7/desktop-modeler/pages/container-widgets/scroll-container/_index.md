A scroll container is used to divide the layout in regions (for details on regions, see [Scroll Container Region](/refguide7/scroll-container-region/) in the Mendix Reference Guide) such as the header, sidebar, or footer. A scroll container must be the only top-level widget. Apart from that, a scroll container can only be placed directly in another scroll container.

Scroll containers may be placed on navigation layouts as well as on pages.

The scroll container splits the layout in three parts: a header containing a logo, a content part with a placeholder and a footer.
