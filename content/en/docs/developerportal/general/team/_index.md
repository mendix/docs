## 1 Introduction

Your team can include all of your colleagues working on an app. As well as developing, team members might have other roles such as ideating or reviewing. The Mendix Developer Portal enables developers from both IT and business with mixed experience levels to collaborate.

To view and manage your team members, follow these steps:

1. Click **Apps** in the top navigation panel of the [Developer Portal](http://sprintr.home.mendix.com) and select the app you want to manage.
2. Click **Team** under the **Collaborate** category.

## 2 Managing the Team {#managing}

Only team members with the [Scrum Master](/developerportal/general/app-roles/#team-roles) role can manage the app team.

On the **Overview** tab, you can do the following:

* Select a new **Role** for a team member (for details on available roles, see [App Roles](/developerportal/general/app-roles/))
* Click **Remove** to remove a user from the team
* Click **Invite New Member** to invite a new user to the team (for more information, see the [Inviting Team Members](#inviting) section below)

Navigate to the **Role Settings** tab to view and edit permissions for the team roles as well as to **Add New Role**:
