## 1 Introduction

The **Planning** page shows all your stories.

The main area of the **Planning** page lists all the stories in different categories. Each row represents a story:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/story-kanban.png" >}}

Each row shows the following information about a story:

* Whether the story is a bug or a feature
* If the story has a feedback item linked to it
* Unique story ID
* Story title
* Linked epic
* Tags
* Number of comments
* Number of the tasks
* Story points
* To whom the story is assigned

On the upper-left corner of the page, you can use the search box to search stories based on story title, tags, epic name, assignee (including unassigned stories), story type (type *bug* or *feature*) and story ID.

On the upper-right corner of the page, you can see two buttons:

* **Create Story** – Clicking this enables you to create a new story.
* Ellipsis (**...**) – Clicking this shows the following options:
    * **Create Epic** – This enable you to create an epic.
    * **Edit Sprint** (only available for [a Scrum workflow](#scrum-planning)) – This enables you to edit the current Sprint.
    * **End Sprint** (only available for [a Scrum workflow](#scrum-planning)) – This enables you to the current Sprint.
    * **Start Sprint** (only available for [a Scrum workflow](#scrum-planning)) – This enables you to start a new Sprint.
    * **Import Stories** – Clicking this enables you to import stories from an Excel file.
        * For more information, see the [Import Stories](#import-stories) section.
    * **Board Settings** – Clicking this enables you configure the board settings.
        * For more information, see the [Board Settings](#settings) section.

### 1.1 Selecting, Moving, Archiving, and Deleting Stories

## 2 Scrum Planning vs Kanban Planning {#different-plannings}

The **Planning** page offers different features to accommodate two different workflows: Scrum or Kanban. Depending on your choice of board type – Scrum or Kanban, the **Board** page looks a bit different.

{{% alert color="info" %}}You can select your board type on the [Planning](/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/#board-type) page.{{% /alert %}}

### 2.1 Scrum Planning {#scrum-planning}

If your board style is Scrum, you can find the features below which accommodate your Scrum workflow.

If there is an active Sprint, on the upper-left corner, you can find the name of the Sprint, when it ends, and how many stories and points it has. If you hover over the goal icon, you can see the goal of the Sprint:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/scrum-planning.png" >}}

In the main area of the page, stories are grouped in these categories: **Active Sprint** (if there is an active Sprint), **Next Sprint**, **Refinement**, and **Backlog**.

On the upper-right corner, you can find these Scrum items if you click the **...** button:

* **Start Sprint** – Clicking this allows you to start a new Sprint. Once a Sprint is created, all the items in the **Next Sprint** are moved to the **Active Sprint** automatically. 
    * This is available only when there is no Sprint running at this moment.
* **Edit Sprint** – Clicking this allows you to edit the current Sprint. When you end a Sprint, the system shows you how many stories were completed in that Sprint. All the completed stories are archived automatically, and you can decide where the unfinished stories should go.
    * This is available only when this is a Sprint running at this moment.
* **End Sprint** – Clicking this allows you to end the current Sprint. 
    * This is available only when this is a Sprint running at this moment.

### 2.2 Kanban Planning {#kanban-planning}

If your board type is Kanban, the stories are grouped in these categories: **To Do**, **Refinement**, and **Backlog**. On the top of each category, you can see the total number of stories and points.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/kanban-planning.png" >}}

## 3 Importing Stories {#import-stories}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}Importing stories is not the right way to migrate stories to Epics, since it only moves your story titles and descriptions, not comments, attachments, or tags. If you need the data of your stories in Epics, make sure to use the [migration tool](#data-migration).{{% /alert %}}

You can import your stories using an Excel file to Epics as follows:

1. On the upper-right corner of the **Planning** page, click **...** and then click **Import Stories**.

   {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/import-stories.png" >}}

   The **Import Stories From Excel** dialog box opens.

2. Click **Download** to download the Excel file template.

   {{% alert color="warning" %}}To prevent errors, we recommend that you use this Excel file template to import your stories.{{% /alert %}}

3. Open the Excel file. Enter the data for your stories as follows:

   * **Depth** – Enter **+** for a story and **++** for a task. A task should be added right below the story to which it belongs.

   * **Name** – Enter the name of the story. For tasks, leave this column empty.

   * **Epic** – If the story is linked to an epic, enter the epic ID. For tasks, leave this column empty.

     {{% alert color="warning" %}}The Epic ID that you enter in the Excel file should already exist in Epics.{{% /alert %}}

   * **Story Type** – Specify whether the story is a **Feature** or **Bug**. For tasks, leave this column empty.

   * **Story Points** – Enter the story points. For tasks, leave this column empty.

   * **Description** – Enter the description of the story. For tasks, leave this column empty.

   * **Tags** – Enter the tags for the story. Use a comma to separate tags. For tasks, leave this column empty.

     {{% alert color="warning" %}}All the tags that you enter in the Excel file should already exist in Epics.{{% /alert %}}

4. Save the Excel file.

5. Go back to the **Import Stories from Excel** dialog box. 

6. Click **Browse**, navigate to the Excel file, and then select it.

7. Click **Continue**. The dialog box gives a preview of all the stories that will be imported.

8. Click **Continue** to import the stories. A pop-up window shows the import is finished.

You can find all the imported stories in the **Backlog**.

## 4 Exporting Stories {#export-stories}

You can export your stories on the **Planning** page to an Excel file as follows:

1. On the upper-right corner of the **Planning** page, click **...** and then click **Export Stories**.

   {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/export-stories.png" >}}
2. Select from where you want to export stories.
3. Click **Continue** to see a preview of the Excel file.
4. Click **Export to Excel**.

## 5 Board Settings {#settings}

When you click **...** on the upper-right corner of the **Planning** page, and select **Board Settings**, a dialog box opens with four tabs: **Manage Tags**, **Board Type**, and **Toast Settings**. These tabs are described in the sections below.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/board-settings.png" >}}

### 5.1 Managing Tags {#manage-tags}

On this tab, you can add, rename, and delete tags, as well as change tag colors. The changes here affect all the tags in your app.

To add a tag, click **+Add Tag**, enter the name,  select a color, and then click the save icon to save it.

To rename a tag, double click the tag name, change the name in the text box, and then click outside the text box to save it.

To delete a tag, hover over the row of the tag, and then click the delete icon that appears at the end of the row.

To change the tag color, click the current color, and then select the new color from the dialog box.

### 5.2 Board Type {#board-type}

On this tab, you can switch between a Scrum workflow and Kanban workflow. The workflow you select determines how the [Board](/developerportal/project-management/epics/board/#different-boards) page and the [Planning](#different-plannings) page look.

### 5.3 Toast Settings

On this tab, you can enable or disable the toast notifications that appear like this:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/toast-notification.png" width="500px" >}}

## 6 Migrating Stories to Epics {#data-migration}

Mendix recommends you migrate your stories to Epics as soon as possible, as Stories has been retired on October 1, 2023. For apps that were using Stories, Epics is now the default project management tool. However, you can now still migrate stories to Epics.

{{% alert color="info" %}}Only a Scrum Master can start a migration. Once you have started the migration, Mendix recommends working on Epics from that point forward.{{% /alert %}}

### 6.1 Migration Process

To migrate from Stories to Epics, follow these steps:

1.  Click the **...** icon on the upper-right corner of the **Planning** page, and select **Migrate from Stories**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/export-stories-menu.png" >}}

2.  Read the information and then click **Start Migration**:

   {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/data-migration-info.png" width="400px" >}}

3.  Select the content you want to migrate.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/data-migration-content.png" width="400px" >}}

A notification is sent in the Developer Portal's [top bar](/developerportal/#navigation) informing you of the status of the migration. An email is also sent with this information. You can open the [migration report](#migration-report) by clicking the notification or the button provided in the email.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Once you have migrated your stories from Stories to Epics, Mendix archives any work you may have had in Stories. You can review your work in [Stories Archive](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/#story-archive) on the **Settings** page of the app, and download it if necessary. 

Mendix will keep this data until October 1, 2024. Until then, you will be able to export it to Excel in case you need an offline copy. Mendix strongly urges you to download your work before that date.

### 6.2 What Is Migrated?

These are the new locations of migrated stories:

| From Stories                    | To Epics                                                     | Additional Information                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Sprint**               | **Active Sprint** on the **Planning** page                   | All stories are migrated to **To Do** swimlane with tags. |
| Rest of the Sprints and backlog | **Refinement** on the **Planning** page                      |                                                           |
| Archived stories                | Archived stories on the [Archive](/developerportal/project-management/epics/archive/) page |                                                           |

These are the new details of migrated stories:

| From Stories     | To Epics                                                     | Example             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Sprint **Name**  | Tag with this format: **sprint:Sprint_Name**                 | **Sprint_Sprint 1** |
| Story **Status** | Tag with this format: **status:Status**                      | **status:To-do**    |
| **Assignee**     | Story is assigned unless the assignee is not a member of the app team. |                     |

For example, here is a Sprint with three stories from Stories:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/data-migration-example-stories.png" >}}

Here is the outcome after migration:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/data-migration-example-epics.png" >}}

Beside the story details above, the remaining details for your stories are migrated according to their equivalents in the [Project Management](/developerportal/project-management/) section in the Developer Portal.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}In Stories, files are associated with Comments, not with Stories. In Epics, files can only be associated with Stories, not with Comments. Therefore, files migrated from Stories will lose their Comment context.{{% /alert %}}

### 6.3 Migration Report {#migration-report}

The migration report is available a few seconds after the migration completes (timing depends on the number of stories you have).

Click **View Migration Report**:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/migration-report-buttons.png" width="400px" >}}

The migration report then opens:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/project-management/epics/planning/migration-report.png" width="600px" >}}

The **Migration Configuration** section presents what you have selected to migrate and the status of that migration. 

The **Not Finished** status means that you can use the **Continue Migration** button option (this button is only available if a migration has failed or there is still some stories data left to migrate).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you still have content with the **Error** status (for example, in the **Unmigrated Stories** section) after retrying the migration via the **Continue Migration** button, Mendix recommends manually migrating that data from Stories to Epics. Furthermore, if a section has been successfully migrated but there is still data that has not been migrated, Mendix recommends manually migrating the data.
